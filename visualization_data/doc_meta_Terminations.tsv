5	Via vmail: I have a question about a one month resignation I received from an employee. After the client found out he would be resigning, they wanted to sever the agreement. We no longer require the employee's services because of this so we would like to cut the one month short. 805-234-1601

2	An employer (grocery store) subtracts any register shortages from their employee's paychecks. The employer ensures that even with the shortage deductions that employee meets the minimum wage requirements each paycheck. If an employee terminates and still "owes" the company money based on previous register shortages, can the employer pull the remaining balance from the individual's paycheck even if this causes the employee to hit under the minimum wage hourly rate?	
5	In CA can we force an employee to have their final check issued by direct deposit vs a live check?	
4	We are working on calculating an annual leave (PTO) payout. I want to understand how the daily rate would be calculated. So if an employee is accruing a certain number of days, in order to pay out that value, how would we calculate the daily rate? We are planning a termination and we are told vacation accrues every day. What is the accrual rate? Do they accrue for all hours? If he works a portion of the pay period, how many hours accrued?	
1	We have an employee who has only been with us for 3 weeks. She's been coming in late, forgetting to clock in/out and last Friday she was a no call/no show. She eventually called to say she'd been in a car accident and would need to be off for Monday too. When I went to cover her shift I discovered that the places she was to been cleaning have not been properly cleaned I'd like to terminate her. Am I okay to do so considering the reason she is out is due to a health reason (car accident).	
2	Do you have access to or have any benchmark data for executive employment agreements as it relates to severance payments. Specifically for a company with around 175 employees in Tennessee. I found a Lee Hecht Harrison and a world at work study. It's difficult to compare to those since company size is important.	
6	Quick Question - we had an individual resign recently. His last day is Friday. I presume that his final paycheck should include his accrued but unused vacation hours?	
4	I spoke to our local police and I will terminate her today and the police will be on site. I have documented all identified fraudulent activity. I also called our liability specialist. I am concerned for what happens after today. I need to make restoration with my clients. I am concerned that when I reach out to them if one of them gets upset there could be a approach that they make against us. Are we in a position to get the money from her?	
4	We are an At Will state (but also have remote employees in various other states), what level of documentation is needed to terminate employment. Cant we just say not a fit? I would like to further officially understand the at will and needed documentation surrounding it.	
4	We have a longer term manager we are seeking to terminate. We recently discovered there have been coupon/discounts that this manager have applied spanning a 2 year period, however these cannot be substantiated in the reporting (e.g. coupons not present, etc.). We do intent to get the police involved. Is the police report necessary to terminate?	
0	We have an issue with a long time employee. This employee has been with the company for many years. He has been counseled and written up on no less than two separate occasions for asking female employees out to lunch or to get a drink. Even after being spoken to about it he then tries to apologize by bringing them flowers and asking them out again. We have had another incident with him, and we have decided that this is the final straw. We are planning to terminate, however, the CEO wants to offer him the choice of resigning (mentioning retirement) and allowing this to be his two weeks' notice. What are your thoughts about this?	
3	Exempt employee provided notice through this Friday but is not returning this week, are we required to pay her for the holidays?	
4	Is Erin available? I am at the end of a long termination. We are ready to terminate her. We held off because we were trying to close a round of funding. The lawyer is advising me, but we have a very small space. It will be a scene if we do it with everybody else there. Should I have them clear the office? How do I do this without tipping her off? I am not physically there so my attending will be a tip off. I am worried she will start videotaping and that it will be a full blown scene. I am worried about the other employees more than her at this point. I want to minimize the impact on our small staff. We have 3 reporters, one of whom is being terminated. The other reporters feel like she is being treated unfairly. Many days she does not come in until 12 (after PT). Should the manager set the meeting? How do we get the lap top? I can have a thumb drive to drag personal stuff onto it? Can we hold her final check if she does not return the equipment? The separation agreement requires the computer and any other equipment be returned.	
6	ThinkHR Team, Please review the question posed by my client, Level 5, LLC below highlighted in yellow. We appreciate your thoughts and comments with regards to the GA DOL regs and state law. Per our discussion, heres the email from Brad that he wanted to propose to the owners. Could you please verify that we are in compliance with any Georgia Department of Labor regulations pertaining to vacation payout and termination/resignation concerns. Thank you for your assistance. I am considering a revision to the vacation policy. I will need to submit the policy to the partners for approval. The proposal: 1. Two weeks vacation - new hires earn vacation hours out of the gate but must work 6 months to get the benefit of vacation. 2. After 4 years the employee begins earning an additional week so that they have 3 weeks vacation in year 5. 3. After 8 years the employee begins earning an additional week so that they earn 4 weeks vacation in year 9. 4. Carry over: * It is our intent that our employees utilize vacation not save it up. * Two weeks is the maximum carry over * Upon Resignation or termination, vacation paid to employees is a maximum of 4 weeks. I want to make sure that they approach above does not materially differ from our current policy in terms of resignation or termination. I also want to make sure that it is legal, meaning they have 6 weeks carried over if the employee has been with the company longer than 8 years but we are only paying 4 weeks.	
6	I've got a company with 225 employees in Texas. They are in 11 other states. They are wanting to set up a form for deductions from final paychecks. If somebody steals or takes more vacation than they have, can we deduct that. California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, North Carolina, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, Texas. Negative paid time off balances, and loss to the company, stolen money, equipment.	
1	We are restructuring our staff, bringing on 1 to 2 new positions, and changing staff compensation plans. The compensation package that we offer our outside sales person is going to change substantially. She would have the potential to make the receive the same or more compensation under the new plan, but it would require increased revenue generation on her part (more sales annually). We realize that she may decide to end her employment with us over this change in compensation package. (The job description is not changing in any substantial way so the position is not being eliminated rather it will be compensated in a different manner.) If she chooses to leave based on the change in compensation, is she eligible to apply for unemployment?	
1	We terminated an employee and lost the unemployment claim so now we are making sure An employee was counseled on the 30th regarding excessive absenteeism and tardiness. On Monday she said she would be late - I told her to take care of her vehicle and I understand. Today I got a text 30 minutes before she is to be here and she will be late today as well. In the warning that she signed it said she could have no further tardy for six months. Can we terminate? Will she have a successful unemployment claim?	
3	We have an employee that just offered their 30 days notice. They have been sworn into the Air Force as an officer. Does this change our ability to release immediately? Will we have to pay the resignation period?	
2	Are there any recent (last 24 months) severance agreement cases that provided favorable outcomes to employees with under 25 employees? Are severance agreements advised for groups that size if they have a clear employee handbook signed at hire? What states require severance?	
4	After 12 months we'll terminate an employee from benefits who has a workers' comp claim, we will also be terminating them as employee. How best should we communicate this to employees. Our lawyer and carriers have said that this policy is okay? .	
6	Final pay for California, must we pay on final date of employment or do we have 72 hours?	
4	It only is a docx. There is no link to the three forms listed.	
4	We have found one of our front desk employees has put a resume on the company computer. We have a policy that states employees may not use company equipment (including the computer) for anything other than business reasons. We want to terminate her.	
3	We do vacation/personal time as PTO all lumped together. Employees accrue time each pay period. If someone leaves and they have a negative balance, can I deducted those hours from the last paycheck. These are PTO hours we paid them for, but they had not accrued the time yet. ( essentially overpaid PTO)	
0	Calling on behalf of Pate Trucking Company: They are for profit in TX with almost 200 employees. A supervisor (employed since 2014) was out on surgery leave 5/4-5/29 unbeknownst to HR. He came back to work and worked for several weeks and the manager terminated him this past Friday for performance issues. There was no prior discipline. FMLA was not designated but he is exempt and they continued to pay him and the deductions continued. He came back to the exact same position. He is over age 40. We don't detail of the performance issues. He called and said he couldn't be terminated because FMLA was not designated. His supervisor is under age 40.	
5	Do you have a proprietary data form for exiting employees to sign? Currently have a non-disclosure/no-compete policy in place. Thanks very much, Mindy	
5	I checked our online enrollment system and it does not appear to specifically ask the employee to consent to the deductions. Can we still take them?

1	We let a receptionist go on Friday. We did not have a lot of work for her and she said she understood at the time. She has now come back and is saying we should have given her severance pay etc. She is asking that we give her a formal letter of dismissal.

0	We have a client that had employee access an HR document that included employee SSNs and salary information. The document had been accidentally saved to a shared drive and was not password protected. The employee that accessed the document then used the salary information to try and negotiate his salary. They want to know if this could be considered grounds for immediate dismissal and what is their PI obligation is to all other employees now that they know SSNs were accessed. Thanks!	
3	When calculating final pay for an employee and vacation. If the vacation is not earned until the employee has been here one year, are we required to pay it out if they leave prior to their year anniversary? What are the guidelines about providing employment references/verifications?	
1	An employee started in housekeeping last Monday. She has a terrible attitude and didn't show up for work Friday. Saturday she showed up and said she didn't know she was scheduled to work Friday. I met with her yesterday and wrote up a verbal warning. She got an accident (car) yesterday and said she was fine. She called in today and I told her we are terminating employment. She told me she was going to have to hire a lawyer because she is 3 months pregnant and ordered to work (we did not tell her that). She said one of her coworkers texted her saying you better come to work or you will lose her job. The employee denies the request. I told her to come in and get her check and she said she paid this other employee for the uniform, which that employee also denies. We did know she was pregnant. The employee was training her in the laundry. She is not a lead necessarily. She said she had to to go to the doctor. She has told people she is thinking about not keeping the baby and she has to go in for drug testing and somebody thought she went in for her required testing. She says no told her she was supposed to work on Friday. Should I rescind the termination?

1	We have a WA employee who did not participate in our active open enrollment, therefore, since no selections were made her benefits were canceled. She is now calling in sick repeatedly but claims she can not provide a doctors note since we canceled her coverage. Are we allowed to separate employment?	
3	Hello, What is either the best practice or federal guideline for giving someone time to consider a severance package. This isn't during a reduction in force, but more for when a high level executive isn't performing well and will be relieved of their duties but given a generous severance package. We want to be generous but also understand laws in giving someone time to consider the package presented. Is there a minimum amount of days we're supposed to give for someone to consider the package presented? Follow-up, what are some other "nice" things to give someone in a severance package besides $$? We've given people the use of a recruiter or outplacement services in the past. Candice Qualls	
1	Our client has an employee who filed a WC claim upon her return from a hunting vacation. It was brought to our attention that this same employee advised and instructed anther employee to file a WC claim. Additionally, her husband settled a large WC claim with his employer. Our client would like to terminate her employment as it seems that she may be creating a morale issue among the workforce.	
0	An employee was recently in the hospital for a non-work related illness. He left the hospital against medical advice and has not worked since his hospitalization. His supervisor subsequently advised him that in order to return to work he would need a doctor's note before returning. It's been two weeks since the employee spoke with his supervisor and he called today to request that he be laid off. He advised he feels he is not able to return to work because he does not believe he can do the physical labor associated with his job. He also stated that if he was laid off he would be eligible for medicaid which would cover his medical costs for his hospitalization and for future medical treatment. The supervisor suggested that he take a leave of absence and he replied that he needed to be laid off in order to be eligible for aid per a conversation he had with a nurse. Could you please recommend the best way for us to address this? Thank you

2	What is considered best practice/customary when offering a terminated EE severance for two months? Are wages paid in a lump sum amount at the onset of the severance period, including any commissions that would be due, auto stipend. etc.? Or is an EE paid semi-monthly, per our regular pay schedule, throughout the severance period? Do employers typically allow PTO to continue accruing during the severance period, and pay out the balance of unused/accrued PTO time at the end of the severance period (9/1/17) or at the time of termination? Lastly, do you have a template that could be used to summarize the agreement, and how benefits are to be addressed? We are considering delaying the first day of COBRA to 9/1/17, aligning with the end of the severance period. In the meantime, would the EE remain active in our payroll system, or terminated? Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

4	Our Michigan office has a few college students doing an internship and they are paid interns. Unfortunately, one of them seems not to be a good fit and HR is receiving many complaints from employees. Although we have not recorded any tardiness and poor performance of this intern and have not officially disciplined her yet, but employees wants her to go now. Can we end her internship immediately without giving any reasons? It's an internship relationship, not employment relationship from our point of view, but since we are paying her, I wonder from the legal point of view, the court regards it as an employment relationship if we are sued by her.

1	employee hired on 5/30 went into labor and gave birth to a child on 7/3. Here are the clients questions: 1) can they terminate her since she is not even working there for more than 2 months? They cannot afford to keep her position open for the six weeks she is entitled too under NY State DBL. 2) It there intention is to terminate her, what should they do in order to ensure they are on sold footing. 3) she is still in the benefit eligibility waiting period (1st of the month following 60 days) so she is not eligible for company provided medical benefits. 4) Is there a state law "FMLA style" in place that would obligate the employer to provide coverage?

0	We have an employee who is claiming that we are not allowed to deduct the loan amount from his final wages. Are his regular deductions considered part of the gross wages for the minimum wage purposes? His last paycheck was a net zero after all the deductions were taken out, could this be a problem? Could the employer be subject to waiting time penalties because his gross fell below minimum wage?	
0	We have an employee who request time off but his vacation request was not approved. He requested the time off through our online system, however, in addition to this his supervisor advised that unless he could get coverage for the time off requested, this was not approved. Even after reminders, he never followed up with his supervisor to confirm he got coverage, but then did not show up for work during the time off requested. We now consider this as being absent without approval, and consider it a no call no show. How should we notify the employee of this?	
0	Question about employee termination... We have an employee that has been out on workers comp for an extended amount of time, His restrictions were such that we could not provide modified duty. our works comp provider recently set him up to work in a return to work program that could accommodate his limitations. We have scheduled him to report 2 times now and he has not gone. The first time he just ignored it then said his daughter was visiting. The second time he claimed he was out of the state. We feel we have cause for termination for job abandonment but wanted to run it past you first. Thanks,

4	Hi - I received the following questions from a client and am hoping you can give guidance: "If we currently offer vacation and personal leave and we decide when an employee leaves that we do not want to pay that out can we do that as long as the employee manual states that or do we have to pay it out since they have accrued it? I know right now we do not pay out the personal leave and the handbook states that, but they are thinking about doing it for the vacation leave as well. Also if you can are you able to stipulate that they would not pay it out for salary employees, but will for hourly employees?" Thanks!

1	We have an employee who quit with no notice, she is wanting her PTO time that she accrued. In our handbook that employees sign off on, it states "You will be paid for all accrued and unused PTO when you leave the Company Unless you abandon your job.

3	We have a repayment agreement in place for employees who receive a sign on bonus or relocation, etc. as part of their offer letter. The terms basically state that if they leave the company within a year or are fired for cause, they will need to repay the amount. But how can we go about doing this? Can we withhold from someone's paycheck and how much? What recourse does the company have if the employee just refuses to pay the money? Some of these bonus amounts are quite large so it wouldn't be feasible to only be able to withhold from someone's paycheck.

So is there a way we can put in a policy that we will hold them responsible for giving us advance notice or we can hold some amount from them to cover the cost of the training we do with them. Eventually it is costing the company time n money and all the departments run into chaos.

1	I received an email from one of our employees notifying me that effective today, she is resigning because she does not feel safe in the workplace. Her supervisor, who is also her friend, made a comment about the employee's mental capacity. It is known that the employee has a mental disability. The comment made its way up to our company president and the president, with a female witness present, discussed the matter with the supervisor. The employee is now upset, we believe, because the company president is now involved. The employee stated that she was not offended by the comment that her supervisor made, and now feels uncomfortable continuing to work here. How should we respond? The supervisor is on suspension for a completely unrelated matter.
