Could you please advise? * In our specific case, our headquarters (where all of the I9 Forms are stored) is located in NJ. However, we have stores in several different towns/cities throughout NY, NJ, PA, GA, and MA. How do we go about correcting Section 1 errors on the I9 form? * With the same case in mind, different managers filled out Section 2 of the I9. Are we (HR) allowed to fix the errors that they made or do they have to do it? If they have to do it, how do we go about it? What if they are currently inactive? * We have a lot that have errors so we made a spreadsheet of each active employee with I9 errors. We have also heard that it is advised against to ask employees to redo the I9 form (due to discriminatory concerns that may arise) but it is allowed. If we are able to communicate well that we did an internal audit for every active employee and that it is not a discriminatory/targeting action, is it wise to take the action of asking the employees with errors to recomplete a new I9 form? * We understand that we have to attach an explanation to the I9s of terminated employees stating why the errors could not be fixed. Do we have to write out each specific error in the explanation? * We understand that we need to have I9 forms with handwritten signatures. If we have just a copy of the original I9, can we have the employee sign and date it on the page somewhere or do we need to redo the whole thing? * Should we photocopy their IDs and keep it with the I9?

Would like to discuss what can happen if we don't offer an extension and what happens with the person that we trained for his position? The employee is 72 years old. He wrote an email last year about retirement plans. The month he submitted his plan, we began grooming an internal replacement. Since he changed his mind and this person is ready to take his work - how do we handle this? He was the mentor of this employee. We already extended the termination date because the person was not ready - we asked him to stay for another 3 months and he agreed. And now he doesn't want to leave. We modified his work to appease him and make the transition flow smoother - he is part-time with vacation and sick benefits. We can put him on hourly part-time and pay him when he shows up. I am doing a proposal for him and he is the perfect fit for the program. He's been really sick lately. ***\n",

      "ADA rights vs feeling safe in your work environment We recently had an employee return to work after being in the hospital for 6 days. On his first night back, he became very weak and had to sit down in the back office, ultimately being sent home early to recover more. The manager on Duty was speaking to the employee about the incident as he sat regaining his strength and the employee mentioned that the reason he was weak was he hadn't slept for the past 4 nights since his doctor took him off of his pills. Later on the employee told others at the Front Desk, his department, \"that the pills they took him off of are the ones that make it so he doesn't hear the voices in his head.\" He has mentioned to Front Desk staff before about hearing voices. So...our question is at what point is it ok to request a doctor's note stating that the employee is ok to work without taking these particular pills? It is a slippery slope trying to ensure that all employees are safe, and feel safe, without infringing on the one employee's ADA rights. Any help, or insight, would be appreciated.

      "Hello. We have an employee who started working for us in August 2016. Since he was hired he's missed a substantial amount of work for various medical reasons. Each time we have gone through the ADA process and have decided to 'hold his job' for him due to the short duration of time off each time. This employee has missed an excessive amount of time since his hire date and we're really struggling to continue holding his job for him. But we have some concerns with terminating him. a) He's eligible for FMLA on 8/16/17........just a few weeks away. Are there any concerns to us terminating an employee so close to being eligible for FMLA? b) Anything we are overlooking before we terminate? Holding his job for all of this excessive amount of time is really costing us in terms of morale, extra work put on employees, and overtime costs. c) Has the fact that we've agreed to accommodate several times before now pose any concerns to us terminating now?

      "Good Morning, We have an employee working who has cancer. He has been employed at Bruce Howard Contracting for about 10 years. Sadly, the doctors have finally said there's really nothing else they can do for him. But, he is still working!!! He's a walking miracle- never complains and is still productive. We feel like his job has really kept him going and has truly helped him to not give up. We have had a hard time taking that from him. He really wants (begs) to work and shows real initiative! I hate even approaching this question, but I have to ask. What happens if this wonderful man, our employee passes while on the job site? Does this begin a worker's comp claim because he was on the job site? Are we at any risks as a business allowing him to work even if he would die of natural causes (kidney failure, heart failure, etc.)? He drives a company vehicle and does operate equipment. That being said, we cannot predict the future, but both wonder and worry, what if he fades away while on equipment? We always have a careful eye on him, but again as a business we are trying to evaluate all of our risks. We have really been trying to accommodate all of his wishes for continuing to work, but as we fear the worst, and start thinking about all of the real details if he were to pass, we are all starting to ask ourselves tough questions. What advice can you please give me?

Had another individual not walked by, he might have drowned. Our client that this employee is stationed at is concerned for the employees safety. They were advised he does have a seizure disorder and takes medication but \"forgot to\" that day. He was taken to the doctor and to a pharmacy to refill his medication. The work site supervisor would like to move the employee to a different position/crew as his current position has him working alone most of the time and they are fearful something might happen. If there is no change in pay, is this an acceptable practice? Should we send the employee a medical inquiry regarding an accommodation for his condition? He did pass out and had no recollection of passing out. We do not want the employee to suffer a seizure with no one around to help. I have some additional information I should probably include regarding this matter. The company that this employee works for is a staffing agency. The client he is placed with is the one concerned about having him work as a Crew Leader alone. The client company has no obligation to make any accommodations, or to keep the employee at all for any reason whatsoever. The client has suggested they place the employee in a different position, however, the pay and job would not be the same because he would not be working alone, and would need to be under another supervisor to make sure nothing happened to him. We are sending the physician a return to work evaluation to complete, but as a staffing agency, we are unsure what our requirements are under the ADA if that particular client will not keep him in his current position. We could offer him another position with another client, but the pay rates are set by the client, not us. This is a very tricky situation.

      "*** WAND Corporation HR question - incentive attendance program with FMLA team member Company: WAND Corporation Think HR Hotline: Questions: 1) Can we exclude \"John\" from being eligible in the \"SCURAP\" program? 2) If not, can we ask him to remove himself from the program? 3) If not, how would you recommend we handle the below situation. Details: Our 24/7/365 call center was having issues with unplanned absences. To combat this, we rolled out an incentive program that employees are eligible for if they do not have a an unplanned absence for the period. We have one employee \"John\" who is on intermittent FMLA. He has several unplanned absences throughout the period which are identified as FMLA absences. For the first period we ran this program, FMLA unplanned absences did not exclude John from the incentive program. However, for this 2nd period (Q4-2017) of this program, he has had many unplanned FMLA absences that have caused a burden on the other employees. When the individuals that are eligible for the incentive still are published, the manager is concerned it will be demoralizing for the other employees to see an employee with so many unplanned absences still receiving the incentive when the other employees have had to pick up his shifts. The manager sees John's inclusion in this program as rewarding the very behavior we are attempting to stop (with full understanding that there is a health issue here). This brings us to my questions above.

Thanks for your help. Gabriel Rein Director of Operations & Customer Success WAND - The Future of Restaurant Technology www.wandcorp.com gabriel.rein@wandcorp.com 952.279.2321 LinkedIn From: James Forrest Sent: Tuesday, August 8, 2017 10:05 AM To: WC WSC Group Subject: Introducing SCUARP Team, Unplanned absences hurt the team and we've all experienced the strain of the reduced capacity when people are out. In order to combat this we are starting the Support Center Unplanned Absence Reduction Program (\"skwarp\"). This program will allow us to reward those members of the team that don't have unplanned absences. For these purposes, unplanned absences are any unscheduled day off or leaving for the day after completing less than half of a scheduled shift. For those of you with absences covered by FMLA, those absences will not count against this program. So what is SCUARP? Simply put, it's a cash bounty split evenly between the team members without an unplanned absence in a defined period. Starting next quarter, each period will be a quarter in length with a bounty to be announced at the beginning of the quarter. To get this program running, though, we are setting an initial period as the remainder of this quarter (8/9/17 - 9/30/17) with a bounty of $500.00. At the beginning of each week, I will send an updated posting of the following split: SCUARP Bounty $500.00 Agent Last UPTO Split Abby Kallas $38.46 Andrew Frye $38.46 Chassy Tauberman $38.46 Joe Stine $38.46 Joe Vue $38.46 John Nelson $38.46 Michael Prior $38.46 Nathan Kirsch $38.46 Nishit Patel $38.46 Randy Danielson $38.46 Steven Eichler $38.46 Tanya Johnson $38.46 Travis Graham $38.46 If you have any questions or concerns or if you have a suggestion for a different name for the program (although Gabe and I are becoming fond of \"SCUARP\"), please let me know.

      "* Hi, What are the rules when hiring a permanent resident whose resident card is expiring in one month from date of hiring and they are awaiting to receive their US Citizenship appointment from immigration? ------------------------------ *Our Response:* There are limited circumstances in which the employee may continue working. If the individual's situation is not listed below, then the employee may not work until his EAD is extended or becomes a naturalized citizen. Below is information from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services department: *Automatic Extensions of Employment Authorization Documents (EAD) in Certain Circumstances* Automatic Extensions Based on Timely Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766) Renewal Application Foreign nationals in certain employment eligibility categories who file an EAD renewal application may receive automatic extensions of their expiring EAD for up to 180 days. The extension begins on the date the EAD expires and continues for up to 180 days unless the renewal application is denied. An automatic EAD extension depends on these requirements: 1. The employee must have timely filed an application to renew their EAD before it expires (except certain employees granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS)), and the application remains pending; 2. The eligibility category on the face of the EAD is the same eligibility category code on the Form I-797C,Notice of Action, the employee received from USCIS indicating USCISs receipt of their renewal application (except employees with TPS who may have a C19/A12 combination); and 3. The eligibility category is listed on uscis.gov as eligible for EAD automatic extensions. As of the date of publication of this M-274, Handbook for Employers, eligibility categories codes for a 180-day automatic extension are A03, A05, A07, A08, A10, C08, C09, C10, C16, C20, C22, C24, C31 and A12 or C19. The employees expired EAD in combination with the Form I-797C Notice of Action showing that the EAD renewal application was timely filed and showing the same qualifying eligibility category as that on the expired EAD is an acceptable document for Form I-9. This document combination is considered an unexpired Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766) under List A. ------------------------------ The USCIS has provided specific instructions on how to find the eligibility code on the employee's EAD: https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/form/m-274.pdf (PDF page 17 or document page 13) ------------------------------ Please note that the information provided herein is practical HR, not legal advice We'd appreciate your feedback.

      "holiday pay Hi! I received this suggestion from our manager in PHX, AZ. I am not familiar with this type of policy and would like to know if this is possible to consider in AZ - also in NYS. The teams are comprised of hourly, non-exempt employees. We recently implemented nine paid holidays for the AZ team and have had paid holidays in place for the NYS team - and have not had an attendance problem with them - however, the AZ team is another story. Thank you! We did this with one department previously, wanting to get your thoughts. If you have an unscheduled absence the day before or after a holiday you will not get paid for the holiday. Is that possible? This would allow us to approve an exact amount of people off for those days, knowing the likelihood of all the others showing would be high with that rule in place.

      "Attention: Rachel ADA and employment position Thanks Rachel - please review my answer FMLA does not apply as the employee in question started his employment in May and has not accumulated enough time to be eligible for FMLA. However, the ADA (American with Disabilities Act) may apply. The following are considerations: Employers' do not have to require a Physician's release but it is prudent to do so. However, this requirement will need to be applied to all employees with the same status. The ADA requires an interactive process between employee and employer to find a reasonable accommodation. The ADA allows that accommodation does not present the employer with undue Hardship. If there is undue Hardship - it needs to be substantiated. Moving to 1099 Status from W2 is not recommended. It is advisable to keep his status as a W2 employee and adjust hours if needed. If the employee is unable to full time - it is recommended that salary is pro-rated based on prior salary. An employee must earn a minimum of $455 a week to remain Exempt. Moving to an hourly position is also possible. From our discussion it sounds like you are pursing the right path at this time. It makes sense to require a Doctor's Release so you can help accommodate him. As stated it is not recommended he moves to 1099 status but rather is accommodated as a W2 employee. Susan R.

      "*** Topic: Paid Time Off Hi, my organization is exploring revisions to our PTO policy that will allow EEs maximum carryover hour to increase from 144 hours to 200 hours. Our policy is currently aligned with our Fiscal Year (Oct 1 - Sept 30) which means employees lose any hours over 144 on Oct 1. However, we are thinking about raising the carryover limit and extending the reset to Jan to allow more time for them to use their hours. Our main concern with this modification is that terminated employees will be entitled to accrued PTO hours if they leave the organization. Currently, we cash out accrual balances upon termination. At this time, our vacation and sick leave policies are combined, so if we raise the carryover limit and allow an extended period of time to use the hours, can we set a limit to the amount of PTO we are willing to cash out if an employee is laid off or voluntarily resigns? ***\n",

We allow employees to use vacation or sick time when they want time off for any reasons and we allow them to cash out either bucket of time once a year or at termination. We just give them each 1 week of sick time each January so they have it right away if needed, while they have to accrue the vacation time and the rate is based on seniority with us. Thanks!\n",

Employee has dependent coverage and typically share 50% of that premium. What option does the employer have to collect this premium during the leave? Or must wait under employee return? (As not sure if will come back..) 4. Person is scheduled out until December we think, so June to Dec, part of the time will be unpaid leave. Per above, when can Federal Cobra be triggered?

      "We have a team of EE's working in CA (San Jose). Salaried. Accrue 10 PTO days per year. An EE needs to leave 8/10 for a week in Minnesota. Just learned it's to care for a family member but not sure of the relationship. Because we provide 10 PTO days per year, I believe this covers the 3 days of paid sick leave that CA mandates. QUESTIONS: 1. Is this correct - or are the 3 days (accruing 1 hour for every 30 hours worked) in addition to the 10 PTO days we offer? I will confirm the relationship falls under the CA family member description. 1. I see there is a CA Kin Care law, allowing EE's to use half of their sick leave for care, treatment of EE or EE family member. Is this in addition to the CA Paid Leave? 2.

Here is what I was able to find online, but would prefer a guided answer for you. *Question: As a full-time student, am I exempt from federal income taxes?* *Answer:* Your status as a full-time student doesn't exempt you from federal income taxes. If you're a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident, the factors that determine whether you owe federal income taxes or must file a federal income tax return include: - The amount of your earned and unearned income - Whether you can be claimed as a dependent on another persons tax return - Your filing status, and - Your age If your income is below the amount of the filing requirement for your age, filing status, and dependency status, and no other filing requirements apply, you don't owe federal taxes on your income and you don't have to file a federal income tax return. Even if you're not required to file an income tax return, you may choose to file a return if you're entitled to a refund of withheld income tax or estimated tax, or you're eligible for a refundable credit.

      "*** We have an employee who we believe has a problem with alcohol. There have been both employee and customer complaints about her behavior and treatment of them. We have investigated and corroborated the complaints/stories we have heard. We had a conversation yesterday with the employee which was primarily performance based heres what were seeing conversation. She told us, during the course of the conversation, she admitted that in the past had an alcohol problem. She said she quit drinking last Thursday and that she would be able to handle it on her own, that she had the support of her daughter and her husband. Toward the end of the meeting, we told her to go home for the rest of the day and to think about how she wants to move forward. We let her know well work with her in any way she needs, time off for treatment, etc., but that when she comes in on Monday, we can talk again about her plan for work, time off if needed, and that any continuing behaviors that were not appropriate in the workplace would be subject to discipline for performance. We offered information about her insurance etc. We told her to let us know what she needs from us and if there is a plan for treatment where you need time off. She then said it was hot in here and she suddenly semi-passes out and became unresponsive. We had to call an ambulance as she had a medical emergency, it was almost like a seizure. The ambulance takes her away. We called her husband and he said she had been drinking a lot more than theyd admitted and that she had stopped cold turkey on Thursday. In the ambulance, she comes back to consciousness, and refuses treatment. After questioning by the EMTs, the ambulance eventually releases her. The employee returned to the office, and we then called her husband again and asked him to come pick her up. He did that. We told the employee that youve had a medical episode at work here and we need to know that youre okay and need to ensure that its safe for you to work, and we want to understand your restrictions. Now need a doctors note releasing her to return to work. Initially she said she didnt have a doctor. We printed out a doctors list from our insurance providers. She said her daughter was going to take her. Today she called and said she called a doctor shed seen some time in the past, the first appointment is Monday, April 24th. She asked me if I was going to keep her off work until that date. We need to know if its okay to keep her off work until that date? ***\n",

      "Medical restriction question Think HR Advisor, We have an employee that provided a doctors note last summer asking that we excuse the employee from warehouse work in the hot summer months due to heat intolerance. This employee is an office employee but is expected to work in a rotation to conduct warehouse audits on contract shipments. She has never indicated she has a disability and needs accommodations, but just has the heat intolerance so asking to be excused from this kind of work during the summer months. Her manager recently asked her to get an updated doctor's note since the note is from last year, but employee pushed back saying the note did not have an expiration date so assumed it would be good for the duration of her employment or at least the period she is expected to do the audit work in the warehouse. Is it reasonable for us to ask her to get an updated note every year or at least every other year to make sure we know the condition still exists and doctor signing off on it.

Eligibility: All active Full-Time Employees working 30 or more hours per week on a regularly scheduled basis Racine Area Manufacturers & Commerce, Inc. The group has regular Full Time employees and they have Full Time \"Contract\" employees. The Contract employees are paid through the groups payroll and their position is secure as long as they can receive a certain amount of grants and do a few other things that bring in money. So, with their position being full time and being paid through the regular payroll, the fact that they are \"Contract\" employees, and their position could potentially end at any point, is it okay that the group does not offer the LTD to them? Is it up to the group's discretion or is there a definite rule for this situation that the group can only do one or the other? Thank you\n",

      "Follow up question regarding wellness incentives: The weigh in for the incentive is related to the plan year ending on Sunday. I am questioning the ability of them being able to put the money into an HRA? I am also questioning if they provide the notice at the time of weigh in is that sufficient? They are using the data to make sure that they improved. We weigh at the beginning of the plan year and then at the end and if you improve you get the incentive in the next year. Notes from discussion: An employer wants to have a wellness incentive for those who participate and meet a certain outcome for reducing BMI/Weight? They want to provide the reward by way of a contribution into an HRA. Lets assume there is a group health plan that the HRA could be integrated with, is this a proper incentive? Any other concerns about HRAs and wellness? Next, lets say the employer measured at the beginning of the plan year, then again near the end of the plan year, can the HRA be applied to the following plan year? The employer wants to measure the improvement. If not allowed to apply to next plan year, what is appropriate way to retroactively reward those who were completed the assessment/improvement. Plan year ends 9/30. GINA notification requirements can you confirm that GINA notification requirements?\n",

      "One more question. If the child has a lapse in coverage because of a gap between when they lost Medicaid and when they enrolled in the employers plan, does this trigger a penalty under ACA?\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a new client and they offer an HRA. They fund the HRA based on if the employee meets their wellness requirement of having their routine physical. If the employee has a physical, they fund the second half of the deductible at $2,000 per individual and $6,000 per family. If the employee does not have their physical, they fund the HRA at a lower level of $1,500/$4,500. Based on the ACA wellness incentive allowance (employers may offer incentives of up to 30 percent of the cost of an individuals annual health premiums.) The individual employer funding level is less than a 30% difference between the wellness and non-wellness funding. The client initially wanted to provide no funding for ee's who did not receive a physical, and the prior broker advised against it because the HRA er contribution could not be greater than 30% of the non-wellness contribution. I dont know if this is definitely true since we are dealing with HRA dollars and not actual premium? Can you advise?\n",

If shes asking what is included in an employees annual salary, their current vol Life cert provides the definition as: Basic Annual Earnings means your annual gross earnings from the Employer during the calendar year just prior to the Determination Date. The \"Determination Date\" is the last day worked just prior to the loss. It is figured from the income box on your W-2 form, which reports wages, tips and other compensation from the Employer for federal income tax purposes. It includes your income before taxes and any deductions for pre-tax contributions to a Section 125 Plan, flexible spending account, Section 401K Plan or qualified deferred compensation plan. It does not include: 1. any Employer contributions to a deferred compensation plan; 2. income received from any car, housing or moving allowance; or 3. income from a source other than the Employer. It will not exceed the amount shown in the Employer's financial records or the amount for which premium has been paid; whichever is less. If you did not receive a W-2 form from the Employer prior to the Determination Date, it is figured by averaging the gross earnings received during the actual period of employment, as shown in the Employer's financial records.

      "Question; Mid year Change to benefit plans and HSA eligibility when an existing FSA election is already in place with a different Plan year Hi! Background information: Large group Employer currently offers 4 plan options- 3 are HMO options and 1 is an HSA option. The renewal date for the 3 HMO options and 1 HMO option is 4/1. Employer does not currently contribute to an employees HSA plan and they only have a couple of people taking the current HSA option. Employer also offers an FSA account with health reimbursement accounts and dependent care; the plan year for the FSA is Jan. 1st. Only 9 employees currently participate in the FSA health reimbursement accounts and those employees made an FSA election for the plan year beginning 1/1/2017. This employer was recently acquired by another company and the two companies benefit plans are being combined into one policy effective 8/1/2017. The new Medical policy is being written in the acquiring company's name and tax ID and lists the company being bought as affiliate company with common ownership. The acquiring company does not offer an FSA. The new benefit offering for 8/1 has 4 PPO plans of which 2 are HDHP/HSA options. They have done away totally with HMO options and Employer is now contributing to employee's HSA accounts effective 8/1/2017. Employees of both companies receive the same medical plan options, rates and employee contributions beginning 8/1. Question pertains to the 9 employees that currently participate in the FSA health reimbursement accounts. Question: Can these 9 employees elect the HDHP plan option for 8/1 and if so, are they eligible to contribute to an HSA account beginning 8/1/2017 or do they have to wait until 1/1/2017? Can they change to a limited purpose FSA mid -year? Does the situation described ( company being bought and new benefit plan in acquiring companies name) change any of the FSA election rules? Under what circumstances can one of these 9 employees that currently have an FSA health reimbursement account elect the HDHP and contribute to an HSA account and when? Please advise.

If an employee experiences a qualified life event, such as spousal loss of coverage due to termination of employment, and they wish to add their spouse to their current medical plan, is there any type of IRS regulation that indicates that the employer cannot administratively begin processing this before the event occurs? For example, if an employee's spouse loses coverage on 8/31, the employee would add their spouse to their plan effective 9/1. Can we as the employer collect the necessary documentation and have the employee process the event in our Benefits portal prior to 9/1, so long as the coverage is not effective until the actual date of the life event, which is 9/1?

Employer was advised that divorce or legal separation is considered a qualifying event to drop the spouse from the plan. Employee may request to drop her from the plan once he receives the divorce decree. It is also recommended to obtain a copy of the document for record purposes. Employer provided additional information: This situation is a bit more complicated than I thought. Employee and wife were married by common law marriage in Texas - they had cohabitated for over two years. Therefore, this divorce is one that doesn't necessarily require legal documents. So... in order for spouse to no longer have coverage since they are outside of the open enrollment period, do they need to obtain a legal documentation saying the common law marriage is over?

      "*** EMPLOYEE STD CLAIM: We've been dealing with an upcoming STD claim for our employee, Tony Kelly. Little background: he was an employee of ours who quit last August, worked for another employer for almost 2 months, and then came back. He now needs to have back surgery, scheduled for next week. The issue is that his claim is likely to be denied as a pre-existing condition (since he is new on the plan), disqualifying him from either STD or LTD coverage while he is off work. We have filed the claim and it is pending approval at this time. We are exploring ways we might be able to help him financially, if his claim is denied. Here are some of our thoughts -- we'd like your input on them: Issue 1: Investigate further with Sun-Life re: coverage. Tony says that he was covered by a Sun-Life STD policy during the short period that he left Acme to work for the other employer. Is there any way they would consider that continuous coverage even though it was through another employer (but the same carrier)? (However, he still had to complete the waiting period here before he got back on our plan, so even though he started on 10/3, his coverage did not re-start until 1/1/17. I don't suppose there is any way around that issue.) Personally, I doubt they will consider this continuous coverage. I'm sure they're trying to avoid paying claims, not looking for loopholes so that they CAN pay claims. Issue 2: Unemployment: One thought is to lay Tony off and so he could claim unemployment while he is off work. We would have to put him on COBRA, but G.R. would like to continue to pay for Acme's portion of the insurance coverage. Is there a way to do that with the third-party administrator? (Have the employee pay their portion and the company pay ours?) Issue 3: RE: the layoff ... I see some potential issues with doing this. He could later claim that we laid him off because of his medical issues (though I doubt he would), which could lead to other problems down the line, as well as setting a precedent. I don't know if we can or should get anything in writing explaining the situation. If he were to file an unemployment claim, do you have any knowledge of how this might affect our unemployment rate? Issue 4: If we do lay him off and he is off work for whatever period of time and then comes back to work, will he have to wait to be re-enrolled on insurance? Or if he's on COBRA, will he be able to get back on our regular insurance right away? ***\n",

After two surgeries and multiple sessions of physical therapy, he ultimately received a settlement from the Workman Comp Commission in Illinois. He re-injured the back in 2015. This has now been diagnosed has degenerative disc disease; after several different treatments were tried without success, treatment was halted after a second medical opinion from the insurance carriers decision. This case is still open with the Workman Comp Commission. He re-injured the back in 2016 with essentially the same result including the second medical opinion; this case is still open with the Workman Comp Commission. Once again a couple of months ago he complained of back pain; I m not sure that any medical treatment has been rendered due to the reluctance to the carrier to pay for more treatment. In between these almost annual back pain issues he seems to be fine and is able to work with a 20# weight restriction. Starting later this month we will be on our fourth workman comp carrier since 2011 primarily due to this one employee.

      "Appian - QLE Question Good Morning, We have a client in Northern VA with about 600 employees that has a question on a possible life event. We really don't have all of the details but our understanding is that his COBRA coverage (through his wife's previous employer) was terminated as of 5/30, but he did not realize it was terminated until recently. He reached out to his employer (our client) to see if he could come onto their plan. Here is the email we received from the client: Rob & his family were on his wife's ex-employers COBRA coverage from May 1 - now (so he thought). He realized that the healthcare payer (discovery benefits) was not paying the carrier (BCBS) for his son's doctor visits from May 31 - present, and now he wants to put his family on Appian's insurance instead of trying to reinstate his wife's COBRA coverage. We've provided Health Advocate to him as a resource and I called them myself to get an idea if they could help him with this issue and they said they definitely could help with reinstating cobra - especially if his wife's ex-employer uses health advocate it would be easier. I even started a case for him and provided the case # to Rob to make the process easier when he called. He has not called (as far as we know) and we would like to discuss the implications to Appian IF we did allow him to go on our coverage. We definitely want him to call HA first before making any exceptions to the 30-day window. The group is self-funded and renewed their plan on 6/1/17 so they are outside of their OE window, but they wanted to know if there was a way to allow him to come onto their plan or if there would be any potential risk in them allowing him to come onto their plan. We did find information that tells us a willful failure to properly administer the qualifying life event rules by a plan administrator could result in the IRS revoking the tax-favored status of a Sec. 125 plan. This would mean that all employer and employee contributions would be subject to Federal taxes. The application of this rule could be retroactive to the original effective date of the plan. We also reviewed the Summary Plan Description. The plan document clearly states that all status changes must be made within 31 days of the qualifying event. Failure to administer the plan by the provisions in the SPD could open Appian up to ERISA penalties as well. We don't see how we can recommend anything other than the request to join the plan should be denied and all efforts should be directed toward having the COBRA reinstated or purchasing an individual benefit plan. We also verify that an individual has a 60-day window from the date they lose coverage to enroll in the Federal Marketplace. Do you have any supporting documentation that we could send along to our client? Or any additional information you could offer on this would be great!\n",

      "*** Back in September, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had a complete hysterectomy. After additional testing after the surgery, they cleared her and said they did not find additional cancer, so she did not have to follow up with radiation or chemotherapy. In January, she started feeling sick like she had the flu. She worked through the 13th of January. Starting on the 16th, she was out sick. She was out that whole week. At the end of the week, she was in the hospital and was told that she had liver cancer, but on Monday, the 23rd, her general practicioner said that she did not have cancer, but had not seen the results of the biopsy. She came to work on Wednesday the 25th, but really was not productive, did not feel well, had her head on the desk at points. At the end of the week, she found out that it was in fact cancer that had traveled to her liver. She was scheduled for additional testing and prepping for her first chemo treatment on Friday, February 3rd. Throughout this whole time, she has not been able to eat/drink or keep anything down, which led her back to the hospital where she is now. I spoke with her husband yesterday. He said that since she currently has insurance, that Medicare may start March 1st. I am not sure if this is definitive, so my question would be...do we need to put her on cobra? And can we pay for her cobra? How will this affect her with her treatment schedule or with applying for Medicare? She has had enough vacation and sick leave to carry her through January and to February 1st. He also mentioned that they may wait until July to file for social security since she will turn 66 then (her birthdate is 7/19/51). But, should she file now? How will this affect her LTD with us?

      "*** ThinkHR Sales Michael Kirk, M (847) 650 1493. Email trail from client. My big question is regarding the ALE - I am to base this from 2015 calendar year correct? This hits 2 school years for us. I know you said they are full time if they average 30 hours per week. What if in one school year they do not meet that and in the next they do meet that. How do you do the calculations? Also what about Spring break, christmas break? Teachers are not required to work those days so would that drop them to part time for the month. There are my questions: The employees with numbers (percentage) behind their last name is an estimate of hours based on a 40 hour week. So a 50% employee I put 20 hours. Am I Ok to do that? I would never be able to track their actual hours. I have highlighted the summer months of June and August for Full time employees. The teachers still work a week in June and about 2 weeks in August. Do I need to put hours in there for those weeks? Jon Teune also does seasonal hourly work in cleaning the school over the summer (I have highlighted those hours in blue. Do I need to do something different with those hours. Is any of the above questions going to matter if we fall into only 40 FT or FTE employees on average for 2015? My main question is the summer months. The FT teachers do work a week in June and 2 weeks in August. Will it make us fall into the Large Employer or will it not make a difference seeing we are at 40 FT or FTE without it. The question I believe we are looking at is whether or not Dutton is a large employer and subject to the ACA requirements. Response # 1 to client. The formula for this is fairly simple. For each calendar month, determine the number of full time employees. Full time employees are any employees that average 30 or more hours for that calendar month. Each full time employee counts as 1 FTE. Next, take the total number of hours for all of the employees that were part time for the month and divide those hours by 120. This will give you your part time employees FTE. Add the 2 together. Should look something like this: January 25 Full-Time 674 Part-Time Hours /120 = 5.6 FTE 25 + 5.6 = 30.6 FTE for Jan. Next average for the calendar year. If the number is above 50 for 2015, then you need to report. Response #2 to client When attempting to determine full time equivalent (FTE) status of teachers and faculty, regulations differentiate between faculty on paid and unpaid leave during the break. Paid Leave If the faculty member is on paid leave during the break, then the institution must follow the hours of service rule. Hours of service include hours for which the employee is paid even if the employee is not actually working. Unpaid Leave If the faculty member is on unpaid leave during the break, the institution may use one of two methods to calculate the employees hours. The institution could simply disregard the employment break and use the actual hours of service averaged over the academic school year. The institution could credit the employee with average hours of service during the employment break equal to the average weekly rate during the rest of the academic school year. This Christian school is really close to being an ALE. This is a pretty simple exercise until you get to the summer months of June, July and August. The school was asking me how to handle salaried employees that dont work but are paid throughout the summer. Also, they were asking how to handle employees of theirs that are paid by a public school (employees in row 72-79 in the SS). ***\n",

      "Generally when an employee is enrolled in Medical and their hours are significantly reduced (under the minimum hours required by the carrier for eligibility) they are charged the full months premium cost (without employer contribution). When this occurs we notify the employee that should they return to the minim hours required for medical eligibility we will reimburse them the employer contribution for the month should the increase occur within that month. This has proven to be a little tricky we are an IT Consulting agency, our employees are only paid for HRs work and the required NYC PSL and thus at time some employees will take a week off without pay and are enrolled in Medical.

For example an employee works all possible weeks in the month except one, reducing their hours for that one week below the required 30 but return to the normal hours after.\n",

Or, as my move to Virginia is a qualifying event, couldn't I switch now, this month of April, out of Kaiser and into Anthem HMO and then enroll on May 1 with COBRA coverage through Anthem going forward? I am confused about the statement, \"since TLC does not offer a PPO...\" - could you explain what you mean by that? Isn't Kaiser an HMO plan?

She offer her an additional case for FMLA which she declined. We are trying to figure out how to discipline her. We were thinking of on call, then if she comes in the first day of the week, we offer hours for the next week and if she calls for a non-FMLA reason we do not schedule her for the rest of the week. Can we do that? She declined to go to the doctor because it costs too much. She is a regular full-time employee and she is missing more work than the FMLA certification provides for. Since May, we offered FMLA paperwork and she has missed 10 days that were call ins unscheduled absences that does not include time she requested ahead of time. She doesn't use her FMLA. It started in November 2016 and she still has 292.5 hours left. She writes diarrhea, stomach cramps, migraines (that's a big one). Her FMLA states twice a year appointments, lifetime, heart fibrillation. 48 hours for each absence flare up. She tends to miss days around her day off. Can I date the Designation Notice that she is NOT eligible for FMLA? I spoke to her yesterday and noted that we've talked to her several times. Reminder her we offered the FMLA and she declined it. I told her it was bad for morale. She's good when she's here. We just can't depend on her to be here.

      "I have a client who currently has an employee enrolled in FSA Health Care. She is on FMLA until Tuesday, 08/22/2017. She is required to send a payment once or twice a month to us to keep her benefits going. Can you let me know if there would be any ramification if the company puts her FSA account on hold and or terminate?Our Response: We do not provide tax or legal advice to clients. In general, we note: The FMLA requires that an employee taking FMLA leave be permitted to continue coverage under a health FSA while on FMLA leave or revoke an existing FSA election under the cafeteria plan for the remainder of the coverage period. If election is made to continue coverage during the leave, benefit payments can be maintained as follows: 1. Prepaid prior to leave on a pre-tax (or post-tax) basis; 2. Paid as due during leave on a post-tax basis (typically by check written to employer); or 3. Reimbursed after return from leave, either on a pre-tax or post-tax basis. It is important to note that pre-tax payments are not allowed to span flex plan years, and therefore pre-tax contributions must be linked to benefits provided in the same plan year. If coverage is maintained under a written agreement, expenses incurred during leave are eligible. If the employee revokes the health FSA, expenses incurred during the leave of absence are not eligible for reimbursement. Upon return from leave, the employee may resume his or her original per-paycheck deduction (thereby decreasing the annual election by the amount of the missed contributions) or increase his or her per-paycheck deduction to meet the annual FSA election. There are no limits on the amortization, and this amount needs to be authorized in writing by the employee. Reference: https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.125-3 We recommend reviewing plan materials for clarification against the obligations of an employer under the FMLA.

      "*** A gentleman has been with our company for some years. He has been on continuous FMLA STD for the last 2-3 years - situations where there was nothing ultimately wrong with him. He fakes passing out - eventually he quit doing that. We hired someone to take his place because FMLA exhausted. We verbally warned him and he has been written up for it. 4 months ago we hired someone to train and for the last 3 months he did ok. He is over his hours (40 hours in 90 days). He was well over the 40 hours and we would have let him go. Today he shows up barely able to walk and he wants to take a leave until after the 4th of July. He went to a foot doctor and they couldn't do anything. He came back with a note from his regular doctor today simply stating he was seen. We explained we cannot just give him a leave. He can get FMLA or STD. We told him the only way he could be out is FMLA and we are going to fire him. He went back to his doctor (I gave him his FMLA form) and the doctor gave him a note with the exact amount of time he wants to be off. Its not a FMLA paper - it simply says probable duration of condition 2 weeks. It says he can't state and we don't know why. At the bottom they wrote he is going to be out 1 time every 3 months for about 3 months because that is when he has a flare up. They stamp[ed it on the front. I told him this is not a FMLA paper. I asked him when his Ortho appointment was. As soon as one runs out he gets another FMLA. He's over his hours. If you come in with a note, we know you're sick, it says whats wrong with you. In the past he said he had a gun and was going to shoot everybody in here when he got mad because he couldn't be out again - his FMLA ran out. I don't know if he is eligible for FMLA. What does he need to be eligible? If he is not FMLA eligible, what happens if we fire him? I'm the one who suggest the FMLA, because he was over his hours. ***\n",

After two days or so, the supervisor reached out to the EE and received a text message back that he is in the VA hospital. That is all the information that we have right now. The ADA is murky waters at times and I am wondering how long we need to hold his position or if we should (or could) consider moving him back to his previous position that is less stress and would allow him greater freedom to take days off by getting shifts covered, etc. What documentation should we require or produce on our part as the employer?

      "*** QUESTION Hello, We have a Federal Cobra group, in Philadelphia, PA, with the following question: We have an employee we would like to hire. Her immediate supervisor, Rudy, asked her to come in and fill out paperwork and provide her documents for the I-9. She filled out all documents and listed her name as GENA BELL and when I looked at her copy of her documents, she had her SS card listed as GENA BELL and her PA Driver's License listed as GINA BELL. I asked Rudy to find out why the discrepancy and to please find out if she had a passport or any other document listed in column A on the I-9 to prove her correct name. She stated that GINA on her license was an error that she never got corrected, and she does not have a passport. She stated she does have her voter registration card, which is listed under column B on the I-9, and she will bring it in tomorrow to provide her 2nd requirement for the I-9 for GENA BELL. She also said she was going to go to the DMV and attempt to get her spelling of her name corrected. If she comes in tomorrow with the voter registration spelled GENA BELL does that fulfill her I-9 requirements since I already have a copy of her SS card? (that would be both B & C documents). In addition to that, should we ask for a copy of her PA License once she gets it corrected to GENA BELL? (I'm not even sure if we are legally allowed to do that?) Also, as we discussed, she has worked for large companies in the past (Marriot, Sheraton, etc.) and stated she never had a problem with this before. Is there anything else we should/shouldn't do in this unique situation? I await your reply. Thanks! Best regards, Lisa L.

We are a publishing company and we generally buy manuscripts from former teachers and publish them. We do have contractors with those people and the contracts says that they are signing all rights to the books over to us. We handle copyright issues, we can resell for royalties, etc. The EDD auditor is leaning towards classifying those people like employees and we have never treated them that way and we have paid them through A/P on a 1099 basis. Additionally, in many cases we are not their sole source of income, they write books for other people. The auditor seems to think there is an industry specific guidance that makes these individuals more likely to be employees because they have given away the rights to their content.

What is the best way to recover our property? He took an advance of $900-plus and his final wages was only $600. He still owes $2500 on tools he bought on the company credit card. In addition, he took without us knowing, his truck's tools and inventory. He was terminated for reasons no connected with this. He pulled a GPS out of a van and destroyed it in the process, which was the reason for termination. He's been very aggressive - screaming in the office. He requested a week off and he left anyways. On his way home, he took the truck apart and ripped up the GPS and threw it away. We called him and asked for the truck so we could fix the GPS. We picked up the truck and this is how we were notified the GPS was destroyed intentionally. He gave back the keys and the ladders. We found the truck was stripped when we opened the truck $6,000. The repayment for the tool account is $30 every check and there is a written agreement and the last check is supposed to be held in full if something is missing. I know we have to pay the minimum wage. Advances are separate. The advance for wages is in a written policy. They ask for advances almost every week. We have written policies. An attorney reviewed our policies after an EEOC claim said our practices are legal. He was notified by another employee that we realized everything was gone, which is a felony charge. He texted Daron that he has the stuff and needs to return it. How do we proceed - we can send him a list of everything he has or send two people to go there and take the stuff. Or, make the exchange and have something for him to sign that \"we're cool.\" He is African American and has thrown around the word \"discrimination.\" It's unlikely he would be violent.

Is there a minimum amount of days we're supposed to give for someone to consider the package presented? Follow-up, what are some other \"nice\" things to give someone in a severance package besides $$? We've given people the use of a recruiter or outplacement services in the past. Candice Qualls\n",

      "*** Hello, We have a situation that Id like some guidance on: Our receptionist has been feeling stressed about work and life issues. In high emotion on 1/14/17 she said she was packing her desk and quitting. Our General Manager encouraged her to take a week of personal time to decide if she wanted to stay and work things out, or if she really wanted to quit. She did take her personal items with her that day. While she was gone, the Club functioned better than usual, without the emotion and stress that her presence created. We hoped she would decide to quit, but planned to terminate her otherwise. We called her today before she reported for her return shift and she informed us that she did indeed decide to retire. She intended to come in to work out her notice, but we told her that we think it is best to end things immediately and we would pay her for the two weeks in lieu of her coming in. We have not done this before, so I have the following questions: Do we pay her a gross ***\n",

I am not physically there so my attending will be a tip off. I am worried she will start videotaping and that it will be a full blown scene. I am worried about the other employees more than her at this point. I want to minimize the impact on our small staff. We have 3 reporters, one of whom is being terminated. The other reporters feel like she is being treated unfairly. Many days she does not come in until 12 (after PT). Should the manager set the meeting? How do we get the lap top?

My question is, should we be paying out all of their vacation time remaining for the year or should we only pay out the amount they would have accrued up to their termination date? We would like to know what State Law(MA) and Federal law states. Here is an example: Employee terminated on 3/24. Payroll occurred on 3/31.

We do give our employees access to all of their vacation time on 1/1 of that year and do not allow it to roll over.

      "ThinkHR Team, Please review the question posed by my client, Level 5, LLC below highlighted in yellow. We appreciate your thoughts and comments with regards to the GA DOL regs and state law. Per our discussion, heres the email from Brad that he wanted to propose to the owners. Could you please verify that we are in compliance with any Georgia Department of Labor regulations pertaining to vacation payout and termination/resignation concerns. Thank you for your assistance. I am considering a revision to the vacation policy. I will need to submit the policy to the partners for approval. The proposal: 1. Two weeks vacation - new hires earn vacation hours out of the gate but must work 6 months to get the benefit of vacation. 2. After 4 years the employee begins earning an additional week so that they have 3 weeks vacation in year 5. 3. After 8 years the employee begins earning an additional week so that they earn 4 weeks vacation in year 9. 4. Carry over: * It is our intent that our employees utilize vacation not save it up. * Two weeks is the maximum carry over * Upon Resignation or termination, vacation paid to employees is a maximum of 4 weeks. I want to make sure that they approach above does not materially differ from our current policy in terms of resignation or termination. I also want to make sure that it is legal, meaning they have 6 weeks carried over if the employee has been with the company longer than 8 years but we are only paying 4 weeks.\n",

Are wages paid in a lump sum amount at the onset of the severance period, including any commissions that would be due, auto stipend. etc.? Or is an EE paid semi-monthly, per our regular pay schedule, throughout the severance period? Do employers typically allow PTO to continue accruing during the severance period, and pay out the balance of unused/accrued PTO time at the end of the severance period (9/1/17) or at the time of termination? Lastly, do you have a template that could be used to summarize the agreement, and how benefits are to be addressed? We are considering delaying the first day of COBRA to 9/1/17, aligning with the end of the severance period. In the meantime, would the EE remain active in our payroll system, or terminated?

I know right now we do not pay out the personal leave and the handbook states that, but they are thinking about doing it for the vacation leave as well. Also if you can are you able to stipulate that they would not pay it out for salary employees, but will for hourly employees?\" Thanks!\n",
