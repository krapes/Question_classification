cluster	question	
8	We would like to hire receptionist for us for a couple of days, who is the daughter of an employee/friend. The daughter is age 14. Is that allowable?	
8	We have some managers who are posting jobs and putting on their job descriptions that candidates must be fluent in Cantonese/Mandarin. The workers in that department speak English, Cantonese, and Mandarin, the client base primarily speaks English and the primary language of the company is English. Is that legal? (Issue 4)	
8	Please advise about the minimum paperwork/forms that would need to be included in personnel file of a person who is being hired as a temporary employee to assist with office tasks. This person would be part-time and will not have benefits. I'm trying to verify what both the state of Tennessee and the Federal government would require to be in their file. Thanks.	
3	We currently do not do background checks, but we are considering implementing them. Can we set a hard and fast rule that candidates can have no felonies whatsoever to pass the background process?	
4	It is my understanding that California signed into law a state wide Ban the Box on July 1st. I need to know if I can still ask if someone has been convicted of a crime of our applications?	
5	Relocation package advice - renters v non-renters. Should we use a relo company?	
4	We have on our online application the question whether someone requires sponsorship. Often times the candidates do not understand this questions, is it okay to ask them more about it and if they say that they require sponsorship, can we stop the interview and tell them that the company does not provide sponsorship?	
8	A client has always posted for open positions. However; they want to be able to move someone into a role who is qualified rather than post in general just to go through the motions. For example...an IT position is open and a current employee in the department is qualified. Knowing no one else in the organization is qualified they would like to move on the change. What is your advice on a company policy regarding position postings that incorporate leadership decisions outside of a posting?	
6	We have hired a couple of interns who are going to be working at our company through a program sponsored by the city of Glendale.we have been advised that the city will be paid these intern's salaries and expenses. Would we need to have them complete a Form I-9 and W-4?

7	An employee has worked for about a week and on an application he turned in and has not filled out the I-9. He filled it out but does not have proper identification. We have asked for items and he cannot provide them. He does have the list with him. What if he comes back and fills out a new application with identification - can we rehire him?	
6	Good afternoon, Our camp counselors are seasonal employees and are on our Payroll and considered employees of the City. Is there a requirement that they should have a pre-employment physical and drug screen? We do physicals and drug screens for our other seasonal employees. I am assuming best practice is to conduct these, but want to see if there are any laws pertaining to this. Thanks so much, Lisa	
7	We have a client that would like to offer a recent university graduate employment. However, he will only be able to work for them for a year under his F1 Student Visa.

Where would the client be able to obtain information on how to apply and manage this sponsorship in accordance with the law.	
3	When we issue a candidate a preliminary adverse action letter based upon background check results, how long do we have to give him to respond before taking final action?	
4	Can you research if a candidate has litigation history against employers?	
8	Matt (broker) calling on behalf of Trudi. There was a hiring fair and it was only open to those who received an invitation. Someone came who was not invited to the event. The company has history with this person and they had concern with them being there. Do they have to consider their application?	
4	Is it illegal on an original application? Sometimes a supervisor will write a note on the application?	
7	I have a gentleman that started today and he spells his name Geovany and also Jovany and his passport and his ID are both Jov spelling but he goes by the spelling of Geo. When he filled out his HRIS profiles, he used the Geo. He signed his I-9 Jov. In our HRIS, does it matter Geo? Both spellings are connected to his SSN because of his background check. He says his mother and father spelled it different ways.	
1	Candidate for position and was requested to come in to discuss the position and an offer. She cancelled two meetings via email. The last cancellation I asked her to call me directly to discuss. I asked why she was cancelling again and she stated she had morning sickness. I am concern about her cancelling the appointments and now concerned she is pregnant and may not be able to work in the required area. There are some drugs/chemicals she should not be exposed to during pregnancy. What are risk if I don't move forward with an offer? 415-946-6487	
7	While I was on leave, a manager hired a individual who is wheelchair bound to be a nurse. I am concerned for his safety and others. I don't understand how he can do the functions of the job. The lifting requirements alone are a concern. He hasn't started yet. i don't think I can withdraw the offer but what can I do? Do I need to change the job description going forward for other which mirrors his restrictions?	
8	question Question when we schedule an interview and the candidate comes to the interview is there any laws or regulations that would prevent us from not even starting the interview and saying this isnt going to work etc. or within minutes of starting the interview they pick up their cell phone and looking at it why the interview is going on, can we end it right there and tell them why we are ending it? On rejection letters/e-mails can we offer constructive criticism with why they didnt get the position?

3	Hello! Should I be stating the fact that we do background checks and pre employment drug screens in the actual job posting or does that come later with a job offer that is contingent of passing both?

2	What are the state reporting requirements for SC and IL? SC total employees: 40 IL total employees: 19	
8	We received the results of a background check report that had a charge of theft for a candidate applying for an HR position. This is job related as she will have access to confidential employee data including SS numbers and credit card info used for expense reporting. Can we discuss the use of the pre adverse action notice and the adverse action notice. The information appears to match her info, with the exception of the date of birth reported by one of the courts.	
1	Hello, We are looking to hire someone to fill a position but the candidate that we are interested in has a wrist injury.The candidate, in the interview mentioned she hurt her wrist on her previous job and that is why she stopped working for them. She was a perfect candidate for what we are looking for however, we are hesitant to hire her because of her preexisting injury. I don't believe we are allowed to ask her if she filed workers comp or disability. We are not sure how to proceed.	
6	We require pre-employment physicals for our regular employees. We use many temp employees through a staffing firm. Should we require the same for them? It is high turnover and is expensive to conduct all of the pre-employment physicals for someone who stays such a short period of time.	
8	I have a question regarding the "Ban the Box" initiative in New York State. Relating to the cities of Rochester, Buffalo, and Syracuse. All if the information I am seeing shows that the only illegal action relating to this initiative is discrimination based on the "box". My question is can we have the box on applications if the candidates are completing the applications during the interview visit process (in-person), or do we need to remove this?	
2	HRWatchdog has posted a new item, 'Back from the Holiday? Dont Forget About New Domestic Violence Notice' If you have 25 or more employees, you now must provide new employees with a written notice about the rights of victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking to take protected time off for medical treatment or legal proceedings. The notice also contains information on victims rights to accommodation and protections against discrimination. We were informed of this notice requirement. Is there a pamphlet or handout we can use for this notice to our new hires?

2	Our whole company has 89 employees and we are all salaried exempt. When the new regulations were pending we decided to convert some roles to salaried non-exempt. I am drafting a new offer letter and the template says exempt but I'm wondering if there is information I should include specific to non-exempt employees.	
6	We are a lab in CA. We have employees all over the country, called field techs in many states. One of our couriers who we pay $40 to drop the samples off to the local FedEx station we just found out are paying someone else under the table $20 to courier packages to the fed ex station one time per day. This drop off happens one time per say and only takes about 15 minutes. We want to cut out the courier and work directly with the people who are making the drop offs. (They work for another company and just take our samples to the FedEx station.) One of us thinks we need to onboard them as employees and pay for the time worked and another thinks we would pay them as independent contractors. Can we bring them on as independent contractors?	
8	Hello, Some of our prospective employees are required to get cleared by our insurance company if they are going to be driving a company vehicle. We have a prospective employee that has the maximum number of points and accidents on their license (all within the past 3 years) that our insurance company allows for them to be insured to drive our vehicles. The hiring manager would like to rescind the employment offer on a basis of not passing our background checks, because one more accident or traffic violation would render her not able to do her job. Could you provide some guidance as to whether this is acceptable to do? Thank you!	
4	Can we ask about conviction history in DC for volunteers?	
5	When is the best time to do the reference checks for applicants.	
6	We are going to implement an online applicant tracking system. We are federal contractors required to use E-Verify. The ATS system that we are installing does not provide an option to include the E-Verify poster with the online app. We currently include the poster with all hard copy apps. Could we include a link to the E-Verify poster on our Careers page?	
6	Beth, Thanks for your quick response! Just one clarification, I dont think my question was understood correctly. Here is my question: In next week or the near future, we need some extra help to stuff envelopes and are thinking of bringing in some students/kids to help us. We are thinking they would work 6-8 hours maximum. Do we have to pay them through our payroll as an employee or can we pay them as independent contractors? We will pay them for sure, we are not sure if we should pay them as independent contractors or as temporary employees. Would you please re-answer my question? I am sorry for the confusion. Denise Hong Secretary-Treasurer	
7	We had an employee who resided in Canada resign from our Agency several years ago He is interested in returning and he still resides in Canada. Several years ago we had to prepare a letter for the TN Visa and he would have a copy to present at the border coming and going. I believe I would have to prepare another letter addressed to Homeland Security for him to take across the boarder requesting a TN VISA pertaining to NAFTA agreement. There have been changes with the new US President in office and I am wondering if there were any changes that I should be aware of now.

4	I'm revising our application CA, TX, GA, IL, Mass, and NY we have three different entities.

8	My CEO/COO are getting ready to offer a job to a senior level staff member. They'd like this person to begin work with us on 7/31. The candidate has expressed that he will be taking his son to college for a set number of days in August (4 working days at the most) and would like us to consider it not counting towards his PTO. My COO is fine with this and has suggested that we build it into his offer letter that for a set period of time he would be off, and we would not track it as PTO. My hunch is that this is fine as it's up the the employer whether or not this leave should be counted. But I wanted some feedback from someone here to affirm my hunch. I know this would somewhat set a precedent, but I also know this arrangement would stay between a select number of us. Would there be any reason why we couldn't do this? Any laws around time off that say we couldn't make this special circumstance available to this new hire? Do we need to count this requested leave as PTO within the eyes of employment law?

4	There is a new law in California "LA Bans the Box. Under this ordinance, private employers with at least 10 employees will be barred from inquiring about a job applicant's criminal history during the application process. Does this mean we have to take that section out of our company;s employment application? Our company does not require employees to fill out an application until they are hired. Do we still need to take that section out of our application even though it is AFTER they are hired?

Do you by chance have a best practice process flow that can be shared with us? Thank you!

7	We had run a polygraph test on an employee before placing him at a particular client site which requires no negative results. Due to the results we were not able to place him at that site. Our expectation initially was that if we couldn't place him there, we'd place him elsewhere. He's been asking about this. We have another client, a school but I'm struggling with this morale issue. I feel we should not place him at the school given his admittance and would like to know if I can discuss this situation with the employee directly. Can you confirm that I cannot use results of a polygraph to make an employment decision? He admitted to relationships with underage girls and we also found deception on other questions. His position would be security officer. We are hiring him for the state of Virginia.

2	Quick question about the frequency for New-Hire Reporting per state (for example in California, https://thinkhrcomply.com/ReferenceHome/Staffing/NewHireReporting/CaliforniaNewHireReporting) does it have to be within 20 days after each new hire, or can a report be provided in batches for all hires within a period?

Thanks for clarifying the required frequency.

7	We have an active employee who is applying for work in another department. The hiring manager is planning on offering $36K however, this employee is currently making $42K. He says why should he make an internal transfer/hire and pay someone beyond $36K when he can otherwise hire externally and train them.

3	any best practices for background check non-negotiables for food manufacturing/retail industry? i.e. how far back should we look into criminal history for hourly team members. what offenses should we allow/not allow, any benchmark data for our industry?

5	A company just hired an employee for a temporary position. When completing the W-4, the employee advised he did not know his social security number. What is the employer's responsibility here? How can they process payroll without a social security number?	
4	I understand we should no longer be asking for criminal history on an application. However, if an offer is ACCEPTED can we then put a question in their background check consent through our background check vendor asking for criminal history (dates, conviction, details, etc.) and also ask for salary history? What I'm really looking for are those who lie or omit information. Since we can't ask this in an application any longer, I want to make sure we can ask it when most lawful. Also, after an offer is accepted, some candidates don't want their current employer contacted via background check co. so I ask for a W2, check stub, or offer letter to verify current employment. Is this still ok since an offer was accepted?

6	We are a non profit where we engage unpaid volunteers to help out. Are there any concerns I should look out for?

2	Q2: List of documents for NJ and CA new hire paperwork	
7	I have an applicant who resides in VA that we did a background check on for pre-employment. His credit report is not acceptable to us. He was a very borderline candidate for us and we were on the fence and he is behind on his credit and his total debt is very high (over 2 million) and our position does not pay him a salary that could accommodate this. Since he is behind on current mortgage and the amount of out flow he has we just feel he would only take our position short term until he found something paying him more and we just dont feel overall he is responsible. We have been burned on this before with a previous employee that we offered a job with unacceptable credit for us and in the end it was a disaster. Should we say we are not hiring due to the credit specifically or a combination of things? I know we need to send a pre adverse action letter followed by an employment denial letter. I just want to make sure we can deny him based on his credit report.	
8	We have an applicant (X) who applied for a position here, who worked with client Y. Z is an employee in HR. Z heard from Y's father that there was an inappropriate relationship. The employee's friend told her that the person was applied was at another agency treating his son for substance abuse and at some point there was a relationship between the counselor and this person's son. There was a sexual relationship and possibly this person gave the son marijuana. I spoke to our executive director and we have a duty to report these things due to licensure. We contacted the other employer to notify them of possible misconduct of one of their employees.	
5	2) Candidate information - is there a law that requires employers to keep application information private?	
5	Employer wants to include an Introductory or probationary period to a new hire offer letter to an Arizona employee who has more junior skills.	
7	Our company is interested in working with an intern that goes to an art school. He has an OPT visa, he is on an F-1 visa. He has the ability to work. I wanted to verify what we need to do on our end if there is anything besides the normal hiring paper work.	
0	We are busy and doing a lot of hiring. Do you have information about what not to ask potential employees? We will talk to the managers to help them know what they can/cant ask. Do you have resources for that? What information can you provide?	
3	We brought on someone through a temp agency in our finance department. Her background/credit check is questionable?	
1	We have an intern that is a volunteer, but she is from out of the country. Can we ask for reference letters in lieu of doing a background because we know she doesn't have any documentation or record in the U.S?	
6	We have an unpaid internship for an individual with a J1 visa. The internship will last approximately 12 weeks this summer. What do we need to consider?	
5	If we rehire an employee that has been gone for 7 months does that employee need to fill out I9's and W4's again?	
8	We are in Illinois, they hired someone who is 17 in their restaurant. The restaurant has a bar, can that person serve alcohol? Can that person be in the restaurant since alcohol is served?	
8	Can you require rehires to pay back insurance premiums they owe to the company from when they previously worked for the company and were out on FMLA or on unpaid vacation?

8	What are the FLSA regulations regarding employment of a minor under the age of 18 in North Carolina? And do we need to add a policy to our handbook regarding that?	
8	One part of my job is making sure all employees have unexpired Driver Licenses / Passports to go with their I-9s. Or so I thought, until I received this email from a staff member: Hi Judd Im working on getting a new valid CA driver license. In the meantime, an expired state issued ID is valid for I-9 purposes according to the DHS handbook. Ill let you know when I get a new CA license so you can make a copy. Thanks Mike Is Mike right? Is it OK to use expired state licenses for I-9 completions?	
6	We will be hiring an individual in Georgia. We are located in Minnesota with about 260 employees, a private company. I'm trying to determine if we need to need to get E-Verify set up for this remote hire. Is E-Verify required if we only have one employee located in Georgia?	
1	I am negotiating a job offer and she says she is coming from a job with a different benefit package. We pay 50% of medical and have the employees pay 100% for dental and vision. I offered her a higher salary and she is considering it. Is there anything else I can do?	
1	We have someone who is coming back to work for us again. They have been gone for just under 6 months. She would keep all her previous seniority, right? How about the I-9?	
8	Most applications usually say individuals must be a minimum of 18 years old. We would like to say 21 - just because of the maturity level; is that a problem?	
3	Can I have a policy where I do background checks on all employees except interns? Our interns are here only for a couple of months and work about 15 hours a week.	
2	We use a HRM for our clients and they have their employees fill out new hire paperwork in this HRM. None of the I-9s are accessible in the system. Do we need to recreate all these I-9's?	
1	We have an employee we are getting ready to terminate due to hygiene issues. She has not had other performance issues. We have a feeling that she may be a hoarder which has impacted her ability to do the job. No one else will work with her because of the smell and she has been made aware of this but has not been able to improve her hygiene. What can we do if we were to want to rehire again? Can we require her to prove she no longer has this problem?	
4	We are a manufacturing facility (not open to the public). What are we allowed to ask on the application process regarding felonies? We do not currently have a question on the application about this, but would like to know what we can ask and if we can use that information in the decision making for candidates. We do not do background screenings on new hires right now either. Is that something that we would be required to do if we ask this question on our application?	
5	I have an employee who marked they are an alien authorized to work. Do they have to put their alien registration number?	
5	Submitted by unregistered user Frederick Garnier: I am about to get a new employee but it might be a 1099 contractor. Can I offer benefits from Aetna? I understand if he is an employee we have to a minimum salary, correct?

7	We have an employee who asked for time off. He was gone for 2 weeks, in conversation with the department manager about it, and there was a breakdown in communication. He requested to come back on Sunday, meaning the following Sunday. They talked on Thursday and the employee said he couldn't come in because his other job required him to come in. The employee got frustrated and quit on the phone. He called back a week later asking for his job back. I talked to him to clear the air. In the meantime, the department manager found someone else to pick up those hours so we offered him an on call position back. There was another conversation with confusion about the schedule so now we want to rescind the offer.	
0	Do you have a sample employee authorization form so that an employer can contact former employers?	
4	Can we ask someone for their age if we are hiring for a specific shift? Minors under age 16 can not work past 7pm and this shift requires someone to work past 7pm.	
5	time to fill calculator	
6	Hi, We hire seasonally for our summer season and we do have people return every season. Usually I just have them do all the hiring paperwork over again. Is that necessary or can I just re verify them? What about an application, do they always have to fill out a new one? Thanks, Becky	
5	"Valid for work only with DHS authorization" on the SS card - what does that mean?	
5	Employer would like guidance and information regarding proper administration of Form I-9?	
8	What is the standard ratio of employees to HR staff? And what is the standard ratio of open positions to a recruiter?	
0	Hello, I have a question about I-9's. If you rehire someone who has resigned a position or been terminated, can you reuse the existing I-9 for a rehire? Is there a time frame an I-9 is good for? Thanks, Agnes Lewis	
5	Should independent contractor's hours be tracked?	
8	What value is there in including the applicants referrel source on the application for employment? I've been asked to streamline our application and that's one of the questions on the chopping block. Are there any legal reasons to capture this information?	
6	Do most employers still require that prospective employees complete a drug screen e.g. within 48 hours of the job offer? We're finding more and more that we have to schedule our pre-employment physical which includes a drug screen around the prospective employees schedule. It's become a buyers market with the prospective employee able to negotiate multiple job offers.	
8	Can a Certificate of Naturalization be used for the I-9 form verification for employment? I didn't see this listed on the "what constitutes proof page".	
5	My question is, we currently need to hire temporary workers. Two of them don't have Social Security numbers. They only have Tax ID numbers. What is the legality of hiring with only a tax ID number?	
7	I have an employee who is a spouse of a person in possession of an L1A document. Does that authorize him to work in the US as well, even though he is not working for his wife's company? Or does he need additional documentation? I-765?	
6	We are preparing an offer package for a new hire nurse practitioner in our psychology practice as a W2 employee. We want to do it right. What resources are available through ThinkHR to help us develop a proper compensation, job description, offer sheet and other compliance or best practices. Thank you!	
5	Can a prison id be accepted as a proof of employment eligibility for the I9.	
2	We are adding a line to our new hire information form requesting that employees self identify EEO and Sex. How should this be worded to ensure compliance?	
6	We currently ask to make a copy of a candidate's SSC (required by Paycom our BC vendor) and Driver's License to verify correct information for running a background check (BC). Is this legal? Also, are we then able to use those documents for I-9 verification or do we open that back up to the employee to give us the documents they want to?	
6	We are hiring an employee out of state, how do we best go about completing the I-9. Employee is in Nebraska.	
7	We are hiring a Medical Doctor, does he have to fill out a job application? Or We have a signed contract with him. It that ok?	
8	Following up on the previous response. Is there something the employer needs to do in order to hire the F-1 student? We believe the internship will be considered OPT training. Does the student need a SSN?	
8	We are a contract food service management company. One of our locations is a school that runs from August-May. During the summer the employees are not working with us. Staff were informed they would have to reapply to the position again come the fall if they were still interested in the position. Are there any legality issues we need to be aware of if others from outside of last year apply to the position? Some of these workers rely on the position as their child gets a discount due to them working on-site. Thanks!	
5	We are looking into converting a contractor to a W-2 employee but he has an L2 visa. I just need to verify that this type of visa does not require employer sponsorship and is suitable as an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) (or entitles them to an EAD without requiring sponsorship). Thanks!	
5	A partner wants to hire someone who is almost 18 (will be 18 later this year). They were home schooled so didn't attend traditional high school. They applied for a job setting up booths at a farmers market. I'm not sure that he has graduated - what do they need to keep in mind?	
7	I have a new employee who completed the I9 form and marked his citizenship status as Alien Authorized to Work. He provided the expiration date and his A #, however the documents he provided were a driver's license and social security card. Since he marked his is an alien authorized to work, does he have to provide his EAD card?	
8	I have a new employee who completed an I9 form. One of the documents she presented was a native American tribal card. The card doesn't provide any information other than she is a member (no member ID or document #). I have verified that the tribe is federally recognized, but am unsure how to list the documentation under list C. Do I just write the name of the documentation?	
6	We made a verbal offer to an employee in Indiana. We are rescinding the offer because he can't start for two weeks; are we at risk of violating any Indiana rules regarding verbal contracts?	
5	I am seeking to get some more information on what should I be providing a candidate when we decided to withdraw a job offer due to a background results. I also need a copy of a withdrawn of employment offer template if possible. Your time is greatly appreciated.	
8	Im hoping you can provide me with some information on our client's ability to perform background checks and drug testing during the prescreening process. Currently, they run criminal background checks during the prescreening process, in which theyre verifying that no potential employees have any violent, fraudulent or theft-related convictions. We know the laws are changing all the time and California in particular has so many privacy laws, I just want to ensure we are in compliance. Can we still perform this type of screening in California, Minnesota and Alabama? Also, we conduct drug tests during the prescreening process, in which potential employees visit a third party medical facility and we are sent results whether the drug test was positive or negative. Since Californias laws changed regarding the use of marijuana, I am not sure how this is affected. Can you let me know? Also, can you let me know if this process is in compliance for both Minnesota and Alabama?	
5	From client: Do we still have to keep a paper copy of the W4 tax form if we are doing recruiting online? I read this section from this link. http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-Top-10-Form-W-4-questions-for-2014/$FILE/EY-Top-10-Form-W-4-questions-for-2014.pdf	
8	Can you confirm if the job builder has actual samples of job descriptions or if what comes up in the builder is it and then the company takes it from there?	
6	We are a staffing agency. One of our clients had found that the temp we were trying to place had a charge and that that charge had been dismissed. As the employer of record, we are not going to deny employment to this person, but the client will not take them, so we are unable to place them with that employer, though the offer has been made and accepted. As the employer of record, what liability do we have? Is what theyre doing right? We will try to find another position for this individual.	
6	I have a program in which we offer junior coaching positions. These positions are much like an internship where the junior coach is not a paid position. Do I need to obtain a work permit for these unpaid positions?	
6	Good Afternoon, We are getting ready to call back a few employees that have been laid off for approximately a month. Are there any requirements we need to follow other than the basic drug screen and paperwork? If they originally went through an orientation should they go through it again or would a refresher course be ok and if so at what point should we treat them as a "New Hire" ? Thank you	
6	We are evaluating our recruitment questions, we are a federal contractor. A big requirement is for a candidate to be able to obtain secret clearances in order to work for us on our federal contracts. Those are the only positions we have. Are we legally allowed to ask if they are able to obtain a secret clearance since it is associated with citizenship? They wouldnt be able to work on a contract that has that requirement and those are the only types of clients/contracts we have, so there wouldnt have another position or any work for them to do without the secret clearance.	
1	Account manager has a question we are considering placing a girl whose employment verification says not eligible for rehire. We were conducting a background check. Can we ask her about why that company will not hire her?

0	Do you have a sample Non-Compete Agreement for new hires that I can review and send to my client? Client Name: Allied Landscape.	
4	As far as background checks go, it is beneficial for us to ask if someone has any previous convictions on the application or is it better for us to not know this information as it could put us at risk if we knowingly hire someone who has a previous conviction and something ends up happening during their employment with us?	
6	We have a former employee we terminated last month. She was re-hired and started last Friday. Do we need to complete new forms? Benefits, do we reinstate?	
4	What are you allowed to ask on an application regarding criminal background	
0	Hello, Hoping to be provided with guidance/information on 1099 contract workers. What are the requirements to consider someone a 1099 contract worker? Are they paid per project? Thank you! Jessica Quintana	
8	our RN Managers are salaried, work DAY shift and work one weekend per month. Our DON, wants to have them take "on-call" responsibilities the week of their scheduled weekend. Example, if a nurse calls in on 2nd or 3rd shift, if no one else could come in, the on call RN Manager would have to come in for the shift. they would be allowed to flex their schedule/take a different day off if that would happen. would this "on call" piece have to be in their job description?	
7	We run background checks on all of our candidates after offering them employment. The employee started a couple of days ago, contingent upon a clear background check. His background check came back with a felony. I usually pull people aside and talk with them about the circumstances. He admitted that he had stolen something at age 18, he said it was a misdemeanor and it was six years ago, that he learned his lesson. I feel that it isnt job relevant and that it okay to hire him.	
1	We had an employee apply for a job. The employee's must also pass the superior court background check. She passed the initial background test, but then did not pass the live check. She marked that she did not have prior convictions, when she did. Therefore, we rescinded the job offer. She consulted with legal and eventually was cleared for hiring. Are we obligated to offer her the job at this point? At the time, we didn't think she was the best fit and would like to explore more qualified candidates.	
6	If we have an independent contractor, which forms are we required to distribute? What if it's a non-U.S. contractor?	
3	We were running a background check on a new hire and the report came back with an conviction that was reversed. Our manager then decided we should run background checks on all active employees to see if anything came up that they hadn't disclosed. We have background authorization forms on file for most of these from when they were hired and the check was originally run. Can we run them again without collecting a new authorization? Can we consider this candidate's conviction that was reversed? Can we run background checks for any reason?	
0	I have a San Francisco contract that I am updating for San Diego. Can you send me guidance regarding paid sick leave, wages, final pay that may differ from San Francisco?	
8	We interviewed a candidate for a nursing position, and then made an offer of employment based on our recruitment process. The candidate cleared the standard background and drug testing, however, when we ran the information to check the state license they had some red flags come up under other states, indicating that they had lost their license in some. The problem is that they are showing as having an active license in Georgia which is where we are hiring. Based on the information we discovered when verifying the license, we no longer want to hire this individual. Are we able to use this information to rescind the offer if it wasn't found during a background check?

2	We're getting ready to hire a new driver and the requirements are overwhelming to get him started. This is a DOT/CDL driver. Its hard to know what forms are required and what are suggested.	
6	When we hire, we do a pre-employment drug screen and then they do safety training. If they do not come back can we deduct it?	
8	I have a question about liability. Is it possible for us to have an employee's teenager provide free childcare during a company holiday party? What would the liability on this be? We are in WA state.	
7	via phone: I had an employee who started working for me. He went to go get his paperwork. He kept saying he forgot it. It's been a couple of weeks now. No W-4, and as of yet we have not paid him. He did not provide anything for the I-9. What do we do about this? We have an application, but that's it. We did track his hours. He quit and said "free labor for you" instead of turning in forms.	
8	The cost of the attorney fee and cost to file the employer must bear that cost and the employer can not ask the employee to pay a portion or bind the employee in any type of agreement. I want to confirm that we can not require them to bear any part of the cost - posting, Can we have delayed benefits for those who are on a H1B as a way to save money? Would this be discriminatory?

4	Could you please respond? Can you clarify for us if we are able to ask on an employment application if they have ever filed for bankruptcy Regards, Theresa Lofgren	
4	Our current application asks: Have you ever been convicted of a crime, excluding misdemeanors and summary offenses, which has not been annulled, expunged or sealed by the court? (a yes response does not automatically disqualify your application) Is this a legal question?

4	questions I cannot ask in an interview	
4	Can a company ask a potential new employee or a W2 form so they can verify if the new employee is telling the truth about past employment salary information?	
4	We have taken off the criminal background question on the application. However, can an employer ask an employee regarding prior convictions during the interview process? We hire employee's for the superior court.	
8	I have a client who manages apartment complexes. They have onsite property managers who receive part of the salary through rent credit. I know there is a max of $568 dollars which can be applied. Are there any other best practices or typical onsite property management agreements, etc. that you could provide?	
6	We have an individual who is a paid through an outside contractor and we are bringing them on. Can we do their I-9 before they start? So for instance, can I do the I-9 on the 21st even though hire date is the 24th?	
5	One of my managers wants to put a culture statement in our job description. I want to run the statement by someone.	
8	Best practice for offers letters to be give at time of employment and not ahead of time. I have a candidate asking for one ahead of the start date. Is the unusual?	
8	Follow up question to unpaid intern question from yesterday. What are the employers responsibilities if using unpaid interns? Is there paperwork that needs to be completed? Are the work hours specific or can it be no more than 40 hours a week? Also need to know if the answer to the above is per state or nationwide obligations. Thank you!	
8	Due to our client contracts, we are obligated to hire only US citizens or legal permanent residents. Is it legal to ask in a questionnaire if a candidate is either of those statuses or does the question need to be phrased in a different way?	
0	I overheard someone in an interview. They asked the question "Do you drink alcohol? Do you smoke?" And a red flag went up. Are those improper questions? Is there a way to make them proper if we phrase them correctly? This is for the State of Utah.	
3	Our policy is that we do a criminal background check and urinalysis. Our practice has been that as long as the candidate discloses what may come up against a background check, and they pass the drug test, and this is validated by the background check, we generally move forward with the hire. One candidate had disclosed a conviction from possession, but was "fuzzy" about the actual dates (changed from July to January). When questioning this, the employee stated she failed a drug test at the court. We are now hesitant to hire because of that comment.	
2	I am trying to pull together a benefit proposal for our first Canadian employee - we don't plan to grow the office and would use a 3rd party payroll provider. Can you send me any resources to outline the differences in benefits provided to Canadian employees (versus US, 401k, FSA etc.) or any benchmarks for benefits provided by tech companies (% of health care covered etc.) Also required documentation/forms we need to give to Canadian new hire if required. (I9 documentation?)	
6	For I-9 forms do we need to get copies of identification in color? or can black and whit copies be accepted. Do we keep copies of the Identification copies with the I-9 or do we not keep those anymore?	
0	Are we required to provide interview scores to candidates or can we simply provide a pass/fail notification? Is it recommended to provide score vs. pass/fail? What information do you have available to help in this regard?	
6	I have questions about the I-9 process. We are so spread out, we have switched payroll companies and HR practioners multiple times. I realize we need to clean up our records as some I-9s are missing for PT employee that are remote. Do I have to follow up with terminated employees whose forms are missing? What about employees who have been here longer than three years but I can't find an I-9 for them? Are employers required to send completed I-9s to the government or just have them on file?	
2	Regarding the newly revised Form-9: weve had a few questions regarding whether you need to recertify current employee I-9's. Are we correct in saying that emplyers SHOULD NOT recertify I-9s for current employees? And that the revised Form I-9 is ONLY to be used for new hires?	
1	Via VM - I have a question about an employee. Please call me back at (760) 396-6243. New employee, gave me copy of SSN and Green card that looked fake. She gave me attitude when I questioned the documents. I asked her if she had a drivers license. She said she doesn't have a drivers license.

8	Follow up question to unpaid intern question from yesterday. What are the employers responsibilities if using unpaid interns? Is there paperwork that needs to be completed? Are the work hours specific or can it be no more than 40 hours a week? Also need to know if the answer to the above is per state or nationwide obligations.	
8	When onboarding, is the same person that completed the I-9 form need to be the same person who does e-Verify?	
5	Intern does not have his Social Security card, what other documents are acceptable instead?	
8	Should team leads have the authority to write up an employee and discipline them, or should this be a manager only function.	
3	Employer is developing an On-boarding SOP. Is it a best practice to have the employee come in on a post-offer/pre-hire basis to complete the I-9, e-verify, sign offer letter and the background check authorization? What if the e-verify results in a "TNC"? Should the employer then proceed with the background check or wait until the TNC is resolved?	
5	Am I allowed to hire someone 16 years old for janitorial work?	
4	In our recruitment process we do ask for the applicant's desired "salary range" and we are hesitant to disclose our range to potential applicants. When asked what we pay, what is a good blanket statement?	
5	Many of our hiring managers think we should exclude the may we contact this employer when an applicant indicates this is their current employer. Thoughts?	
2	Pre-Adverse Action Notice; what is a "reasonable time" for the employer to give a new hire to resolve issue?	
1	Hello! We hired an outside salesperson for a training round with several other hires. The rest of the hires were able to attend in person but due to personal reasons, she had to attend remotely. Her performance has not been satisfactory during the training. We are not sure whether it's due to the remote situation or not (none of the other trainees who attended in person are having any trouble), but we need our trainees to hit the ground running. We want to rescind her offer and potentially extend her a new offer later in the summer for a future round that she could attend in person. Is there any restrictions against doing so that we should consider? We hired 4 sales people who were planning on coming to training onsite. One could not get childcare and chose to participate remotely. After a week we found it was not a good fit. There were some technical issues but it just seemed she was not getting it quickly. After speaking with her regarding the issues it was decided not to proceed with her employment. We gave her the option to potentially start again in the future. Is this a termination? Can she be paid as an independent contractor for the time she spent training?

We have not yet given him the written offer letter, but he called us yesterday to say that he has been dx with cancer and may need some time off for radiation treatment.

2	I need a template to follow for onboarding procedures when the new hire is one (1) person. It is difficult to schedule multiple managers for one new hire.	
4	I'm redoing our application and have a few questions. If we ask if someone is under 18, can we ask their birth date? There is a self identification area - if we put male or female is that ok? Or do we have to put transgender or other. And on the whole section do we have to put prefer not to disclose or voluntary? I'm trying to gather demographic, info gender ethnicity, military, disabled.

8	I am working on a conversion (hourly to full-time) for an attorney. The position requires billable hours. The manager wants language about how we will drop the employee back down to part-time if the billable hours do not meet the requirements.

8	I have a question. One of the websites that we use to recruit new hires (Indeed.com) offers various questions that we can choose to ask potential hires as part of the screening process. The questions vary from whether or not the candidate has the required experience asked of them to whether or not they would be willing to submit to a background check or drug screening. A candidate who applied for the position chewed me out via e-mail (after applying) stating how completely inappropriate it was to ask such a question. If it were illegal or inappropriate, wouldn't the website make sure not to even suggest asking such questions to potential hires? It was a very frustrating conversation, nonetheless, but huge red flag so as to steer clear of the candidate from the onset.	
7	We did a background check on an employee who has been working for us as a temp for the past 3 months. We wanted to hire him so did a background check. The check came back with a Battery with substantial bodily harm, category C Felony in which was dishonorably discharged in 2014.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Per our company policy we put him on a 90 day medical leave and he was supposed to bring me doctors paperwork to support this leave of absence. He never did and after 90 days I just moved his file to job abandonment and took him out of the system. He has since asked to be rehired. The manager wants to interview him but wants a medical statement showing that he is fit for duty so to speak. I am not sure if we can demand a medical fit for duty document as we do not require this from anyone else.	
6	We have seasonal crossing guards who are off for the summer, and then we bring them back for the school year. We have employees who are eligible to return to these positions, but we also have new applicants who are also qualified. We normally post internally (not for these seasonal positions) and then post the position externally to have applications on file. Are we required to bring these new individuals in to interview if we are planning to bring the other individuals back?

I know they are a tough state and just registering for an payroll tax account and unemployment isn't all you have to do. I believe you have to have additional disability by the state of CA and there are also weird franchise tax laws.

7	To hire people, we do physical ability test. On Friday, a candidate was not allowed to complete the test, stopped in the middle of it, due to high blood pressure. They referred him to his regular doctor. This is someone who we have had here working from a temp agency and we are hiring him to full time status. He showed up to work today. Can we not proceed with hiring him? Hes already on our payroll as of 1/3, when we converted from the temp agency. Can we terminate him? Can we give him back to the temp agency?

6	We have a fiscal assistant position available and we are struggling in finding someone with the right skill set. We partnered with a staffing agency, local governments.	
3	We never request a drug-screening from an applicant until the applicant has received an employment offer and has accepted. Is there a problem with running a background check before an offer is made "if" we have them sign a consent form to do so? This would be only after the applicant has also completed and signed an employment application which also has language in it that we may check references and work history.

1	A manager extended a verbal offer of employment to a candidate in the state of Colorado. The employee has shown up a couple of times but is never prepared to complete her new hire paperwork. We have not completed her I-9 verification and she has called off a few times as well. We feel we can't hire he because she's not cooperating. Questions: Is a verbal offer enforceable in Colorado? Can we rescind the offer?	
6	Are we able to tell people we don't sponsor visa's?	
7	We were looking at hiring someone. We did the drug test and sent information on orientation. Now we don't want to hire him anymore. He worked here before, about 2.5 years ago. I noticed there was a one year gap in employment. After doing a reference check we found out from a past employer he was let go after he did not return to work after filing a workers comp claim. We also found out he filed multiple workers comp claims. We are concerned he is going to do this with us as well.

1	I just want to confirm - we have a training program for interns and residents working towards experience continuation or board certification in their area of discipline. An employee was suspended from completing out rotations as a disciplinary action. We wanted her to focus her efforts on some of the other requirements of her program and not the out rotations. Any rotations would need to be done on completion of her employment. She is going to continue to offer services in a 1099 capacity. If she chooses, we are willing to allow her to perform some out rotations here. Is there anything I should be concerned about. We also host externs (those finishing graduate or undergraduate programs).	
5	How to attract and retain good candidates	
1	Follow up to today's earlier issue. The store manager sent an email to the new hire indicating that he will allow her to show up this Friday to discuss whether she wants this job or not. He was very clear on the job and attendance expectations and her requirement to be able to open the store in the mornings, or have reliable communications to notify someone if she cannot. The new hire responded very appropriately thanking him for the opportunity. So, we are not moving forward with her termination. But, how should we manage beyond Friday? She has stated that she lives up in the mountains and does not have reliable cell phone coverage.	
7	It's regarding employment of disabled individual. I need guidance on how to articulate he is not the right fit for the company.

6	Is it possible for a joint/dual employment relationship to exist where we give offer letter we own the employee (treat them as our own) BUT they are payrolled through an agency and receive benefits through the agency? I know this sounds like a standard temp to perm situation but we are trying to have more ownership than that. I think PEOs do this but I don't know how.	
7	We have a temp who we are in the process of hiring. The employee has been sent twice for drug testing and has been unable to produce a specimen. Second time, the clinic gave him water to drink and he stated he still couldn't produce a specimen. We are thinking of withdrawing the employment offer.	
6	This questions is in regards to unsolicited employment inquiries /applications /resumes. We are a pipeline construction & maintenance co that performs work in multiple states. In this industry it is very common to have high turnover (layoffs) & frequent hiring , as work &needs are project based. The employees in the industry are accustomed to working at 1 contractor for a few months, getting laid-off & moving to the next contractor that has work. It is not uncommon for our typical employees to work for 3 -4 employers per year. Given this, we get numerous calls a week from individuals that work in the industry, and are interested in working for us, checking if we will be hiring soon, etc. Currently we provide an application to those individuals to complete and we keep it on file, sorted by trade/position for possible review if hiring needs arise for that trade. (we do NOT post for any of these positions) What risks/liabilities are involved with this?	
4	We are a CA employer with about 1350 employees in 3 states and were wondering if we can ask for date of birth, social security number, and driver's license information on the application.

4	I work for a small charter school in Florida. They function under their own charter. It has not been their practice to have a prospective hire fill out an employment application. They provide a resume, their references (which are checked) are drug tested pre employment and fingerprinted so information is checked across the US. Do we legally have to create an employment application? Is it any type of legal requirement?

For a second interview, they want them to come back with a detailed presentation of how exactly they would run a program that they've just started up. They want them to address how they would raise funds, short term, mid term, and long term. Is that proprietary to the candidates that aren't chosen? Since it is the candidate's property. Would the employer sign something saying the employer/company wouldn't use their ideas since it is the candidate's property if they were not hired? You can talk with me or Donna.

7	As an IT outsourcing company we employ individuals scattered across the US to work at client facilities. We are looking to hire an employee in AZ, who was asked to complete a drug test as part of our onboarding process. The candidate has informed us that he is a medical marijuana card holder, which has not been an issue with his previous AZ employers because AZ law legalizes medical marijuana. Since his new employer (us), is located in Michigan is he subject to Michigan's laws regarding the use of medical marijuana? Can we make a clean test a condition of employment, despite the laws that exist in AZ? Additionally, he will be operating heavy machinery, which is a clause in the AZ House Bill 2541. If the position is considered safety-sensitive (will be operating heavy machinery) and could risk the safety of the public or others, the use of medical marijuana would not be permitted and thus he would not be eligible for employment.

We would also take on the responsibility that all previous tests were completed in accordance with the regulation. Can an we deny employment opportunities solely based on information that an applicant is enrolled in a DOT/FAA Direct Observation Follow-Up Program or is this considered discriminatory? Thank you.

7	Jennifer Ward, jenward77@yahoo.com We had layoffs in March. We are considering bringing someone back temporarily to cover someone's absence.

1	A tenacious producer seeking employment saw our job post on LinkedIn and called our CEO directly on his cell phone while he was away on vacation. Our CEO then asked me to coordinate an interview with her, which I coordinated for this week. In the meantime, we uncovered some informal confidential ("off the books") negative references about this individual from trustworthy sources (mutual connections of the candidate and senior management). I have now been instructed to cancel the interview and tell this individual that the position has been filled, which it hasn't. She has not formally applied through LinkedIn yet. I feel that cancelling and failing to schedule the interview while continuing to actively recruit indicates discrimination in hiring. At this point, what can be said to rescind an interview? Must we at least have a phone conversation with her? What are our options and what rights could she have since by scheduling an interview we have deemed her qualified?

However, if an offer is ACCEPTED can we then put a question in their background check consent through our background check vendor asking for criminal history (dates, conviction, details, etc.) and also ask for salary history? What I'm really looking for are those who lie or omit information. Since we can't ask this in an application any longer, I want to make sure we can ask it when most lawful. Also, after an offer is accepted, some candidates don't want their current employer contacted via background check co. so I ask for a W2, check stub, or offer letter to verify current employment. Is this still ok since an offer was accepted?

8	Can section 2 of the I-9 be completed 3 days before or 3 days after the employee's 1st day? Can section 2 be completed 1 week before the employee's 1st day? _____ Our Response: Per our conversation, the Handbook for Employers for the Form I-9 indicates that the employer may not begin the Form I-9 process prior to an accepted job offer. Section 2 can not be completed until Section 1 has been completed without error. The USCIS states that the deadline for completing Section 2 of the Form I-9 is within the third business day of the employee's hire date (first day of employment). Reference: Failure to Complete Section 1 You must ensure that all parts of Form I-9 are properly completed; otherwise, you may be subject to penalties under federal law. Section 1 must be completed no later than the end of the employees first day of employment. You may not ask an individual who has not accepted a job offer to complete Section 1. Before completing Section 2, you should review Section 1 to ensure the employee completed it properly. If you find any errors in Section 1, have the employee make any necessary corrections and initial and date them. Completing Section 2 Within three business days of the date employment begins, the employee must present to you an original document or documents that show their identity and employment authorization. For example, if an employee begins employment on Monday, you must review the employees documentation and complete Section 2 on or before Thursday of that week. However, if you hire an individual for less than three business days, you must complete Section 2 no later than the end of the first day of employment. The employee must be allowed to choose which document(s) they will present from the Form I-9 Lists of Acceptable Documents. You cannot specify which document(s) an employee will present from the list.

Can employers ask the applicant what the injuries were and how long ago it was? 3) Can employers ask the applicant if he/she is free of injury and or illness and fit for duty on the job application?

The employee was upset because she was interviewed and came into the interview voicing her opinion. Others internal and external to the agency informed our President & CEO that she was on Social Media and talked about being interviewed by 3 persons for the position and she did not think it was necessary. The President & CEO would like for me and another HR staff to talk to her about it. I have just reviewed our Social Media Policy and think she was entitled to provide her opinion. I would not have put anything on Social Media pertaining to my job and how I felt I was wronged. I am not on any social media so it is hearsay and I am reluctant to talk to her. Our policy also states that we will not improperly interfere with employee's rights. I don't want any HR staff to risk being sued. I will call to discuss further.

7	An employee quit about 1.5 yrs. He was dealing personal issues which created performance problems at work. He's looking for work with us again and I'm willing to consider rehiring him but I would like to do as on a temporary basis of 60 days or with a 60-day probationary period. I would also like to tie in the benefits waiting period so that if things don't work out I can terminate without having offered group benefits. How would I handle vacation accruals? Vacation begins accruing on the first day of work for regular employees. Can I set his up so that if he meets the 60-day period and we keep him, we will alot the vacation accruals back to his start date?

Please let me know if you have any questions, and here is there inquiry: -We hired a new delivery driver and he went for his DOT physical because he drives in Illinois and that is what they require. Because of the way he answered some questions, the dr has now said he needs a sleep test because of possible sleep apnea. The new employee doesn't have insurance and he was given a 3 month temporary DOT license. Since he can't get the insurance for 91 days, do we have to pay for the sleep test and whatever else comes about if he needs meds? Thank you, Shirah Swanson

1	NJ - interviewed candidate, resume states she was presently employed with last employer and she specifically told us she was currently working there. Verification showed she was not - the owner of that practice said she was not eligible for rehire. We want to know if we can rescind the offer.	
8	We are a California company with locations across the country. When we process background checks, do we follow CA state laws or the laws of the state the employee will work in? For example, if a candidate in North Carolina has a felony from 15 years ago, can it be used in consideration of his employment, or not because it is past the 7 years allowed by California? Thank you!	
8	Client is a law enforcement agency that has contact with female prisoners. There is a specific role of "matron' that supervises female prisoners including body searches.

2	HIPP notice. New Marketplace coverage notice.	
3	via phone: 2 of 2 We don't have a policy yes with our drivers for getting background checks or DMV reports pre-hire. This is for CA and NJ. Is there a issue with getting background checks/DMV on drivers? They are driving company vehicles and it is an essential function of the job. If put them on our commercial insurance our rate does go up. I'm concerned about conducting those checks in CA and NJ especially with the new ban the box laws. We would be adding this as a part of their essential job function to all job postings and to job descriptions.	
6	We are ready to make an offer to a candidate. In our handbook we have a statement that we have an initial employment period, training time/trial time for 90 days. Would you suggest we include this verbiage in the offer letter too? Does it make a difference we there exempt or nonexempt?

5	In Michigan, is it considered discrimination to require that a person has a car in order to be hired?	
8	We want to change our process of collecting forms so they are acknowledged electronically. Our onboarding system already obtains consent to electronically fill out I-9's , sign for the handbook, W2-s etc. so I think we can carry that over to the non-compete and non-confidentiality agreement. Is this true? Also, is it necessary for the employer (manager) to sign or acknowledge it after the employee has already signed it?

6	The company is under 50 employees. We are going to approach someone we are going to hire. We want to make sure we are in compliance with affirmative action.

8	We formerly had an Assistant Director position. The individual in that position left the company, and was told the position was eliminated. Although we did not rehire for the position, the reason for the termination was actually due to the performance of the individual, and not a true position elimination. It has been two years. We have a need for this position now, so it has been filled. What is the employer's risk of doing this? We have the same situation with an Office Manager position.

2	Hello -- We have a client that employs across multiple states. The question from HR is: Since there's no state tax withholding form for the state of Nevada, what other forms does a new hire need to complete other than the Federal form (I assume HR is referring to I-9).	
8	We are looking for a way to provide unsuccessful internal candidates feedback after interviews. What is best practice around storing interview notes for candidates who are already employed by the company? (We are leaning towards storing these notes separately from the personnel file - on the recruiting side of the house.) Is there substantial risk to keeping internal candidate notes in personnel files? I'm also trying to understand if it is legal to ask candidates to take action or describe progress on prior feedback as part of re-applying for the same role? Thanks for your help!	
6	We are starting self audit on our I-9's: Want to discuss acceptable form of ID as well as citizenship status vs what they tell us? We're doing an I-9 self-audit. It sounds like for permanent residents those folks do not need to be verified? If someone checks of they are a lawful permanent resident and they provide and driver's license and SS Card, they don't need to provide the Permanent Resident Card, correct? Some folks may have put lawful permanent resident and gave Lists B and C including unrestricted Social Security Card. Are they technically a US Citizen? We have somebody who provided a Massachusetts EBT Card as a List B document. Did that suffice?	
2	Good Day, What forms are required for new hires in the state of Nevada? I want to create a new hire employment packet.	
8	References Hi, We had a potential employer for a terminated employee call one of our supervisors on the company number to ask them for "Professional References". Normally, I take all Employment verification calls but this really wasn't that type of call. How would we handle this call? From my experience we aren't supposed to give opinions on job performance, work ethic or any of those things. Can you please advise on what we should do in this case? Should they have called this person on their personal phone to ask these questions???? Have a fantastic day!!!

We will just ask them to write down their hours and then we complete everything later.

7	We had two candidates that we offered. We have MVR, background and drug test. The background came back with two felonies. I know the new law passed about criminal records. The felonies are for assault and battery. This employee would have to go into customer homes and we are concerned about that. The MVR came back and if he has one more issue he wouldn't be covered by our insurance.	
8	I have received a resume that was submitted a year ago from an agency. If fact, they submitted it to me in July 2016 and October 2016. Is it a year that the individual is tied to the agency?

He hasn't done the I-9 yet and we asked if he was interested and he said yes and we started the hiring process.	
6	I-9 vs. Everify. We are a CPA Firm, is is required to use Everify for our I-9s? Or is written verification acceptable? Additionally, how long must we keep I-9s on record? For example, we have company owners I-9's that date back to the 80's-- should they fill out newer versions? do we have to continue to keep these on file? Additionally, how long must we keep terminated employee I-9's on file?	
8	What is best practice when it comes to doing employment verification before an offer is made? What about having the applicant fill out the background release form in the hiring process? What about asking for IDs and taking copies when the person comes in for the interview?

8	We had one company with 150 employees---which was "split" into 2 employers, when 30 of the employees were moved to the parent company (that previously had no employees). Question: should we set up our parent company for it's own background screening and drug/alcohol testing, and not use the original company's for new employees coming to work for the parent company??	
8	Do we have to give pamphlets such as DE 2511 or DFEH 185 to the employees as a printed out copy, or is displaying the information on posters in the store sufficient?	
0	Can you send me sample application forms?	
0	I have removed some questions from our online employment applic. to comply with Ban the Box rules mandated in some states. However, looking at a couple remaining questions I wonder if I am still not complying. We are a transportation Co and these relate to driving privileges.

Have you ever been convicted of reckless driving, careless driving or careless operation of a motor vehicle?

6	Our business is regulated by a state agency which requires we have all employees tested (TB test, drug screen, criminal background check) prior to allowing them to begin work. We pay for this testing for every new hire. When a new hire doesn't work out (no call, no show after first day; displays insubordinate behavior; etc), can we legally deduct the testing fees from their pay if we disclose our policy in advance and the EE acknowledges receipt of our policy? We operate in both Texas and California so can you please let me know if your answer differs based on where we are doing business? Thanks!!!

6	We are a staffing agency. The employer has had his employees hired through another staffing agency. I'm finding out that there may be some employees who may not be able to show documents to work. We are a nonprofit and we have grants to do subcontracts for the government. If we choose to e-verify employees in one division and not in another. They have different FEIN numbers. Would we be required to use e-verify for everyone.	
8	We have a W-4 where the employee signed it and wrote into all of the fields with the exception of city and state. Can we fill these in on his behalf, or is this some sort of violation?

5	For the I-9 do you know how it says on there someone can present a medical ID? Someone wants to present a medical marijuana card? We are in California.	
5	What are required documents HR should retrieve and verify when hiring a medical doctor? Are medical doctors required to fill out a job application even if they sign an employment agreement?	
3	Compliance question - I read something about changes effective July 1st, having to do with background checks and previous salary. Does this only impact the background check or does it involve interview questions as well? We have offices in AZ, MA and CA.	
7	We are in the process of hiring 70 employees in Arizona and one of these employees has come back with a positive drug screen for marijuana. He is stating that he has a medicinal marijuana card, and that we cannot fail to hire him because of the positive drug test. Is that accurate? Can we request proof that he has the card?	
2	I have a question on paperless paperwork and specifically the I-9 form. We have our new hires complete their forms prior to their first day, but for some reason have them complete the I-9 form on their first day. Are we able to have them complete prior or why couldnt we if not?

Three of us interviewed him in our office. He has given us a reference in France where he worked and I plan to talk to that reference tomorrow. He is currently working for an architect (for over two years) that I once worked for when I was a graduate student so I believe he is qualified based on my own experience working for that architect. He obviously does not want me to call his current employer. Is there any other background check that you would recommend? He will have a 90 day trial period.

7	We recently hired an "emerging professional" that will work with us for a year. He is a student, from China, & has an Employment Authorization Card (Form 1-766). I'm unclear whether or not we should deduct Social Security & Medicare from his paycheck. This also leads to another question. I don't routinely E-Verify my 1-9's.

1	We made a job offer to a candidate but she failed the drug test. She had a timeframe in which to provide a doctor's rx to justify the failed drug test. She failed to provide that rx to the MRO. We then rescinded the offer. She came to us 48 hours after the rescinding, and stated that is discriminatory because she has a medical condition and she is covered by the ADA. That was the first we heard anything about a medical condiiton. In the meantime, we hired a new director who wanted to interview all candidates for the position, so I told this candidate we would put her back in the hiring pool to be interviewed by the new director. She interviewed with the director and the director felt she was not the most qualified for the job. We are still interviewing, have not filled the position, and when I spoke to her originally, I told her to not quit her job. Now she is telling us that she has already quit her job and we are creating a loss of income for her. How should we manage?

5	If we have an open position internal position, can the manager who manages an employee now who applied speak to the other manager about their performance?	
6	We are acquiring another business and we are hiring a bunch of employees. Most will be regular employees who will work for us. There are two who are contract labor who will not be on our payroll and we will just have a 1099 from us. These individuals were 1099 with the other company as well.	
4	Can we ask before interview the person's legal status?

8	We hired an employee for certain compliance responsibilities and they have reached their 90 day introductory period. However, due to upper management request, the employee was never given an opportunity to truly learn the job they were originally hired for and the role for this employee has changed .

6	What concerns should we be thinking about as far as hiring minors (16-18) in a warehouse setting in a temporary capacity while they would not be using heavy equipment it would still be present on the work site. Also hours would be 8AM-5PM, no more than 40 hours a week.	
6	We are in Texas and are looking to hire an employee in Wyoming. I don't think they have a state income tax so I would guess I don't need to work about that but what else do I need to be concerned about? We use a third party payroll provider.	
6	My question is related to how long a position may be considered "temporary". We have a position that was originally a high school student working 2 hours/day in the afternoons and we have labeled it a "temporary" position.

8	This group is a franchisee of Burger King. They are a 650 employee group being acquired by a private equity firm. They would like to issue a new hire package to the employees (offer letter, job description, employee handbook acknowledgement, etc). Is there an efficient way to distribute to hundreds of employees rather than printing and stuffing hundreds of envelopes that is still considered a best practice?	
3	We made a verbal offer, contingent on background check and physical exam. The background check came back with an arrest for a felony, using computer to facilitate child sex, contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The felony was reduced to a misdemeanor and he is prohibited from having unsupervised contact with any minors. The essential function of the job is to deliver products into retail stores where there would potentially be unsupervised minors. Can we rescind our offer?	
6	I am looking to find staff: We are an inpatient facility we will have our clients complete program and depending on how the probationary periods go we will keep them on staff. What if we need marketing staff or higher level positions or specialized jobs? Do you have any suggestions on where to look? Headhunters can be somewhat pricey.	
7	This is a follow up to my 8/3 issue. The candidate in question was told by their recruiter that we had decided to move forward and continue interviewing. The candidate is pushing back stating he perceives we're making a decision based on general knowledge of his publicized crime and claiming he should have the opportunity to discuss any questions with the company. The hiring manager would like to send a written response addressing the reasons he will not be moving forward - that he's overqualified for the position, we're looking for a worker bee and there is no room for growth into management through this position as he's looking for and finally, that we did not use background information. What are your thoughts on responding to him?	
5	Can an employer sign an I-9 electronically upon reviewing the supporting documentation?	
8	I sent an offer of employment and the candidate never returned the letter. I was unable to get him on the phone also. I want to move ahead to offer other candidates, but I am afraid to do so and then get the offer signed by the first candidate. Is there any protocol, letter that can be sent stating that due to your failure to answer you are not longer consider for the position?

6	We have an internship program this summer, and we are planning to make some offers for next summer positions. We have a position we expect to be open, but it doesn't have a job description.

4	We have an applicant who did not complete his application. Can we still contact his former employers?

7	Chris called in for John, if needed she will request to be added as a registered user. We have had a temp employee work for us last summer and now this summer. The branch that wants to hire him again through a temp agency, converting him from a temp to a regular hire. He is a registered sex offender. The employee is open about the mistake he made and has talked with us about it. Theyre comfortable hiring him and have spoken with his parole officer. We want to make sure that no one could sue us. It was a one-time incident and he has been very up front. We wouldnt want to put ourselves in any situation where it jeopardizes us. The job he has performed as a temp and would continue to perform as a regular employee is putting up tents, setting up chairs, driving a company vehicle. 99% of the time hed have another crew member with him. We would have control of the sites we would send him to. We would not send him to sites with children, as the conviction involved a minor. We would be careful as far as what jobs he would be placed at. We want to talk about the risks if we proceed with hiring this individual. Please cc: Chris at chris@weisertentservice.com

2	We are hiring a temp employee through a staffing agency. What new hire docs should he receive?	
3	Does FCRA apply to a church that is conducting background checks for volunteers that work with children under the age of 18. Our local Cheif of Police is a congregational member so he processes the background checks through his job for a nominal fee. The volunteers are not employees. Would the Chief of Police be considered a third party provider.	
8	We have a client who has not been using the e-verify system for new hires for quite some time. Can someone let us know what they need to do to come into compliance (is there a program to get back in compliance without getting into too much trouble)? Are there any penalties or issues they will face for not doing it these past few months? Any information surrounding this would be helpful thanks!	
1	We have employed a lawful permanent resident recently and she has given us an Alien Registration Number/USCIS Number but no proof of it. Is there anything else we need to do?	
8	Our organization provides in home services to individuals with disabilities. One individual in our care has a severe allergy to cigarette smoke, even on clothes. We are needing to recruit and hire new staff to work with this client. What is your guidance on how to address this with applicants during the interview process? Would it be best during the first interview/pre-screening to state to the applicant "the location I am interviewing for has an individual with a severe allergy to cigarette smoke, do you smoke?" or would these questions need to be asked post job offer?	
4	can you ask a potential employee if they are a smoker?	
5	I'm wondering if there is information regarding job description requirements in regards to food allergens.	
4	Can I ask about citizenship in an interview?	
8	We have interviewed candidates for an open office manager position and the candidate only provided two references with application. One is an internal person and the other is the representative from the temp service she was working for. We are very curious about gathering more information about her previous work experience and contacting previous managers, supervisors, coworkers. We are wondering what would be the best way to go about this? They have signed a release when they signed the application and are wondering I there are best practices or acceptable ways to drill down into a candidates past employment?	
5	Position posted internally 2 internal candidates one was hired and one was not interviewed at all. Position posted on 9.1.16 Appl A applied 10.16 and spoken to in Nov	
1	We have an employee who we terminated for failure to report abuse. We provide care to the elderly and this employee was aware of the state requirement to and she still reported the abuse late. She was very upset when she was fired. She's not eligible for rehire. For some reason she continues to apply for positions. One of our HR assistants is asking if we can't simply notify her that she's not rehirable so she will stop applying. We notify all applicants of their status through post cards. We simply select the option that another candidate was selected. Do you think we should let her know she's not rehirable? I think we should just continue sending our standard responses.	
2	Is there a new regulations under recruitment advertisement regarding EEO/AA employment and required statement?	
5	A candidate tested positive for marijuana in her pre employment drug screen. Our policy says all new hires must test negative to be employed. How should we handle?	
5	With Ban the Box policies in place and other updated labor laws. Is there a recommended employment application template for the following states: CA, NYC, NJ, MA, PA, NV, GA	
8	HI: for the I9 form, we have been keeping all the forms for years. We are only required to keep for 3 years from date of hire right? So we just destroy them after 3 years? If someone terminated under 3 years we have to keep it for 3 years after thier date of termination, corrct? Is there any benefit (or risk) to keeping all the history for more than that time? Also, is it okay to keep another copy in the personnel file? We also keep a separate binder.	
8	In regards to I-9 forms and expired documents, we allowed the employee up to the three days to provide the work authorization and today is the 4th day. Do we terminate or do we just not schedule them until they bring in their authorization?	
6	Via phone: Volunteers. We are a staffing company. We have a client, the city of Las Vegas for whom we normally do staffing and they want volunteers. They are telling us they don't want to pay them but they want to give them a $1000 a month for living expenses and via our payroll, and then an additional $1000 at the end of the year. We are a California employer and my first instinct is that this wouldn't be legal, but I wanted to see if there might be different laws for government entities. In a meeting from 10am to 11am PST	
5	Can I add/ask in a Job Description or job posting "Good eyesight and normal hearing for diagnostics and troubleshooting equipment"?	
8	Director, Marketing vs Marketing Director... Is there a standard difference in the meaning of these two titles?	
6	F/U: We are implementing a new drug testing policy. We usually do not drug test unless there is suspicion. We have them sign a drug and alcohol policy upon hire. We are trying to implement applicant testing. Should I have them sign an acknowledgement other than what they get at the clinic and upon hire?	
2	We have new employees fill out a background check release form upon hire. Can we have existing employees who may have been hired prior to these release forms being used, fill one out as well? It would be used for the same purposes - ex: consumer reports or investigative consumer reports. Thank you.	
6	We would like to do credit and background checks on employees prior to offering them a position with the company. We have a small statement on our application that they are subject to this however I am not sure just that is adequate. I may have inquired about this previously but I do not have the response.	
2	New Hire Forms Hi there - I have two questions: 1. Is it mandatory for new hires to complete a W4? And if not, do they still have to fill out the DE4 and receive the DE34=5 notice? 2. Are all of the state forms and resources in the new-hire toolkit mandatory for those states?	
2	What new hire documents must an employer in Minnesota have employees sign?	
4	We want to call references - can we ask the previous employer if the person has worked on specific machines?	
4	I have received several questions from our clients inquiring about their ability to ask specific questions during the phone screen interview in regards to the applicants driving record. For example, the managers would like to ask if they have a driving record to explain the occurrences and how many points? They would like to ask if the applicant has ever had a DUI? Is this okay from an employment practices liability standpoint?	
3	Candidate's background check returned with a misdemeanor conviction for disturbing the peace/fighting in 2011. How does the employer consider this when determining if the employer will hire the candidate?	
5	Can I hire someone as an employee who is not a US citizen but is here on a sponsorship?	
1	The question is regarding hiring. We are interviewing someone for a position. It is going well. We have a college who worked with the candidate so we asked her thoughts about her experience working with him. She had a very negative response. We want to bring this up to the candidate but not sure how specific we can be.	
2	Am I allowed to have new employees complete new hire paperwork after they have accepted the offer letter but prior to their first working day? Which forms am I not allowed to have them complete prior to their first working day? Also, do we have to pay employees to fill out their new hire paperwork if they complete their paperwork prior to their first working day?	
6	Hello- My question is regarding the new Background check guidelines. We run a children's activity center which also offers before and after school care. Do our employee's that transport these children to and from school need to be fingerprinted, as this new legislation indicates? We are not a public school, we offer care before and after school. Our drivers are not licensed care providers-they are doing the transportation from the child's school to our facility.	
7	I am hiring a minor who has their GED and in the state of WA he will have to have his parents fill out a work permit for the summer. What does that look like for when school started if he is a minor but done with school?	
8	Question on Social Security # Good morning, This potential employee is presenting an I-551 stamp on his passport showing him as a legal U.S. resident and authorized to work, however, he is not bringing a social security card nor he's obtained a social security number yet because it's in process. According to the USCIS information, he can continue to work and we can wait on the social number to come. This is raising concerns about our company issuing payment to him without a social security number and then facing problems with the IRS. Please advise. Thank you.

6	We have a residential program that requires 24 hour staffing. We are always short staffed and in hiring mode. We utilize temp services to fill in but that still does not fill the gap. What are some ways we can keep the hiring process going while working through being short staffed?	
3	My question is in regards to Background Checks. Currently we offer the position to the individual contingent upon the success full completion of the background check. We normally have the individual fill out the background check release when they come in to fill out their new hire documents. The issue is that sometimes the background checks are not fully completed by the time the person has started their jobs and in some cases lately, I have had to rescind offers based on the individual's background. Is there a better time during the hiring process that we can conduct the background check? Is it ok to have the person fill out background check paperwork at the on site interview?	
6	We understand that the I-9 section 2 must be completed quickly and we are getting different information on what "business days" means. In the M-274 handbook it says three business days (we are open 7 days a week).

8	Issue with an applicant and negative info on internet and newspaper. Can we not move forward with an interview? The mayor reached out all of our first selected individuals and made contact with this individual. The individual did inform the mayor during the phone call that we should ignore information on the internet about him. Upon review of the internet, we came across information that concerns us. This position is one of leader for a specific community group and it's very concerning.	
8	Matt Weis Dawson Insurance mattw@dawsonins.com #701-306-3791 It's a situation there is a company that used hydrogen chloride. There was a concern that Employees had been over exposed to that. Employees stirred up right not. Filed workers comp claims and got most of the people tested.Some employees are concerned that having a Workers Comp claim will limit future employment. ADA protects? and different sate laws. I'm looking for state laws in North Dakota that protect employees from future. We are trying how to figure out how to calm the situation down. What can I provide the employer that would put the employee's at ease?	
6	We had a drug test come back positive for marijuana. We would like to rescind the offer. Can we deny employment to an employee who tests positive even though its legal in CA?	
3	We run background checks on candidates during the hiring process that include criminal and credit checks as a part of obtaining a security clearance for our customer sites. Are we able to share the results of the checks with our managers?	
7	New employee starts on Monday. He let us know that his EAD will expire later this month. He was told by immigration that he would be issued a green card back in March and that it could take 3 months. He hasn't received anything yet. Can we have him start working?	
8	I am the HR manager. I report to the CFO/COO. Recently, my manager requested that I run all compliance concerns by them before making my own decision. I have not given my manager reason for this to be necessary due to I have not made a bad hiring decision based upon the background screening in the past. We had a candidate who had something come back on their background. I showed my manager and stated my concerns. My manager then called the employee who would be the candidates supervisor and told them what was on the background and then ask them to reach out to the candidate to see if they would be honest about the info. This is a two part question. 1-Should I be sharing the information or results with the CFO/COO and 2-should the information or results be shared with a supervisor or manager. I have always made it good practice never to share with the supervisor or manager the information that was found in these reports. This is confidential information that should not be shared	
6	We are a temporary staffing firm. I was wondering, one of our clients is requesting that we provide I-9 documents for temps on assignment. We collect that information upon hire with our company. They are asking for the I-9s and residency status. Because we are employer of record I just want to make sure we can do that.	
2	We also have a department hiring multiple new hires, and they want to have one new hired in as a temp to hire. I'm concern about having one person being treated differently. Are there any compliance issues?	
1	I have an employee that signed a form stating we could run a DMV check. We hired her to be a heavy equipment operator. When we processed her DMV record she has a suspended license. Out insurance isn't going to cover someone with a suspended license. Can I ask her for details about the nature of the suspended license?	
6	I was reviewing your latest email regarding the San Francisco ban on requesting salary information. Can we ask a prospective employee what their salary expectations are? We currently do not have a location in San Francisco, but we do have locations in the Sacramento area and anticipate that this type of legislation will become the norm.	
8	We have a client who is in the CyberSecurity business (creation and the sale of cyber security software) and they would like to see if they can use polygraph for their job interview, with the consent of the employee stating it is ok? Can you please advise and confirm on the complications involved?	
8	Seeking more detailed information regarding J-1 visas. I would like to speak with someone to get some guidance. A candidate is a J-1 visa holder. J-1 visas are usually sponsored, correct? If we are not the sponsor, can we employ the candidate? The interviewer asked if the candidate was legally allowed to work in the US and it is unclear if the answer is yes or no. Would they need a need special documentation?	
7	We have offered a job to someone, and when we were scheduling a time for new hire paperwork it was brought to my attention from someone who is family with this person that he got ticketed in another state a few years ago for possession of drug paraphernalia. I searched their name in that state an there is an active warrant out for failure to appear on the possession charges. When I ran his background check after he did his paperwork it didn't pop because he hasn't actually been convicted since he never went to court. The job offer is contingent on all background screens and drug screens being clean. Can we legally not continue his employment since we know he has an active warrant for possession charges in another state? If the drug charges were on his record we wouldn't be able to hire him because we are an assisted living and can't employee anyone with drug charges.

4	Can the company ask potential hires either during the interview and/or on the application if there is anything that would prevent them from doing the job as described on the job description?	
5	I'm recreating a couple of job descriptions for a laborer and carpenter. We want to add in there the physical demands. I want to keep it somewhat generic. 80% of job will be lifting. Would like to bounce some ideas off of someone. I don't want to go into a laundry list (sit, stand, kneel, crawl). Can it be a summary?	
5	A contractor had a name change since the last time they worked for us. We received a W-9 that reflects the new name. Should we request to see an updated social security card?	
7	Employee started in 2015 and was laid off 7/2017, less than a month ago. He was one of our shippers. The person we kept is going on vacation and we want to offer the laid off employee an opportunity to come back and cover the vacation time. We don't how to classify him as an employee or how to pay him? Do we fill out all the new hire paper work again, including informing the state?	
8	I'm looking for best practices when it comes to responding to job applicants who were not selected. We care about the humans we're interacting with and we want to make a good impression to the candidate and also be crisp and legally protective to the company. I'd like to set up a range of responses from "the position has been filled" email to applicants who had a phone interview, to a more personalized, thank you for coming in to meet me e-mail for those dropped after the first interview, to a personal phone call to a candidate who made it through peer interviews and references but still was not selected. We'd like to put a personal touch on it, but also I'm aware that something like a phone call opens us up to questions etc. Best practices, who should be the one communicating- HR or the line manager (my company wants HR to do it)? I have some rejection form letters already, but advice on how to handle a personal phone call rejection would be very helpful too.

3	Hello, Do you possibly have recommendations for a background search company? We're wanting to utilize for our new hire process and we thought we could streamline a bit by using a service for the drivers license and criminal background checks.	
6	Our insurance policy does not allow us to hire drivers that are younger than 21 yrs. How can we recruit for drivers with this age limitation without discriminating? Also, we try to avoid hiring employees under the age of 21 because some of our positions require physical strength to carry ladders and tools at the same time that can be in excess of 80 lbs. How can we hire for that without discriminating? How should we best recruit?

5	I have an employee we made an offer to. Nonexempt maintenance. He would like to work full time 35-40 hours per week. I am ok with that but what do I need to do?

8	Employer in GA. We have an applicant for a front desk (receptionist) role who has an misdemeanor assault and battery conviction from 2014. We have sent her the pre-adverse action letter this week. The role that this person has applied for is patient facing, can be stressful, working as a single front desk person. I am not inclined to move forward with this person, if the information is correct. We do not have a formal process for adjudicating adverse criminal reports at this time. What would be an appropriate course of action from this point? 1) If there is an error on the report, we'll obviously allow for that to be corrected. 2) No error on report - should I call the candidate and find out the circumstances of the incident? (an interactive discussion) 3) some other recommendation

8	How do you recommend we decline candidates if we are not in the position to sponsor their specific type of visa? For example, premium processing for H1B visas has been suspended and we cannot wait the 6-8 months for approval and subsequent hiring of the employee. We need someone immediately. Is it okay to be this honest? Another possible scenario is we simply do not have the budget for the legal expense. Just looking for guidance on appropriate wording.	
6	We are hiring our first Director level position and will be offering more vacation (PTO) than what our handbook states. Is there any special verbiage I can use.in the offer letter? ie special condition?	
3	Do you have a sample letter to rescind an offer? We ran a background check on a candidate post-offer. The results could not confirm his social security number. The background check vendor told us there would be an expense for each international check. We would like to rescind the offer.	
1	I manage a small law firm. I told a candidate I would like to offer her the receptionist job, and asked when she would be available to start. She said 2 weeks. So I sent her an offer letter with a start date in two weeks' time. Now she is asking if she can extend it out another week (she didn't sign it yet). I don't want to wait this long, and it makes me feel like she is perhaps waiting for a better offer. Can I just withdraw the offer letter at this point, or do I have to tell her no, 2 weeks only, first?

7	I've read through the guidelines for Employment of a Minor but still wish to clarify a couple items. We currently have a 17 year old that is participating in a school/work program where he volunteers in our Body Shop as a helper. We are a car dealership. He volunteers for 2 hours and then we would like to hire him to work an additional 2-3 hours. Does he need to provide an Employment Certificate? We have a completed application from him and a copy of his drivers license. Are there any other restrictions that we would need to adhere to?

6	We are in the middle of an EDD audit and one of the things being reviewed is employee's versus contractors. We are a publishing company and we generally buy manuscripts from former teachers and publish them. We do have contractors with those people and the contracts says that they are signing all rights to the books over to us. We handle copyright issues, we can resell for royalties, etc. The EDD auditor is leaning towards classifying those people like employees and we have never treated them that way and we have paid them through A/P on a 1099 basis. Additionally, in many cases we are not their sole source of income, they write books for other people. The auditor seems to think there is an industry specific guidance that makes these individuals more likely to be employees because they have given away the rights to their content. Have you seen anything on this?	
8	Peppermint Ridge Dear ThinkHR, We have facility manager opening internally. Our job description for this position states qualifications with experience in a lead staff position, or supervisory experience preferred. We had three employees apply, two of which are lead staff since 2015 and the other is caregiver. After interviewing all three, the committee feels the employee without the supervisory experience is the best candidate. I feel the employee without supervisory experience should not be considered. I feel the other two candidates could file a grievance over the fact we choose a candidate with less experience. All three candidates had a strong interview. I'm looking for your advice on this matter. Many thanks Regards, Annette Vigil Administrative Services Manager [2011PR logo horiz] 825 Magnolia Avenue Corona, CA 92879 Phone: (951) 273-7320 Direct Line: (951) 273-7330 Fax: (951) 737-0726 www.PeppermintRidge.org Want to help The Ridge?

8	We're a non-profit. Our executive director left and an offer was made to an interim by our board of directors without my knowledge for a start date of 1/1. For some reason, they are unwilling to give me a copy of the employment agreement and I have concerns about that they have offered that I'm unaware of such as the payroll cycle, if it is an outdated agreement, whether it includes California-specific language, etc. They are only emailing me some details. They also made him a more generous benefit offer. They offered 100% benefits for this employee only while everyone else is offered med 90%, dental 50%. Do I need to be concerned about this?	
8	Can an employer legally require employees to take an eye examination, post-hire, to determine whether they need corrective lenses in order to perform their job properly? The company would bring a doctor into the office to perform the examination and those who do not have vision insurance to cover the care would be taken care of by the company.	
3	We were a processing background check for a potential candidate. The manager decided to go another direction. However the candidate feels it is due to the results. They are asking for a letter.

We want the client to sign something that states that the applicant does not meet our requirement for hire, and that if the client hires them they release from (attached). Please take a look at the attached letter and see if it would help to reduce our risk should the client opt to hire an applicant with a barrier level offense.

2	A private employer owns and runs a manufacturing plant in New Jersey with union employees. They also own other non-union plants and offer a benefit plan to non-union employees. They pay for union benefits for the union employees. They need to hire about 16 employees in New Jersey but want to be able to offer them a higher pay rate if they forgo the union (hire on as non-union), basically giving them a choice of being a union employee at a certain pay rate with union benefits OR being non-union with a higher pay rate and the non-union company benefits. What are the implications of doing this in New Jersey?

The client is now concern this may be a future WC issue. Our employee made not mention of any issues with her wrists or ask for any accommodation.

Is there a concern if we choose to move forward with the hire?

8	We had an individual who applied to the company recently who worked for us previously. A hiring manager reached out to me and said we'd like to make an offer. I told them I would need to look into it b/c it was a rehire. I did some research and found out the individual that was terminated based on things related to insubordination, etc. I also interviewed people who had worked with her and based on all the evidence decided the person was not a good fit. We compiled the information and decided not to offer. I emailed the hiring manager letting them know and to provide me with the candidate's information. The hiring manager cc'd the individual on the email accidentally saying they weren't going to pursue. We tried to recall the email unsuccessfully. The email basically just shows that the manager wanted to hire her and we made a decision not to, it didn't include any details on why because I had that conversation verbally. What should we do at this point?	
2	I just called and spoke with Rachel. Do I need her fill out a new I-9 and new W-4 and all new paper work? Or can I use what I have from the past?

1	We extended an employment offer to an applicant and she was scheduled to start on Tuesday, 8/15. She emailed us on 8/15 to state she had been in a car accident and was in the hospital. She didn't respond to any emails or phone calls until today, 8/17, and stated her daughter was still in the hospital and she didn't know when she would be released. The applicant hasn't returned phone calls despite her manager requesting she do so. Because it doesn't seem like she is being completely honest with us, we would like to rescind the job offer. Is this legal to do in California and what are the potential risks? Thanks! Lisa Gill 925-296-3143

Do we legally have to post that job internally, or can we just promote him? Although this employee is in our Omaha terminal, we have terminals in 3 different states (CO, MO, and NE).	
7	We have a summer intern whose last day is today. He is unpaid and on an educational stipend. We worked with THR to get that all straight at the beginning of the internship. We want to offer him another internship next summer, but this time pay him by the hour instead. What are some of the things we should be thinking about?

Is that wrong to ask?	
6	We have a union here. We are required to post jobs when they are available. We posted for tutor when we had one opening. During the course of the interview process, two other positions became available. We selected three candidates through the one posting. I would like to get a second opinion on the wording in the contract and see if we are in compliance.	
8	Job descriptions. I'm updating format and I wanted your opinion on adding this to the bottom of the job descriptions. "Company reserves right to alter and change this job description at anytime without notice." Are there any kind of ramifications if doing this? We have employees in 10 other states.

Two of the charges the candidate indicated being aware of on his application, stating he had pending charges for OWI. However, the background check revealed the candidate also has a pending charge for possession of a narcotic (misdemeanor offense). We are wondering if we still need to move forward with the candidate or if we would be able to rescind the offer? We would like to rescind the offer at this time and let the candidate know they can reapply once the charges have been finalized. Would be any issues with doing that?

6	We are a staffing firm and most of our clients do not sponsor individuals who are here on visas. How should we respond to candidates who require sponsorship?

8	Our intention was to include the following 90 day probationary period verbiage on a new hire's employee agreement - "On the first day you report to work, you will begin an Introductory Period to last 90 calendar days. This Introductory Period will be a time for learning about your fellow employees, your manager and the tasks involved in your job position. We expect you will also become familiar with other relevant information about the Community Foundation of Greater Dubuque. Your department manager will work closely with you on all aspects of your training, understanding and responsibilities during this introductory period. The Introductory Period is 90 calendar days for all new employees. By completing this introductory period, an employee is not guaranteed continued employment for any term as it is always "at-will" and subject to various conditions." However, it was not included and she has been here a little over a week. Are we able to do an addendum to her employee agreement?	
1	About a year ago a manager resigned and we were happy because she was not a good fit. She kept coming back and was intimidating staff. We now have an opening in the department and her daughter applied. We do not want the daughter. It is just too incestuous.

The new hire was one of four young women who came into the store and became verbally violent with staff. They then went outside and started throwing and breaking pumpkins that were outside as part of a Halloween display. Can we let the new hire go?	
5	Candidate applied for position, company is not interested in employment with individuals affiliated in this family from a prior employee.	
8	Please see the question below from our client SASB: Are either of you familiar with E-Verify and whether we need to be compliant with that to work with contractors? We have worked with contractors before, and this is the first time we have been asked about E-Verify. While I understand employees need to have I-9s, not so sure about contractors. I just heard back from Jeff (the contractor) and he said he talked to a lawyer and Columbia and they said that we need to be an E-verify employer to sign a SOW with a contractor. Are we able to comply with the E-verify requirements? I realize that it adds some work to the process of onboarding and not sure how it was not redundant for the I-9. When you have a chance within the next week, please tell me how I should proceed because it seems like this might be a hurdle and not sure what the best next step is. Thank you!	
7	We do telefundraising - professional solicitors, registered with the States, some of which have requirements around financial crime prohibitions on hires. We had a prospective employee who applied. He answered yes to felony/misdemeanor question. Because you answered yes, we need to run a background check. We just need to know if it is a financial crime. We told him that and he agreed. He emailed the next day that he intends ot file a lawsuit because we insisted on discussing his misdemeanor during his interview. He used to work for a law firm that specializes in employment discrimination. I responded and agree to hire him and treated it as a misunderstanding. He sent a more threatening letter. I am not sure we should respond again? This individual is in New York, New York.	
6	Hello- We are a kids center looking to recruit interns for our "junior coaching" positions. These will be positions that are unpaid- for young students to gain experience and hopefully, once they reach the correct age, become employees of the company. Is there a minimum age for these types of internship opportunities?	
1	Can an employer offer a sign-on bonus to a new employee but require that they pay it back, or a portion of it, if they separate before X number of months? We have a candidate we want to make an offer to. Her position will require a lot of travel so she'll need a laptop which she does not have. Generally we do not offer laptops to new employees but we're considering offering a sign-on that she can use towards purchasing a laptop. This will be her's, we just want to be able to collect the rest of the bonus if she terminated before the amount is paid off. Can we do that?	
0	When interviewing candidates can we ask the following questions? Do you have transportation to and from work? Have you ever used a backpack vacuum? If not, would you like to see one or I can describe it to you. To both, would you have any reservations/concerns about using one of these?

6	Our teachers used to be paid on a salary basis because he had them classified as exempt. We have had to reclassify them to nonexempt and they are paid on an hourly basis. Our principal wants the language on their contracts to reference a salary but I'm weary about it because their hours fluctuate and we do not pay on a salary basis. What are you thoughts on wording?	
8	If a candidate provides references during an employment opportunity, but we do not offer the employee the job at that time, and we then consider the candidate for another open position a year later, can we use the references they provided to us previously, or do we need to ask for new references since it had been one year since the candidate provided the references to us?

8	We are based in RI. We are a staffing company and a percentage of our temps are put on assignment in Massachusetts. On our application we ask about convictions. I know there is controversy in both states. We have justified this in RI because when they come into interview, they are an employee for Greysmith. We consider the first interview (by phone) and do not discuss criminal history. In the first in person interview they fill everything out and become an employee. The application is filled out in the in-person meeting. They fill out all of the paperwork first then they meet with the recruiter. They sign a background check form. If on the form they say they have had the conviction and if the conviction is an issue, we start the adverse/pre-adverse process. We have different levels of background checks but everyone goes the same initial background check. Some clients require drug screens and some don't.

Now Im being told that one employee had been demoted right before they were bought by Ross (supervisor to technician). His pay was correct, but his title was incorrect. Even the offer letter reflects the supervisor title. Now the general manager is saying that he isnt a supervisor. They would like to meet with him to correct his job title, nothing else needs to be changed.	
7	We have someone who worked at one location, then quit. Then they went to another location and worked for a while. He wants to work at one location for the winter and another for the summer. We want to retain him and are okay with him working full time for parts of the year. How would/could we handle this? Would we terminate him and then rehire him?

Do you have or have you ever had any injuries to your back, knee, shoulder? Or would this open him up for a lawsuit of some kind due to privacy issues? Any suggestions you can give would be greatly appreciated. Please respond to Michele Bolser - mbolser@gswins.com Thank you.	
3	We use a temporary staffing agency to complement our staffing levels. Since we are a financial institution our background check guidelines are stricter than those of the agency we use.

8	Good morning........................... We have a potential new employee (actually he is returning after being gone for a couple of years). Attached are the two pieces of ID he is presenting. The top card is one we are not familiar with. Is this a valid piece of ID? Also, on this card it shows an expiration date of 12-3-17. If this is a valid piece of ID, should we ask for another piece of ID before 12-3-17? The second card I covered over the SSN (for security). We have not seen a card like this before. It is a Social Security card but with the added phrase of "VALID FOR WORK ONLY WITH DHS AUTHORIZATION". Is this acceptable ID? Thank you!

6	I have an employee that we hired as a temp for 6 months (no benefit) If I want to turn them into a full time employee, do I have to wait a certain amount of time? What is the gap after the 6 months I have to hire them on full time without having to pay a penalty ? What is the penalty?

8	Hello, after a person is hired, we provide the individual with a form to fill out, which includes information such as "emergency contacts," "professional license and associations," and "dependent's names." This form includes a page on EEO information about the employee. This page is to be filled out on a voluntary basis, and it is stapled to the rest of the form. At the top of this EEO page, it clearly states that the information is requested for reporting purposes only and that it will not be retained in the employee's personnel file or used in any way which could adversely affect the individual's employment, compensation, promotion, etc. To be honest with you, I probably read this information when I was hired and had forgotten about it. Meanwhile, we have been keeping this information in the employees' files. I suppose because no one else noticed, and because the page is stapled to the rest of the document. Would you know if we are required to destroy this information?, or can we delete this statement and leave it in the employee personnel files? I know that we enter the information given to us into our payroll software, if it's given to us.

1	Question on retracting an offer... We have a manager candidate who is pregnant. She told us early on that she was pregnant and we discussed that we were opening to working with her, even though she is expected to go on LOA soon after she starts working . After the VP of Nursing, Director of HR, and HR specialist have had multiple conversations with her over negotiations, we came to an agreed upon rate and benefits package. We have just sent her the official offer letter, and now she is requesting to negotiate additional time off to a level that only our executive team have. She was aware of our current PTO policy for her level position, prior to the offer letter. At this point we have found that it is becoming too difficult to work with her. How can we retract the offer without legal implications due to her pregnancy?

3	We are a Restaurant Management Company. One of our sites has a candidate and received a phone call that the candidate was a registered sex offender.

8	Hello, I have a few questions regarding 1-9 Form completion. A) If current owners who are on the payroll do not have 1-9 forms on file, are we required to have one completed? If so, the Employer Signature date would not be within the three days of employment start date. Would this be an issue? B) We employ across the country and often have newly hired employees who are offered employment and never come to the business office.Therefore all on-boarding paper work is completed electronically. In this scenario are photocopies of their identification and an electronically signed 1-9 form acceptable? C) If we conduct interviews and make employment offers via any type of electronic process such as skipe, facetime, or a WEBX meeting can we view eligibility documents during this process and would that be acceptable as the documents being "Physically" presented to the Employer Representative? D) In the past we have taken photocopies of identification and attached to the 1-9 forms. Starting with this New Year can we change this process and no longer keep copies? How would that reflect the older 1-9 forms on file? Thank you, Barbara	
6	We just recently implemented an affirmative action plan and are considered a government contractor. We haven't hired anyone yet under our affirmative action plan and I had a question. I had read somewhere that government contractors subject to VEVRAA were required to post all job openings for the public. We will now have our first opening since creating our AAP and possibly had a candidate that we have already interviewed in the past. So would we not be able to possibly just make an offer, we would have to advertise our job opening?

6	Unregistered User: Grand Army LLC Joey Ellis 443-466-9416 joey@grandarmy.com What is the proper onboarding of temp employees versus contractors. There are a few people we just brought on to the Justworks system that are interns. I want to make sure we are entering them into the system properly. Last time I talked to Justworks they said interns are usually classified as temporary employees. I have I-9's for them and have submitted payroll for them. Once the I-9's have been submitted, there are a couple of people who did not give me their passport in time. We pay a day rate for them. We don't track hours here. Payroll in arrears There are some people who work on project basis, come in if they want to, their hours are not picked by us. Independent contractors.	
1	A new hire's EAD card has expired but she's in the process of getting her Green Card. Can we accept a receipt from the employee showing her green card is in the process? Would this satisfy for I-9 purposes? We thought a letter from her attorney may help support this.

5	What are the, if any, legal pitfalls with requiring a candidate to take a personality assessment (or management style assessment) prior to hire? Thanks. Sheila	
0	do you answe questions about I-9? I wanted to know what is face value when you are looking at a document. I may be being too particular about this, but I want to make sure I have a full understanding of what they mean by face value	
6	When we do interviews we send out an rejection email. When we have people that reach out to us to ask why they were not hired what can we say?	
0	Thank you Renee, this is helpful. To understand more, what is the point of background checks that companies do? For example, could you not hire someone due to a felony being on their record if you did background checks and it not be considered discriminatory? Also, do you have to do background checks across the whole company if you do or can you select certain positions to do them for?	
7	Chloe Chang, a new PIHRA member, working at American Haval, chloe.chang1014@gmail.com, 626-228-5642 Recruiting a candidate who works at Ford on the autonomous driving team. He has a 3 year retention bonus he would have to pay back if he accepts our position. He is asking our company to pay the $60,000 plus taxes as a negotiation for accepting our offer. I'm looking for guidance on how to do that and in general, does this sound normal? Should we make the payment directly to Ford?	
8	In the state of NJ is there any reason why a company cannot call the 90-day introductory period a "probationary" period?	
8	Hi Renee: It was a pleasure speaking with you today. I am eager to see what ThinkHR sends over and what they come up with in the future to add to the recruiting toolkit. Here is a sample of what I currently use, which can be modified based upon the position or the company. (I removed our company logo and name and a few other personalized areas- youll get the general idea without those things!) The second attachment is an older version I created- your team may want to see both as a springboard for ideas and designing something better! Thanks.	
4	Is New Jersey a ban the box state? Is it recommended to still ask about convictions if it is not?	
2	We have a standard practice that at the time of hire, employees complete a new hire packet. Currently the practice is, if an employee completed a new hire packet and the abandons the job, he/she has 30 days to return to work without having to complete a new hire packet all over again. If the employee is inactive for more than 31 days, at that point the employee would need to complete a new hire packet all over again. Because there is a high turnover and employees are seasonal, what is the suggested timeframe we have before the employees need to complete new hire documentation? Our policies have stated 30 days but we would like to know if this time can be extended to possibly 60 or 90 days?	
5	Can we hire an employee with a green card?	
8	In our area and in manufacturing in general most employers opt to use a staffing agency to bring on production workers. My question is, is there a time limit regarding the amount of months/years that a person can be utilized under the staffing agency? Some of our neighboring factories will go out 1 year, 18 months, or even sometimes 2 years. We would like to be compliant in this area.	
6	Good Morning, We have made a verbal offer to an applicant. Based on information we have discovered since we made the offer, we may want to rescind the offer. Are there any legal implications in rescinding ? Do we need to disclose the information that caused us to rescind ? Thank you for your help.	
5	My question is about entering in an hourly employee in our payroll system. Trying to figure out if he's a 1099 or w-2 employee? and payroll deduction for taxes.	
3	We have a location in GA and one of our applicants had a background check come back with a chage from 2008 for aggravated stalking and then a misdemeanor charge for domestic violence in 2015. We will not consider the charge that was 7 years ago. However, should we consider a misdemeanor charge be GA law?	
3	We're thinking of starting background checks for all office employees in the state of Georgia. Can we do that? Is there anything we should know about before starting this process?	
7	We hired an employee, his first day of work was Monday. For some reason, our usual hiring practice was not followed. He did not complete a job application so I have nothing to confirm a statement of ever being convicted of a crime, nor did he authorize a background check. For some reason the hiring manager did a search of public records on him and found he's a convicted sex offender and we want to terminate. The news has spread. I'm upset with how this was handled and not sure why they choose to do a search. Can we terminate?	
0	I have not seen any Candidate Evaluation Forms on your Recruiting Toolkit. Do you have any templates that you can share that would be used to evaluate job candidates?	
0	We are revamping our employee application and would like to discuss it with you if the following should be included on an application. Have you ever been convicted of a crime? Do you have a driver's license what is your mode of transportation? Have you ever been in the armed forces are you now a member of the national guard?	
6	We are a healthcare provider and employee physicians which are hired with employment contracts. There is no law that states we should have them fill out applications for those with employment contracts? Our regular employees fill out applications just not these professionals.	
5	Where can an employer stay abreast of industry related hiring trends; and employer feedback about those trends. Domestic and Global. Does PIHRA have resources for updates to state laws.	
8	I'm an account manager at Parr3 LLC and have a client looking to hire a few interns in Atlanta, Georgia. The company is a record label, publishing company, and creative agency (primarily working in the music business). They're planning to offer the interns $25/week as a 'stipend', but they will otherwise be unpaid. I'm curious what other HR implications we need to consider, documentation we need to collect from the interns, etc. as well as any restrictions or regulations we need to be mindful of. Any resources or advice would be very helpful.	
3	In regards to reference checks, we think references should not be completed until after a verbal offer is made. Is that best practice?	
8	Follow up to previous issue: The employment contract states that it is at will employment and that the employee is in a 30-day probationary period. It states that the employer may end the employment relationship but it says nothing about the employee's ability to end the employment relationship. It states that the employee will be employed for a 30-day period and at the end of 30 days the company will make a decision of whether to extend the employment relationship. Isnt that setting a contract?	
1	We acquired a company that does health screens on their candidates. The candidate has come back with high blood pressure. US Health Works wants to test her again in a week. Manufacturing roles for optical lenses. Can we have her start work in the meantime?	
2	I wanted to do a quick audit on my own processes. What are the required notices for employees in California?	
8	We have a psychological practice that is hiring nurse practitioners. Are there legal employment language templates that can be included into the employment agreement for a nurse practitioner that says there duties are terminated immediately should the primary licensed doctor become deceased and is no longer able to supervise the practitioner activities. Do you also have any checklist or protocol for the practice that is legally obligated to maintain records and operations of the patients in the same practice where the one and only primary doctor becomes deceased? Thank you.	
4	Can we ask someone if they have open worker's comp claims in an interview? Can we ask them if they have any injuries?	
5	We are bringing on an employee who will be hired through a PEO as the employee is in Canada. Theyll act as the employer. We just need to provide an offer letter. We want to talk about ideas for the offer letter.

7	We would like to make an employment offer to a candidate that is currently in the US as a student and they have a work permit. Is there a way to verify the permit and can we do that before making the offer? The permit will expire in the spring. He says he can renew for 2 years. Can we verify that as well?	
8	Our HQ is based in Fairfax, VA. We have an employee working on one of our contracts in California. I was told that we have to apply/submit an application to pay for the state required disability insurance. I've tried going on line to register and calling their 1-800 number but have been unsuccessful in getting assistance. Can you provide some assistance on whether the employer is required to pay for the state disability and how I can register? Thank you.	
7	We ran a background check following a contingent offer and the results came back with a conviction of attempted murder back in 2005. He served 5 years in prison. Can we rescind the offer? He will be working in a warehouse that's hot with lots of people. We're concerned about his violent past.

However, this client would like to know exactly what wording should be included in offer letter so that if at the end of a suggested three year period, the requirements are not met and the termination of continued employment is necessary.

8	If an organization in Texas was working towards an acquisition in NY, NJ and CT (Tri State) area, when would be the best time to complete background checks on the incoming employees from acquired company? Is it at the time of close, or at the time they cut over on payroll which is the start of the new calendar year? The current policy is that a background check (criminal, social search, education and employment verification) is completed before start date. But in this case where they are currently employed by target, could we potentially wait until the cut over in January to run checks? Does it depend what date we use as their official date of hire with our organization?

7	We have a candidate that we would like to hire. He stated that he has an EAD and that once that expires he will be able to work under a student status.

8	A religious non-profit has 75 total employees. As part of its services, it operates a battered women's shelter. Approximately 13 employees work at the shelter, providing 24 hour care for residents. The director would like to only hire women, the rationale being that 1) the women have had traumatic experiences with men and having men on staff may make the them uncomfortable and 2) women staff better relate to the women residents. The employer has not been able to find any government regulation, professional standard, best practice, etc. to support this. The employer is concerned that this may lead to exposure to gender discrimination claims from male applicants. Could this be the case and/or is there some guidance that would help clarify this?

4	We use an online employment information form that is provided to us by a third party. We also have applicants complete a hard copy employment application. Can we use only the electronic version rather than having applicants duplicate their efforts? The online form asks about criminal convictions for felonies, and then asks if the applicant has been convicted of any crime. Is it permissible for us to ask about any crime?

We have been reminding her for the last 4 months and she has indicated she has applied for a new one but still does not have it. Ive never had this happen before so have been doing some research and everything I found said we had to terminate as soon as it expires and can rehire when she gets the new one. EXCEPT for the article in the link below which states there is an automatic 6-month grace period now. The article states it was to go into effect 1/17/17. I cant find anything that confirms that or changes it. http://www.belaborthepoint.com/2016/11/form-i-9-alert-new-rule-will-automatically-extend-expiring-ead/	
8	We recently went to a job fair (college) and were interviewing for sales positions. Potential applicants were asked to take a "sales" test by Randy Schwantz - an author and insurance sales professional. Randy's firm's recommendation is that if the applicant does not score over 50 - they should not be considered an ideal candidate. I do not know if this test is actually certified or what the credentials are - but we have been using this as a first indicator. I was very leary about saying in the rejection email anything about the test results and simply came up with a generic we are unable to interview you at this time. We have had someone specially ask -"I appreciate the opportunity nonetheless. I know you must be busy but if you could let me know what aspect(s) of my application led to the denial, I would greatly appreciate it. Every rejection is an opportunity for growth and I simply wish to maximize that growth. " I am hesitant to answer - can you provide some guidance.

1	We have presented a job offer to a candidate and they accepted. They are scheduled to start orientation with us in a week and the president has decided that we should pull the offer and not hire her because he just reviewed her test results and compared her to some of the other candidates and feels that she is not the best choice. She had a full time job and she put in her notice when she accepted our position. What kind if issues could we have if we pull the offer?

6	During phone screens with applicants to our open positions, we ask if they are "legally authorized to work in the US". If they reply yes, we follow up with "do you require sponsorship to work here?". First off, are these questions legal? And secondly, if an applicant responds they just need to transfer the H1B Visa over to us, are we still allowed to inform them that "we are not sponsoring applicants for work visas for this position"? I just want to make sure I'm not going to be sued for discrimination or anything if we decline to move forward with any H1B visa applicants.

8	Pre-employment background screening, in Illinois, came back with charges that were dismissed. The charge is job related in that it was for retail theft. Can we talk to the candidate about this?	
6	Can you provide general guidance on background checks? Can we say that those individuals with convictions of theft and/or violence are a risk to our workplace and we will not hire? We have employees in IA and MO.	
5	Signing bonus - are we required to do any "paperwork" - i.e. promissory note + affidavit? Or is outlining the amount in an offer letter sufficient?	
6	We are looking for a COO and we have one candidate we are going to be sending an offer - the CEO is asking for the W-2s and the candidate is asking why. We're trying to understand what he made, I think. What is the best practice to handle this situation?	
5	Best practice for internal job openings.	
4	An employee did not disclose that they have a condition that causes seizures. They did not put it on their application. Can we ask them why they didn't disclose the disability?

6	No sure if this is something you can answer but: We are hiring a few remote employees in Arkansas and wondering if there and any state specific tax forms we should be providing. Currently we are only providing the federal W4 forms to Arkansas employees.	
5	Drug testing results were positive for Marijuana metabolites for a new hire; today is his/her first day of work. How should employer handle a positive drug test?	
2	It has to do with the deliverable documents to a new hire. There are several discrimination pamphlets, labor codes, sexual harassment for CA. We have remote employees in TX and I want to know do we need to provide the equivalent to that? I'm not sure what all the deliverables are for each state.	
8	Question 1 of 3: Our company recently acquired a small company who have a few different rules to follow so I have been asked to check on a couple things. As they are primarily in UT with over 15 employees (though they have a number of PT remote team members) they must use e-verify in addition to the I9. We know that laws change related to e-verify. For this reason I wonder if there is an updated list that either you have or a web based one I can look into?	
8	Question 2 of 3: Related to the I9 for this small company what are the best practices for the I9 process when there is not manager on site? Has current technologies been integrated into the process at all such as Skype or Facetime? Would simply using a notary public be the best route? What recommendations would you have for this situation?

8	Our executive pastor has moved onto a new position and we are in the process of finding a new pastor, or a operations manager. We are hiring some administrative people. They are wanting to make it clear to these employees that they would have to go through a re-hire process when the EP/OM is hired. One position is a receptionist and the other is a 15 hour a week maintenance employee who would then be eligible for vacation/sick. I'm concerned about having these employees go through the re-hired process.	
1	We are hiring an entry level position case manager. During the first interview she did great. However, during the second interview she disclosed information that raised some concerns, for example, that she moved to the location because she was evicted and that she has three kids, etc. Therefore, our concern is that she may be unreliable or not present when she is here. Furthermore, we are a program that helps families with evictions and now to prevent them. Given that she has been evicted, we wondered if she would be the best person to give advise regarding the process and preventative measures. What types of questions can we ask her going forward?	
7	Is it a law that an employer must post job openings within the company. In the past the president would decide if an employee would be qualified for a position and if not then he would advertise in newspaper/online etc etc. He never hung a notice up anywhere - and there in lays the question, is it a law that he has to?	
7	Several weeks ago we extending an at-will employment offer to a candidate. Just prior to his first day of employment, the candidate notified us of a family medical emergency and asked if we could postpone his first day. We agreed but asked for him to keep in contact every couple of days so that we could be prepared when he is ready to start. The candidate has not met that commitment. Nor has he met his self-imposed commitments to contact us. He has been completely unresponsive or several days overdue in responses. We would like to move forward by looking for another candidate. Is there any state or federal law or regulation providing how to handle this unique scenario? What is the difference between a) rescinding the offer and b) setting a non-negotiable start date and he not showing up for work? What risks lay ahead (unemployment claim, DOL complaint, civil lawsuit, etc.)?	
8	We are interviewing for Class B drivers (bus drivers). Part of the job interview requires the candidate to perform a test drive on one of our busses with the hiring manager. May we ask the candidate to provide us with a copy of their DMV report before we offer them the job?	
3	A candidate was hired in California. When we did the background check nothing came up but when we do a google check, it shows that he is a sex offender. It was past 7 years ago so it didn't show up on the background check. This is not a position where he would work with children.	
8	We get lots of volunteers at our organization, often times they're groups of adults with disabilities through an organization, individuals with disabilities, retirees with restrictions and some with Alzheimer. From my discussions with organizations, they feel the volunteer experience with the humane society could be therapeutic and often we are not aware of a disability until something happens. Certain tasks can be done by employees of any of these types but there are safety concerns as they may be cleaning with chemicals, around animals that are still a risk, carelessness that can scare an animals which could lead to a bite. What are ways I can get ahead of these problems?	
6	We are looking for a QA engineer who can speak Vietnamese and who is a U.S. citizen or has a permanent resident status. We cannot afford to pay (again) the costly expense of getting a green card for someone who is a Vietnam citizen. How do we state that in our job description?

7	We have presented a verbal job offer to a candidate and asked him to provide a response within 24 hours. He said that he is being considered by another company and he wants to see how that plays out, but that he would respond within that time frame. The hiring supervisor now does not want to hire the person because they don't seem that interested in working here. Can we withdraw the offer after I gave him 24 hours to respond?

8	HI there, We currently have one of our founder requesting that we align all start dates with a Sunday date, instead of their actual start date during the following week. They have a tool they use internally to pull headcount reports and if the employee doesn't have a Sunday start date (our first day of the work week), the new employees won't show up to them. I feel like we can't/shouldn't do this, but don't have the knowledge to back this up. Are there legal reasons we can't have a start date be a Sunday but the employees first day of work a Monday or Tuesday?	
6	We recently moved a few employees to 1099 contractor status. I want to know if there are any things I need to be aware of before we make the transition. The employees are in New York.

Please email response to hrm@corporategreen.us...Thank you and have a good day.	
6	We use unpaid interns. I understand it's risky and that we need to do whatever possible to NOT treat them like regular employees.

6	We are considering hiring a commission only employee. The position may be part time or full time, if full time we would offer benefits. Is there anything we should consider with hiring an employee on a commission only basis? We thought about bringing the candidate on as a sub-contractor but training would be involved . Many thanks for your guidance!	
5	New employee submitted an I-94 and foreign passport for their I-9. The I-94 is a print out. Employee told us "they are going electronic now". The print out does not have an expiration date. Do you have any thoughts on what we should do?	
2	I've just been told there is a new Form I-9 going into effect. Is this only to be for new employees going forward or do I need to have everyone complete the new form for 2017?	
2	Hi, I would like to inquire about what forms are necessary for new hires in CA. Especially in the Workers comp realm.

8	We are creating a position description for a Coordinator, who at times will need ton travel locally and area wide for recruitment. We always ask for a valid drivers license due to the driving/car rental, however, the supervisor added "must have a personal vehicle". I'm not sure if this would leave some qualified people out of the pool or if it is even right for us to request it. Would we possibly be leaving a protected class out by requesting they have a personal vehicle for the job?	
8	Are there any requirements that you open a search for a new hire to all internal employees or external candidates. Our client has an executive director opening and would like to hire a candidate from within but isn't sure if they have to open it to all potential internal candidates or open it up to the public as well. They are a non-profit if that affects anything.

I let them know that some of our parts weigh up to 60lbs and they will need to be able to lift that. And some of the parts that weigh that are big like hoods and steel bumpers. Then I ask if they have any restrictions that will not allow them to lift that. I normally get no. But we have had some come in lately that we are concerned about. Just wanted to know if there was a better way to ask.

8	Question on Behalf of a client Cameo Samples: So in going through my HR files I have noticed the update and re-verification (Section 3) of the I9 has not been updated in the files in many years (2005). I have done some research and Im getting mixed answers on the who/what/when/etc needs to be re-verified and updated. Most of my employees use PRC or US Passport (list A item), or DL/SSN (list B & C items). Some employees I have copies of the PRC/DL/SSN and others I dont. I know in the instructions it says the company may or may not take photo copies of these documents. I personally prefer copies so when there are TIN errors on things, and they used a SSN, I can just pull the file. If list B has expired do I need to re-verify the employee, or does this only apply to items in list A & C? Can I ask for copies of the employees who I dont have copies on? (Even though most of my I9s are prior 2002.)

8	An individual had a medical issue and we are hiring staff to help with these issues for the individual until he/she gets better. How should the offer letter be worded? My thought is a standard offer letter and when the employee is no longer needed or there was a performance issue, we could terminate. Or if it is a temporary job, does it have to have a start and end date? If we put a duration, can we evaluate throughout and based on needs for the position employment could we terminate and will that destroy the at-will status? What is the better option?

4	During the interview process we have been asking candidates -- it's not on application, it's more like a screening -- how much they made in their previous job.

Are we allowed to ask that in CA either on the application or verbally in an interview?

And does it make a difference if the candidate doesn't start for a week due to their neglect or our neglect? ie. the employee doesn't bring their acceptable documents until a week later vs. my company did not have a truck available until a week later.

I wanted to reach back out and see if you could assist us with a new process. We are thinking of adding a new disposition code for candidates that have been forwarded to requisitions but have not applied. My Director has asked us to now start moving these candidates into the requisition and disposition them out. We would like to confirm if this would adhere with federal compliance. As for dispositioning the candidates, we currently have a Data Management Technique code we use for when we remove candidates after a set number (such as we are only looking at the first 50 that applied); then the remaining candidates will be removed using the Data Management Technique disposition code. Would we be able to use this for the candidates that have been forwarded to requisitions as well or will be need to create a new code specifically for these candidates? If so, please advise us with an acceptable example. Thank you for your time and assistance!

8	We have a potential new hire we are preparing an offer letter for. This candidate currently lives in CA, but will be relocating to VA for the position we offer. Mike is willing to pay this candidate up to a maximum of $3,000 for relocation assistance. Is there special verbiage that we should use on the offer letter? We were thinking of AI will provide relocation assistance, up to a maximum of $3,000. This is the first time this has come up and we do not currently have a policy for relocation assistance. Do we need to have a policy? What is the best way to handle relocation assistance? Should we give the new hire a one time relocation bonus and report as wages on W-2? Have the new hire submit receipts and reimburse based on the receipts, qualified expenses wouldnt be taxable, but they would be reported on the W-2, nonqualified expenses would then be taxable to the employee and report as wages.

8	Question for WMCAT: If we have W-2 employees that are full time for 10 months and get laid off for 2 months per year (per their contract) should we write a 10 month contract of employment for the employees or 12 month contract? They do stay covered on the insurance through all 12 months because our health insurance policy has a 90 day layoff provision, which states that they can stay on the insurance for up to 90 days once laid off. Not sure if one has anything to do with the other.	
7	I am HR for a printing company, they are short staffed and are bringing back an employee who worked for the company for 2 months in 2015. They originally classified him as 1099 and plan to do the same again. I personally feel he should be classified as an employee. He will be using our equipment, on standard hours, following our procedures. They believe that because he will only be needed for a two weeks to a month that it would be easier to 1099 him because then they wouldn't have to complete a background check or drug test and therefore can have him start sooner rather than waiting for those two tests to complete. I have done my research and can clearly see he is an employee not an independent contractor. Please let me know if I am missing something.

4	We have a volunteer program. It has become an issue where we will bring on a volunteer with special needs and it is later realized they are unable to perform the job. One of our managers is asking a list of questions to applicants who have special needs. Only those with special needs will be asked the questions. We determine when to ask the questions based on self-disclosure of being special needs or it appears they may be special needs. The questions ask what are the special needs, what are their limitations, can they work independently. I have some concerns about asking these questions.

7	As part of our hiring process, employees must successfully pass a medical screening after they accept an offer. We recently had an applicant who was mistakenly medically cleared by the doctor. In the meantime, we had allowed him to begin work and he has been working for a week. We discovered the error because we were checking another applicant's medical results and accidentally clicked on the results for this employee again. We noted that new information had been added and when we contacted the clinic they did admit they had mistakenly not included information about a previous injury and some permanent limitations. We've now asked the employee to produce the information by the end of the week. If the limitations state that he has permanent restrictions that prevent him from performing the essential functions of the job without accommodation and we determine that there is not a reasonable accommodation available, can we terminate him?

6	If someone discloses that they have a medical marijuana card and we do pre-employment drug testing, how would we handle a positive result? Can we randomly test this individual going forward?

8	We are doing a one month project and don't know how to classify employees. My former employer would use 1099 instead of W2 and I'm not sure these individuals would qualify. Is there a way to set the classification in the system for a temporary employee?	
6	Hello, we're considering hiring an employee for a three-month project as a temporary employee. We have been and will be looking for a long term hire for the role we will be hiring the employee in a temporary capacity for. If we define the anticipated length of the project while still clearly stating the at-will nature of our employment in an offer letter do you see this as a viable option?	
8	I'm wanting to find out - the clients we work for require the employees have to have a certain amount of operating qualifications and they have to pass a pre employee drug test. As of now when they come in and fill out application we start paying them. Then the take the operating classes and drug tests. Some fail the drug test or don't pass the classes they need. It is costing a lot for this process. Can we, in the state of TX, make them pass what we need them to go to work for our client before they start getting paid? Pass the operating test and drug tests.

6	Hello Beth, Thank you for your response. I would love to take some time to discuss over the phone to help clarify. Andrew DeVlieger has reached out to switch access from Caroline Cunningham to myself. Please let me know if you will have any time to discuss. I look forward to speaking. Thank you, Andrew Lawson, AIRS-PRC Corporate Recruiter 1600 Viceroy, Suite 100 | Dallas | TX | 75235 t 214.445.1436 | m 817.443.2068 | freeman.com The system we have, it has a feature where we can take a candidate over to a requisition and invite them to apply. If they dont apply theyll be stuck in that forwarded status. To invite them to apply, they have to already have a profile in our system, so they would have already applied to a different position. Sometimes we might have a cancelled requisition and later reopen it and would invite them to reapply. We want to move them from the forwarded status to get them out of that section. Could we apply it to the same code that we call Data Management Technique and then for those who dont choose to apply to the new position, recode them to something else so that group is identified? If they dont apply they would then be stuck in that holding spot and we dont want that. We want to find a way to move them out of the holding spot, and move them into the position and using a specific code.

5	Are unpaid employees required to complete a Form I-9? We have an intern, who is not being paid, but instead receiving academic credit for her internship. Is she required to complete a Form I-9?	
1	We have a new hire coming on board soon. She asked if she should bring in her DD214 with her. This is the first I have been asked this and the first I have heard of the form. It is a Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty. Is this something I should be viewing when new hires go through the onboarding process to verify they are a Veteran if they are claiming Veteran status? Can we see a scanned copy of the document or only the original? I just wanted to check since it has never been brought up before.

1	Think HR, We have a previous employee that we're considering hiring back at our organization. We would like to set expectations for her before she accepts the formal offer. In the past she's had a Performance Improvement Plan for attendance. Would we be best off stating these off in written form but informally? Or, is there some type of commitment/contract that we could have her sign stating that she'll give our company at least a one year contract? Thank you, Tiffany Zahrt Shoreline Vision

1	Our company policy is clear that we don't provide visa sponsorships. We also have this on our employment advertising and employment application. We currently have a candidate who has gotten through the interview process to the reference checks stage. She is now advising she has her social security card and forms that she can provide to us and mentioned her F-1 visa status. We went back to our application, and she marked that she would not need sponsorship and that she is authorized to work in the U.S. We sent her a notice restating that we do not sponsor visas, and to clarify if she will require a sponsorship. She responded that she was able to work for 1 year on her current visa, and provided the information for the sponsorship, stating she would pay for it. Can we decide not to hire her because of this?

6	I-9 questions: When we hire employees that are at remote locations, we are unable to visually inspect their I-9 documents. How should we manage? Through an internal audit that I am conducting, I realize that I-9 forms were not completed or have missing information for several current employees. How should we manage? We now use an online system for I-9 completion.	
7	When in the process of hiring we run DCFS and criminal background and we receive authorization prior do doing so. We have an employee that has been here 14 months and the executive director wants a current background check. Are we required to obtain their authorization? This employee is currently on active duty in Afghanistan. There was a Department of Family Children Services hit on his background when he was hired. He is wondering if there has been anything pursued upon this. This came about because there was a picture of this gentleman with one of our managers on our Facebook page and someone made a comment that we had a child molester working for us.

6	Are we mandated to post a position? To date we have posted all positions publically before hiring. We now have a position open and we have a candidate for the position. This is not an internal candidate. We have a nondiscriminatory hiring process and we have nothing formally written that all position have to be posted. But this would be the first time we did not post the position.	
8	I would like to ask you a few questions in regards to the new hire packet and the availability we will be having to upload new hire packets from out in the field. Please kindly share your feedback on the following: If we create a page with a listing of all the documents reviewed/handed to the employee and the employee initials/signs is it okay for the employees to sign and acknowledge versus having to sign all the other pages? OR Would we be able to obtain with permission/disclosure from the employees a master electronic signature that will be placed in all the documents so that they do not have to sign each individually? The reason for the questions above is because we are trying to streamline how new hire packets are completed out in the field. Please share any ideas you may have.	
8	When we conduct interviews, is it okay to do evaluations / tests on candidates? For instance, we have candidates coming in today for finance, theyre trying to evaluate their skillset. After the formal interview, have the person work on an excel worksheet. Is this okay?

Is an employer supposed to try and seek the Soc Sec Number or what do they do in this case?	
1	Good morning; I have a question about the employees interview. If the employee needs the dog due to a disability, why didnt she bring the dog to the interview?

8	Good Morning! I have a quick question regarding start dates, we have unionized employees in which their contracted dates of employment start Sept. 5 of each calendar year. However, we often train these folks and pay them before that date. Am I safe in saying that an effective date of hire should be reflective of their first date of reimbursable work with the employer? Thanks! Meredith

1	I-9 -Interested to know how you handle this. A new hire showed a US passport as her documentation and right to work. in teh US. Only the birth date on the passport 1968 and the birth date she wrote 1988 do not match. And, she did not complete the section that requires the attestation. When we called her, she stated that there was mistake on her passport and that she has other documents to prove she is a citizen (SS card and valid AZ driver's license). Seems fishy, but if she can provide these documents, can we accept them or are we to police the documents- we use E-verify so I imagine that would pick up any thing fraudulent. By the way, her birth place is listed as Mexico on the passport, which looked valid.	
4	Is it legal in Oregon to ask salary/wage for Previous Work History?	
8	We are a multi-state construction company. Employees are hired on a project basis. Projects can be short term, a few days or a week to long term, many months or a year. We have frequent lay-offs. The employees in our industry are union and are used to working for multiple employers throughout, whoever has work available. We often call back the same individuals after a lay-off. The length of the time laidoff can vary greatly, as some work at other businesses in-between and arent available for our next project or sometimes it is just a number of months before we need more ee's for that particular position/trade. Is there any recommendations on when we need have rehires complete new hire in paperwork , such as new W4, new I9s etc. It gets to be a lot of paperwork and with the back and forth individuals can potentially end up filling the same docs out multiple times a yr. Are there any regulations around this? After 30 days of not working, after 90 days??	
8	I remember hearing there was a new CA law around not hiring people who have a felony of some kind. I have somebody that applied for this position and they were convicted of a felony. My policy says I can't hire them, but I would like to hire them. What is the law in CA about this? Do I need to change my policy?	
5	We have applied for an H1-B visa on behalf of an employee, but as of yet we have made no formal job offer to that employee. If at some point during the visa application process we decide to rescind the job offer what would be ramifications to the employer?	
2	I work in the New York office of our company and I went to our Providence office and we did the I-9s for new hires. Two of them had replied for replacements SSNs and Driver's Licenses. What do we do because I am not there? Do we complete a new page 2? Who completes Section 3?	
2	We will be re-hiring a former employee. Resigned 6/6/17 and will re-hire 9/15/17. What new hire paperwork does employee need to complete again? Do we also have to do a drug screening again? Thank you.

7	Hello, this is for my client Kurtz Fargo. Can you please help in answering how they should go about doing this? I have a quick HR question related to an employee who is going to be working for us off & on while he is still in college. Each time he comes back to work for a brief period (currently he is going to work for about a month), am I required to submit info to the CO Secretary of State new hires, obtain a new W-4, obtain a new I-9, get a health waiver (he is not eligible for benefits), etc?	
8	We have a division in Georgia. We have a new hire completing the the Form I-9. They have presented a foreign birth certificate, along with a certificate of naturalization, driver's license and military ID. Would this be sufficient for the I-9 verification?	
0	Do you know if there is a tax benefit for a company that hires a veteran?	
1	An new employee is insisting that she can use her Medicaid card (which doesn't have a photo but does list her name and social security number) for List C for I-9 purposes. I don't think that is correct; can you confirm?	
4	Just received notice from our background company that they will temporarily stop requesting/verifying salary information as part of our employment verifications beginning on October 1, 2017. Our company is located in 6 states (CA, CO, TX, OH, NY, FL) - if we decide to follow our background companies process, does this mean we can ask an applicant's current salary at their current employer? Can we ask what their desired salary is? or should all of this be removed from our applications and we should notify all hiring managers to not request this info?	
6	Hi, We have hired a driver in August 2017, on his background test we found the charge of Felony & Misdemeanor - PC petty theft. How do we handle such situation? Thanks	
6	We are in Anaheim, CA and our applications still have the box asking if employees have been convicted of a crime?	
3	We do not currently do background checks. An employment law seminar that I attended stressed that there could be liability for discrimination claims when doing background checks, so it isn't something that I have pushed for. We just had an incident where an employee was accused of breaking into a vehicle and stabbing someone and found out that he has been arrested twice previously for robbery. We are a manufacturing facility and do not typically have customers on site. I feel like we need to do something more to provide a safe working environment for our employees. Do you recommend pre-employment background screening? If so, would we just implement it going forward with new employees? How do we determine what is acceptable on a background check and what is not?	
4	Good Morning, I am revising our employment application and would like to know if I can ask the following question. Can we ask if they have any physical hindrance which does not allow them to lift 50 pounds repetitively or operate a piece of equipment over rough terrain?	
6	We are hearing that employers cannot run credit checks even for those employees who handle cash. HB 105. We are in MO.	
5	Asked on behalf of client: We need to write an employment offer letter for CA employees. We have a basic GA offer letter template but we need to revise this for CA employees.	
5	I had a few questions regarding pre-adverse and adverse action letters for the state of KS and MO. Should all potential employees receive a pre-adverse letter? Is there a date sensitive time from the verbal to the pre-adverse letter to be sent and then the pre-adverse to the adverse letter to be sent? Also, can these letters be sent electronically or is best to send via certified mail?	
4	On an employment application, can we ask for compensation history?	
7	Intern has worked out great and is going back to school. He proposed continuing his internship while he is in school. Is there any problem with us having him work remotely and keeping him active?	
8	Looking for guidance regarding the orientation and onboarding process. We require online orientation prior to the hire date. We pay the employees for the time to complete the online orientation, which may occur 1 to 2 weeks before the employee's start date. If we have to pay them for that time, would we still be in compliance with the Form I-9 completion on the day they actually begin working?	
7	We have an applicant who applied for a job. In the interview he mentioned that he did not have a ssn because he was on an OPT 1 . He also noted that he had a sponsor. As a potential employer as far as the I-9 verification what documents should he have that would show he was legally allowed to work in the US? As far as federal taxes are they withheld? Thanks.	
2	New Hire Checklist that includes more than benefits specifics.	
6	If we have an out of state employee, how do we verify their IDs in regards to the I-9 form?	
8	I have a temporary employee who is working with us part time through an agency. We want to hire this employee on as a full time employee of the company, however, there is a conversion fee owed to the agency if we do this within a certain time frame. Would we be able to keep her working part time through the agency, and then part time as a direct employee of the company until the end of the year?

7	We have an applicant who let us know that he can't drive. I asked if this was a temporary thing or an all the time thing. He said it was because he has seizures. He had a seizures a month and a half ago. What would be our liability in hiring someone who might hurt a client if he had a seizure while cutting their hair? What would be our liability if we did not hire him? Can we just offer him a part-time shift?	
7	Hi. Can you advise on rejecting a candidate you interviewed 3 times (or even one time) due to their commute? It is the managers concern and would like to reject, reason is commute. This would be discrimination, as it is up to the candidate as to the commute, as he did come in for the interview. Manager feels he is interviewing other places and taking the first thing he can get since he hasn't been working since May and trying to find work. Management has had issues with those distance between work and home is far. I don't feel this is a reason, especially to document, as if the candidate found out, just like race or child care, that we would be discriminating against the candidate based on where he lives even though he applied and interviewed and knows the commute if selected.	
3	We do not currently do background checks. An employment law seminar that I attended stressed that there could be liability for discrimination claims when doing background checks, so it isn't something that I have pushed for.

8	I have a candidate that I just interviewed this morning for an apprentice position that we have available (entry level position). They openly disclosed without any prompting that they are Transgender and that they are 18 years old. I told her that we do not discriminate based on either of those, just solely on how one performs the job or how qualified they are. I am still in the process of holding interviews and am looking at other candidates as well. Do I need to be concerned if we do not choose this candidate (as others may be more qualified)? If not, how do I tell them they were not chosen in a way that would not hold us liable for discrimination?

Questions: 1. Do they need to notify employees that they are doing a DMV check, or does it cover it to say that a background check is being conducted? 2.

Fridays would be a hardship to us as that is when projects close and we wouldn't have a lead role to manage the flow. It could be unreasonable for us to approve. Could we ask that he locate another doctor that is local so this wouldn't place a burden on us? If we determine this would be a hardship at this point, could we choose not to move forward with the hiring process?

3	We would like to rescind a job offer based on information we discovered during the background check. I know the Fair Credit Reporting Act requires us to provide notice that we are thinking about taking action and a second notice saying that we are taking action. Do you have templates for these letters? Thank you	
6	I have a few questions regarding some stylists we're hiring following the purchase of a salon.	
6	We have someone whose I-797 notice of action filed.	
8	In the past, it was our understanding that we were allowed to run motor vehicle reports for our clients before they hired new employees. After speaking with a 3rd party vendor of MVR's they seem to think that there are compliance issues involved. Can you tell me if an insurance company is legally allowed to run motor vehicle reports on behalf of their clients?	
5	Which documents need to be presented by an individual who is hired with a J-1 visa?	
8	Is there anything that says we have to obtain references over the phone?	
8	Form W-4. Can we retain it electronically instead of maintaining the copy with a wet signature? The employee will complete the form on paper then scan and email it to us. Is this ok? Can we request certain documents for the Form I-9?	
0	Can you hire someone as an intern even if they are not attending college?	
1	We have an executive director who has left employment. We have hired a new one but she is going to assist for the next couple of months for what needs to be done. I'm making the recommendation that she stay on as an employee since she doesn't have any clients. She will be doing the same job and will be working with the new executive director.	
3	via Voicemail Background check policy. County with SS and DMV, and have added federal and nationwide and DOJ searches. Looking for support in creating a policy for background checks.	
3	I am working on a background screening policy. We currently do criminal background screens for the county that we are in and on the employee's driving record. We added federal criminal search, multistate search, and sex offender but have not begun to perform these. We would like a policy that stipulates which background screens will be performed based on the employee's specific job.	
4	Can we ask on the application if he has a crime record or if he has any felony. If not when can we ask him	
6	We are trying to hire a temp employee for 2 months. They wont' be in the US for most of the time? Is it okay if we check their I-9. How does that work if we hire a US employee but they will be working from another country for a few months?	
8	New Hire Packet Hello, A client of ours located in TN reached out to me looking for a checklist of the benefit documents like: CHIP, HIPAA, etc. that should be included a new hire packet. Can you advise on these documents? Thanks, Lauren Powers | Client Relationship Coordinator Strategic Financial Partners 830 Crescent Centre Drive, Suite 450 Franklin, TN 37067 O. (615) 786-9541 | F.

If you are not the intended recipient or their designee, please notify the sender immediately by return e-mail and delete all copies	
3	We usually do a background check post offer. In California, can you do a background check pre-offer?	
8	This is around recruitment. Our job boards are recently constantly asking us to post the salary or hourly rate for our open positions on the online job postings and SHRM even had an article saying that Google Jobs will have those with pay in their postings at the top of the list when searching for roles and those with repetitive words will be at the bottom. Thoughts? Any advise on adding the pay rate/salary in the job postings and recommendations? You would think that employers would constantly be looking at competitors job postings and trying to get the one up, and end up paying more for roles that are not worth the amount they are forced to have due to being able to attract candidates, over their competitors.	
8	We have an applicant who had with her during a phone interview a job coach. The applicant did tell the hiring manager in advance that she would have a job coach present on the phone; however the job coach ended up answer some of the questions. It was also noted that the applicant often needs to repeated wash her hands, and turn around in circles. When the job coach/applicant asked about the next steps of the hiring process they were told this was to be an assessment test. The job coach became very upset and stated the applicant has had issue with tests of this nature before and would need the coach present. Can we say the coach can't be there during the test? Can we ask that the coach not be able to help her answer question? Can we have the coach not answering questions at future interviews?	
8	An employee has given us a verbal acceptance for a job offer. One of our executives has made the announcement to the team that the employee will be starting and has also disclosed the candidates information about where he currently works. Are there any laws	
6	Pre-employment screening process We are considering hiring employees whose background has not yet been completed. Criminal searches for counties take a long time since the court records are not on computerized system. We have lost out on good candidates because while waiting for the results (upwards of 20 days), they found other employment.	
8	My employee did not provide a bad social. The payroll system gave us an error code. It could be missing, invalid or restricted. The employee was hired three weeks ago. After receiving this notice, my counterpart asked the employee to bring in all their documents again. We believe the permanent resident card is fake and the social is fake. The drivers license looks ok. Do we terminate her now?	
7	We have a few companies and one of our locations in Nevada recently rehired someone that we had terminated for stealing from the kitchen. This individual was rehired as a cashier at one of our casinos. I have great concern about this since his background check results came back with additional charges and there's currently a warrant out for his arrest. I don't want him as a cashier. Can I discuss this with him? '	
4	With a few states considering passing laws on prohibiting employers from asking candidates about past salary history, are there exceptions for recruiters? If not, how can we get around this topic?	
7	We are having a previous employee come back and work for us for a couple of months (probably 3 months). He is going to take on an Executive Chef role. I wanted to find out if that could be as a contract person or if it has to be as a temporary employee. Please advise.	
6	We are recruiting to hire a new HR Manager. The staffing agency that we are using has informed me that they are no longer able to run background checks on candidates who will be hired by our organization. Is that true? How can we work around this?	
5	Hello, our company is currently interviewing for a warehouse driver. I was wondering, legally, how can I obtain a driving record for the potential employee?	
5	I have been looking at your employment applications. Can we include social security number and birthdate on that form to run a credit report? Thanks, Martha	
2	New Hire paperwork Hello, We are a 9 employee, non-profit in Philadelphia. May you please send us templates for new hire paperwork? Are applications mandatory? Thank you!

3	Do you have a form for background check?	
5	Currently I have an independent contractor working for me who creates educational lesson plans. I would like to add administrative responsibilities to their responsibilities. Can I continue employing as a 1099 or would this make them an employee? Isn't it risky to issue a 1099 and W-2 for same tax year?	
4	During an interview, can you ask about commute time and distance? Can we deny employment based on these factors?	
3	We are interested in a candidate to work in our intake division that handles patient credit card payments. An offer was made contingent on an acceptable background check result. I have just received notice that this person filed bankruptcy 4 yrs ago, has been turned to collection by three different creditors in the past 6 months and is 4 months behind in mortgage payments. Please advise.	
8	I understand that if an employer has a new job opening up, that an official job posting on the position or need should be "posted" so that all employees are given the same opportunity and the position is-in-fact "flown".... But, is this a mandatory requirement? Or is this a more of a morale policy? Or ... am I incorrect? T	
8	Aargus Plastics Mike Ferraro I spoke with a representative there over a week ago about an HR issue, they said they would get back to me in writing and that hasn't happened unless I missed an email I tried to call it said your office is closed, although it's 3pm CST on Friday. If there's someone there that can look up my account and the question and get back to me at Mike@aargusplastics.com I appreciate it thank you	
8	If a manager used to work at the same location as an applicant, can the manager reach out to ask about the applicant? Should that be done by HR? Is it okay to do?	
6	We did something with e-verify a few years ago through a different payroll provider. We do not use this now with Just Works. Do we need to continue to use e-verify?	
1	An employee has presented her ID for List A of her Form I-9, but she does not yet have a SSN. How do we enroll her in benefits?	
8	I'm updating a job description. I need help on "Heavy Lifting". At this time we have "Move and handle boxes of merchandise and fixtures throughout the store, which entails heavy lifting and perform all functions as set forth." Can make this more specific, like able to lift up to 50 lbs? I think heavy lifting can be interpreted in many ways.	
5	tips for managers when interviewing	
8	We have an employee with an F1 immigration status working toward an H-1b application status. My understanding that as her 'Sponsoring' employer, we have to meet certain requirements or standards relative to pay scale and non-discrimination relative to taking jobs away from valid US citizens etc. It is my understanding that the EE is however, responsible for the actual H-1b application, not the employer and that approval is not guaranteed.	
8	I am looking for the law and/or agency that provides us with determining when an applicant meets the minimum requirements as stated in the job description and not to pass along a resume to the hiring managers due to not meeting the min. requirements.	
5	Can you tell me if an employer is required to re-verify an employee on their I-9 if they left and were re-hired with company within 30 days?	
0	Can you please send a summary of what should be in a new employee intake package and also a schedule for onboarding? Bullet points are fine.	
2	When rehiring a new employee, what paperwork do we have to redo and what paperwork can we reuse from previous hiring? Id there a timeline for different documents, if so what is it? At what point/time length is a person treated as a "rehire" vs. a new employee?	
6	We are in the process of hiring somebody. They were going to have someone come out to shadow for a few hours. Do I have to pay them? They were thinking about hiring an intern over the summer. Can they be unpaid? What are the criteria for unpaid interns?	
3	We had a candidate apply for a technician position and we made a conditional job offer. We require a background check along with an in depth physical exam. The background results came back with a few felony offenses. These offenses took place on 9/14/15 which include conspire break/enter building with intention to commit felony, breaking and or entering, larceny after break/enter, obtain property false pretense and felony possession of stolen goods. However, the disposition for all of these offenses are still PENDING. Can we proceed to deny employment even though the disposition is still pending? Our tech are sometimes sent to job sites that have high security and require our tech to have a clean background.

5	Is there a way to hire a full time "contract" worker without offering benefits for an applicable large employer?	
8	notary public - I9 Washington State Good morning! We have a remote new hire starting next week, and will work in WA state. We are located in NYS. We have an online onboarding process which includes I9. However, we do need someone to view the documents that he copied for the completion of the I9 document. Typically I have another company employee view the document, take a picture of it and send it to me for our files. In this case, we do not have another employee working in this state. Can he show this to a notary public who can attest that s/he viewed the original document? Typically, they witness a signature but that is not the case here. If he shows the original document to the NP, brings a copy of the same document and states, "This is a copy of what I presented for my I-9 verification" and signs it - could the NP then sign that document? Any suggestions you may provide are greatly appreciated. Thank you!

1	We started a spin off company in Nepal but 2 employees work in the U.S. They work closely with us. One individual was hired as a 1099 then we transitioned her to a W-2 employee. She's being hired under this other company and I"m not sure if she should rehired as a 1099.	
5	non paid internships	
1	We hired a temporary, part-time intern. She is an international student with CPT authorization. She was given approval for a social security number but wont have it for a couple weeks. Does she fill out paperwork as normal?	
0	I think you misunderstood my question. Can a manager do reference checks when you're considering hiring someone or should only HR do reference checks?	
3	Corp office is in Minnesota and we have employees in every state. We have a question about background checks and what the adverse action laws are by state. Is there a state that takes more strict rules on whether you can take adverse action on background checks, as well as what is the process for candidate notification and steps to follow.	
3	HI, we are going to start doing background checks on our employees and potential employees. Do you have a recommended company to use? It will be just Criminal Background checks no credit checks. Since we have employees in other states we would need it to be avail for all states. Thank you.	
6	We have a temporary staff who is working for us 3 days a week for 6 hours a day. We supervise their work and have them come in at set times that we have scheduled them for. Can we still pay them as a contractor or do we need to put them on our payroll?	
8	North Carolina In the state of North Carolina we have a customer that we put employees through a 90 minute orientation and then a practice tour of the facility. The tour they can see what the job entails as it is a produce warehouse and the facility is cold and they are in water with their hands for the job. If we have people that go through the orientation and tour and choose not to take the job are we required to pay them for their time?

5	New RE is looking for an Office Manager Job .	
6	Hello, Sometimes other organizations send us their employees for us to fill out I-9s (they are out of state, etc). When we are completing I-9s for these other employers, should we put our own address and information in Section 2: Certification Section or should we put the employers address? Thank you!

6	We have two different franchises wanting to share a single employee. Can we share I-9 documents and other paperwork so the person doesn't have to fill it out twice?	
0	Question 1 of 2: Is an employee with a DACA permit eligible to work for our company? Please let me know Thank you Chris Koo (213) 225-1012	
3	We recently had an independent party audit our department. One of the recommendations was regarding post-offer background checks. Is it fairly standard to check references post-offer? If we choose not to move forward due to a reference check (not the background) do we need to issue an adverse action? How do we carefully communicate that to the candidate. We just due criminal background check through the vendor. Internally we do the reference calls to prior employers. How do we communicate that? Is it still standard to do reference checks pre-or post-offer? When it is post-offer, is it post-accepted or is it we sent the offer. Is it when we send it or once its accepted?	
6	We are having major difficulty hiring and retaining our drivers. We just recently had a big turnover as our drivers don't stay too long especially the new hires. What can we do?	
1	I had an employee who during an interview mentioned the pregnant candidate she was concerned about the amount of time off she might need due to her pregnancy. What are my risks?	
1	We did a background check on a potential new hire. The check came back with information that she plead no-contest to a charge of theft seven years ago. She did not indicate this on the application. When we stated there was something found, she initially responded that this was no big deal. What can we legally ask her about regarding this?	
6	Hello. In our onboarding note to our new hire, we list out things that they will be doing on their first day, including anything they should bring with them. To complete the I-9, we ask that they bring their passport OR a SS card and drivers license. Is there an issue with us making a recommendation on what forms of ID to bring? Or do we need to send them the list of acceptable documents and not tell them what to bring with them? Thanks.	
0	Do you have information that would be helpful in training hiring managers on what not to ask in interviews.	
8	We Texas senate bill #9 requires a background check for school and contractors. One of the working in the bill is that 'the employee has direct contact with students'. What is defined as direct contact? Our workers will be on the school property, but they don't necessarily have to engage the employees.

7	One of my clients will have a contract employee coming onsite who has a medicinal marijuana card. They are a rehabilitation facility and they would like to have added to his contract language which states that he cannot come to work having utilized THC. Can we do that?	
8	During a phone screen a candidate asked about the office demographic and how a transgender person would be treated/accepted in our company. Are there any things we should consider in our response or is it ok to be factual about the general demographic and company culture?	
6	We currently do not perform background checks. We would like to start the process, if we decide to move forward with this, will we be required to do it for all current employee's too?	
6	Someone mentioned that I was not to ask potential candidates for their ssn and dob to verify their security clearance in JPAS. The positions we have require a certain security clearance and before we can interview them we need to know their clearance level and if it is active etc. Is there a certain language Im supposed to use to do so?	
7	I have a student who is in a masters program for science. He is still in school he is finalizing that soon. He can go straight into OPT, normally it is 12 months, but since it is science he gets another 24 months. What is the employer obligated to do? Do they have to verify the school?	
0	Do you have interview questions to avoid?	
0	Hello, Can you send me some documentation on what a proper job description should include? I am looking at getting more details JDs on file for our employees and am wondering what they should include from a compliance perspective. Thanks!	
0	Do you have information on what Hawaii's job board would be? We are a federal contractor and I need to post a new position there (this is our first hire in Hawaii). I found one called Hawaii Job Bank but you have to pay for postings so I don't think that is it.	
8	I am asking this question on behalf of our client, Apple Fund Management. They are interested in best practices for an employment application. Do companies still request they be completed in this age of technology or have they gone by the way side as employees enter most of this information on-line through an onboarding process at time of hire.	
3	Do you still have my Workplace? I went to Myworkplace.com and it didn't come up. I'm looking for referrals for background check vendors.	
7	We use Indeed for recruiting candidates. We hired someone and had to terminate him due to tardiness and failure to show up. He continues to send messages and apply through Indeed. I sent him a rejection notice through Indeed which he responded to by saying "cut the BS and just rehire me". Should I send him a message outside of Indeed? Are we required to rehire him?	
6	We have a project coming up that will require us to hire 20 additional 40 hour per week employees for a 6-9 month project. Can we hire them as temporary employees and not offer them health benefits?	
2	How may an employer complete Section 2 of the Form I-9 when the new hires are located out of state?	
6	We will be placing an ad for a warehouse employee. We want to reference the ability to speak Spanish and want to know the best way to put that in the ad so we don't risk discrimination.	
5	I've never rescinded an offer before. What are the things I need to be aware of?	
6	We had several candidates lined up for a position and moved forward with one candidate before interviewing all candidates, can we let the last candidate know via email that we will not be holding the interview.	
3	When is an employer obligated to begin the pre-adverse process when a background comes back as Not Passing? For example, if we're only in the interview stage and no offer has been made, do we need to begin that process or is it only after an offer has been made?	
7	We are making an offer to a potential hire. He currently has working authorization to work in the US for 2 years. After that time he will need a sponsor. Can we as an employee write in our offer letter that after a successful probation period of 3 months, we intend to sponsor him?	
3	How long does someone have to dispute a pre-adverse action letter? Also, if we have made an offer contingent on the background check and we find out that the background check does not match up with the information listed on the application do we still need to send a pre-adverse action letter? Thanks in advance for you help!	
8	Hi There, Thank so much for your response! I received a follow up question from the client: I may have not been clear with my question. We do not ask for the social or DOB on the application. Our job requisition does list what the minimum clearance level that is required and when I do a pre-screening interview its after Ive received the application or resume. At this point before I can submit them to Meredith for the actual interview where she would go into the details of the job I have to get them to sign an NDA and have them run through JPAS to verify that their clearance is what they say it is and that is active. So with all of that being said is ok during my pre-screening interview to gather their social, DOB, and city of birth to run them through JPAS? Thank you.	
7	I have a new hire who came in yesterday with just his driver license and today he had a receipt for his social security card. It was dated today. He had lost his wallet.	
8	Since the legalization of marijuana in Nevada I have some questions about hiring processes. Can I follow the federal statute and forbid marijuana usage in the workplace? Can I require new hires to submit to a drug test including marijuana? Can I conduct random tests in Nevada? Please let me know, Joe Tate	
5	Can a California non-profit organization use an unpaid intern?	
3	We're a temp agency. A manager is requesting that I include a background check authorization form in all new hire packages. What are your thoughts on doing so?	
5	Requesting questions for checking references for a CFO position. Candidate has given me 9 possible references.	
5	I called in earlier and while I did receive a response it does not reflect what was discussed. If we were to hire someone who failed a drug test for marijuana in California would that precedent setting.	
6	Hiring and job posting, applications. We posted a position for our non-profit institution. One of our hiring practice is to request a complete application with 3 letters of recommendation/references that are dated within 2 years. I got a response by a candidate who commented that they were injured for the last two years, so I'm being discriminated against because I dont have recent references and isn't that illegal? Are we required to change our practice? How should I respond to this candidate?	
1	We have a person that has applied for a job that is a former employee at one of our facilities. She was with us for several years before sustaining a work injury where she could no longer perform her job duties. That was approximately 6 years ago. Her work performance was sub par and we have no interest in rehiring her. She's applying for the same position she was in before. To add to that her job application that she filled out was in complete and the questions were not answered properly. She has called asking if we have reviewed her application. I'd like to send her a letter but I'm unsure how much information to include. We have a standard letter that we send out to applicants that thanks them for applying, we'll review their information and call if interested. OR should I be more direct and thank her but tell her there will be no interview.	
5	We hired an intern. This will be a paid internship. Is there anything I need to be aware of in terms of employing an intern? Is there specific language I need to include in the offer letter?	
3	I sent an email last week and did not get a response. Concerning background checks in Illinois: If we do a background check, do we have to do it on everybody we hire, or can we be selective. We have full-time, part-time, and seasonal. If we do it on one, do we have to do it on all. If we go through a service do we do a complete check if they are not handling money? Most employees would be handling money. Do we have to do a criminal background check for maintenance? Do I have to be selective in who run checks on? Can I just go into county records and then decide who to do a background check? Send overviews of state and federal and sample policy.	
5	When job applications/resumes are received should all employees have access to this information?	
7	We have an employee who is just going to be a contractor. Would he be able to stay on our insurance for three months and then put him on COBRA? I'm not sure if he is an employee or independent contractor.	
3	We hired someone who worked for us as a temp. Our process is that we run a background check and drug screening prior to hiring even if the individual had these run through an agency. I came across one employee who was through a temp agency that for some reason our HR manager at the time did not run them even though he had submitted the forms authoring it. Can I go back and run them now?	
8	Our staffing agency has temps working in the field that may be considered for conversions to the client's payroll. The client first wants to know if the employees are citizens or aliens authorized to work. Are we allowed to disclose this information?	
1	I am considering extending an offer to a candidate. She disclosed during the interview process that she has arthritis. I think we can accommodate with a stool she can use. As part of the hiring process we have candidates sign the job description confirming that they can perform the duties of the job including all the physical requirements. Can I have her sign this?	
3	Q1-About legality about require a motor vehicle report in post offer or pre-offer and who would pay the fee. If we can use what is in the report to rescind an offer or terminate. Our insurance broker is saying it might be a good idea to get reports. 99% of our staff work in the field and reliable transportation is required. Not everyone has multiple assignments. Because our employees are working with children, a criminal background check is requirement. Do employers have to pay for background checks that are required by law?	
1	Contractors we are hiring one to do recruiting coordination. Do we put her on a 1099? She will working from her home in LA and will also be assisting with writing policies.	
6	Do we have to include benefits, such as short term disability, health etc to a contracted employee? We are thinking of hiring a person for approximately one year to do specific jobs.	
3	Can you suggest a company for background checks?	
8	Is it allowed to contract inside sales agents who work outside of state. Some duties would be to be responsible for making outbound calls, they will be assigned a work schedule, sales training, they have access to the CRM system, they will use the company's call center software to make calls.	
6	Is there anything different we need to do when hiring a non U.S. citizen? Should our process be modified?	
4	We are looking at including the sponsorship question on our application. I know there are about 2-3 of them. Also the eligibility question.	
0	We are a consulting company and a potential client vendor has inquired on our process for recruiting (policies and procedures). Do you have a guide on a process?	
0	I attended a seminar recently that discussed the importance of including the "essential job functions" and physical requirements for various positions. Do you have a sample Job Description form that we can use, and can you provide further guidance on the ADA rules surrounding essential job functions and reasonable accommodations?	
3	Are you discriminating by only running background checks on applicants who mark yes, that they have a previous felony conviction?	
6	We had posted a lower restaurant position online and we had someone from a placement service with disabled candidates. Do we need to do anything with the information they dropped?	
7	We have a candidate for a position that currently works for another company, the Home Depot, as an hourly associate. They were very forthright about his history and shared that 6 years ago he committed a robbery (not an armed robbery) which was a home burglary. He shared he was an addict at the time but said he went through rehab and turned his life around. We didn't ask for the information, he just volunteered the information.

7	We have a new employee who suffered a severe head injury while working for his former employer. He fell from a height of more than 10 feet and fractured his skull. He is currently in litigation with his former employer. Is it appropriate for us to ask the employee to provide a release statement from his doctor indicating he is cleared to work?	
4	This Halloween, an NYC law goes into effect banning employers from inquiring about an applicant's salary history. I'm wondering how this affects my response when called by an employment verification service and asked about salary history. Should I ask if the service is being used by an NYC company and refuse if yes? Should I refuse to answer that question regardless, since we are an NYC-based company? Or is it fine to disclose the information? Thank you for your help!	
1	A new hire is completing her Form I-9 at our remote office. She does not know which box to check in Section 1. She has a SS card, but I do not know what other documents she presented.	
3	Good Afternoon, I know best practice is to run background checks after a conditional offer is made, however, can references be checked prior to making an offer? or do references fall under the scope of a background check?	
5	We have an employee who provided an EAD for her I-9, is this the type of visa that requires sponsorship?	
5	Is there an equivalent form of Labor Code 2810.50 for Arizona?	
0	As part of a relocation package offer for a new employee, we are offering to purchase her house. Do you have any example language I could include in the offer letter?	
5	I need the guidelines for having a contract employee. and the guidelines for a temporary employee. Any specifics to employee under either two conditions We have have a client that is looking to hire for about a year and four months worth of work to work on 1 project.	
6	We do post job offer drug screening for all employees. We are now looking to outsource salon services (between 3-5 employees) and the company we are considering does not drug test their employees. Can we legally test direct hires, but not test indirect hires (like through this contract). Even it it's not illegal, is it not a good practice?	
6	Client has an F-1 employee with EAD that they are trying to figure out how they should be paying them They are trying to see if they need to pick up the sponsorship because they are not students anymore and what taxes they should be withholding.	
7	We had a temp who we were considering hiring and the agency had already drug tested him, he had tested positive for marijuana and another drug. We do not eliminate marijuana users but the other drug should have eliminated him from consideration. We sent him for a screening with us because the temp agency did not provide us with accurate results. His test with us came back showing just marijuana, and they then shared their full results. This does per our stander policy eliminate him as a candidate. I would prefer not to deviate from policy, but we already have by testing him unnecessarily the second time.	
6	We have positions that are open. Candidates that are coming from different countries - how do we ask about ability to work in the US?	
6	Recruiting tools for our management team as we move towards a more formal process.	
6	We are looking for an employee hiring form like what we use for our regular employees, but that says it's for an intern. They will be hired on as paid employee/interns.	
0	We want to contract work for a special project. Do you have any contractor template agreements?	
2	Follow up to yesterday's issue. The new company who is acquiring us is asking that employees complete new W-4s and I-9s. But ADP is able to transfer the employee historical data to the new FEIN with all YTD totals carrying over, and only 1 W-2 at year end. This seems in conflict. What is correct?	
5	An employee I hired in 2015 and ran him through Everify and gave us an authorized to work card.	
5	What information can be given for previous employee verification? what questions can be asked to confirm work history?	
5	What is the legal liability using personality tests as a candidate screening tool?	
7	We are in Michigan: candidate came back with a positive drug test for marijuana, but has a medical card. He would be in an office position. What guidelines should we follow? This has not been specificially addressed in our handbook or policy.	
1	We noticed that our top candidate has an interesting experience listed on her linked in page. She listed a surrogate on her resume. when the hiring manager looked at her profile, it shows current experience at another surrogacy agency. Are we allowed to ask her if she's planning to take any extended time off in the next year? I know we can't ask if she's pregnant and am hesitant to dig deeper We'd like to make an offer to this candidate today.	
7	We hired somebody last week. Came in filled out I-9. He was going to come in for training today. We found out some info on social media today that he was stealing from previous employers. (multiple employers) I called him this am and told him position was no longer available. I want to make sure that legally that's okay to do. We also found out he was a heroin addict. The stealing was on social media. We found this out after he came in to fill out the W-4 and all this stuff. Isn't that covered under the at-will? We told him the position was no longer available. We didn't give him any info. Should I have him start work next week then find a reason to terminate him? What should I have done? People that work here also say he has stolen. He was a really bad heroin addict.	
8	A colleague at another company provided one of our senior execs with a resume of an Admin Assistant stating that he understood we are hiring for a new admin and this person would be a great candidate. However, the resume is from a staffing firm. How should we handle this?	
6	We have made an offer for a position and I have decided not to hire this individual. The verbiage to use in the letter (we sent an offer letter and verbally accepted) we decided it is not going to be a good fit.	
6	We are thinking about bringing on volunteers for the summer and are wondering what are the compliance items around this. Insurance purposes, labor law, etc.	
1	We are hiring a full time paid summer intern for approx 2 or 3 months. Must we offer her health benefits? Paid sick leave? Other benefits? How should I mention this in her offer letter?	
7	We hire students to be resident employees. We have a candidate that has an F1 Visa, but did not apply for a Social Security Number. He knows he's suppose to get a number, what do we do in the mean time? Are we not able to hire him?	
4	If we notice a gap in employment history on a resume or application form, may we make inquiries?	
6	Unregistered User: Todd Bracher Tina Cheng 718-858-1415 Email: tina@toddbreacher.com We are planning on hiring interns for the summer. Justworks stated that the employee's would not be covered under the WC insurance because they would not be in the system. Do we have to cover them through WC through Justworks and can we have a separate program paid through our company?	
5	I'm trying to Reverify an I-9 for an employee whose document expired. He has provided a foreign passport and visa. I'm trying to process this through E-Verify but I can't find the number that is supposed to go into E-Verify.

1	We had a temporary employee 1099 who fell asleep at work today and we want to let her go.	
3	A background check was run after the employee was hired. Results indicated an on-going case surrounding 3rd degree theft charges. What am I allowed to do/ask to better understand the situation and how it may impact my business? What actions can be taken regarding their employment if I find that the employee's history is too high of a risk for my organization?	
8	Received from client: If a candidate marks the box to NOT contact a previous employer. Should we not contact them at all? Just seems a little odd that they wouldnt want us to contact the last two employers.	
6	We are a small business and have questions about remote working. We currently have no remote workers or policy in place. We are considering making an offer to someone who would take on a position that could be done remotely and we can allow her to work from home/remotely. She would hold a very unique role and would be the only one with that role. We want to talk about options and things to be aware of.	
3	Background check authorization?	
6	We are thinking about making part time employee's and interns independent contractors. What are the requirements?	
0	Hello, Thank you for the information regarding the summer interns- it really helps! When we spoke you offered to send me documents (hiring agreements) that we can have the intern sign so they understand their hours and absence of certain benefits.

4	In Missouri, can you 1. ask if an applicant has been convicted of a crime on the employment application 2. If so, can you ask an applicant during the interview process about their crime conviction if they mark yes We are a public educational institution with approximately 200 employees.	
0	Unable to access your site on PIHRA website. They told me to call you. New Hire - OPT visa in process. Can we have her start now? What is DOL 6 prong test for unpaid internships?	
4	Asking for a client - Wing Point Golf & CC They would like to include language on their employment application asking if they have been convicted of a crime in the last 10 years. What would you advise regarding this?	
1	We have a part time employee who is going to be joining us as a full-time employee in the middle of May. Our insurance begins the date of hire, her insurance ends with her prior company the day before so she would be without insurance for 1-2 days. Can we have her hire date be different than her start date?	
4	We want to do an income/employment verification on a potential new hire. No offer has been made yet. We have a question on our application which asks if the candidate gives permission to contact their former employers. The candidate in this case said yes. Are we okay to call their former employer and ask about the candidate's income?	
4	Is it legal for me to call/check references on an employment application before I ever interview the applicant?	
7	We are considering bringing on an financial anaylst on a part time basis. He has recently moved to the US and is here on Green Card. What do we need to do to ensure he is legally able to work from a new hire/on-boarding and documentation standpoint ?	
3	1) If I am hiring someone as a temporary for a regular employee for a leave of absence, do I need to do anything different? We don't want to do the drug test and background check. 2) Is it weird to keep trying to call someone's reference again if they don't call back after the first time?	
2	A new client is in New York - what documents are required to give a new hire in New York? Is the IT2104 optional like the DE-4? Where can I normally find this information on your website?	
7	I have been asked to hire an employee in a different state. The employee will be working remotely from home in Illinois. We do not have an office near him. What do we need to consider when hiring him? He will be inside sales making calls to other states.	
6	We do extensive pre-employment screening, medical and background testing. Can we have employees complete their I-9 when we begin the testing? How can we circumvent them not being eligible to work in the U.S. and doing all this pre-employment stuff? I'm located in Canada so I'm not that familiar with the I-9 purpose and process.	
2	I'm working with a new fitness franchise called F45. I will be meeting with their business partners tomorrow to discuss their first hires and other insurance issues. They have asked me to bring a checklist of all new hire related documents needed here in GA. They are a brand new company and anticipate having about 5-10 employees in the next 6 months. Can you send me a list of what is required for small employers in GA relative to employee forms?	
8	When we get a new hire, they fill out their paperwork and I attach photocopies of their forms of ID to the I-9. It is normally a SS and ID card. I attach them and then file them away in my I-9 binders. We recently had a vendor that said that we cannot keep the copies of the documents attached to the I-9 and that we should separate the documents and put those in the personnel file. Is it true that we are not permitted to keep the copies with the I-9? I know we can keep the copies, just not sure about whether there is guidance about whether we can attach them to and keep them with the I-9 form. Additionally, do you have any sense of how far back an I-9 audit by the USCIS would go? Is it a certain number of years?	
6	Question 1 of 2: Pre-Employment Screening We are located in Austin, TX. We would like to conduct social media screening of candidates and are thinking that best practice is not to do that until after an offer is made to minimize the risk of discrimination. Is that correct? We would be looking for things that indicate unlawful activity or activities that might not align with our values as an organization. For example, someone who has a lot of pornography on social media, someone who is clearly part of a hate group, etc. Are we specifically prohibited from doing this? If not, what should we keep in mind?	
6	We provide conditional offer letters of employment for safety sensitive job positions. Can those employees start working before the drug and alcohol test results come back? If they were to fail we would then terminate employment. Or do we need to wait? Also how does these effect how we communicate start date in the offer letter. Further as we are required to pay someone for their test time, how do we do this if they aren't employed (especially if they test positive). Thanks!	
0	Do you have salary bench-marking information? Also, when sending out an offer letter, we would like to include total compensation. Do you have a template for this?	
7	If our policy states that we will not hire anyone who has had a felony in the last 7 years, is it okay to go by the disposition date rather than the date a sentence was served. For this particular person the date he was charged was more than 7 years ago but the date he completed his sentencing was 6 years ago. Is it our choice?	
3	We have an applicant who was interviewed and was not selected and is very demanding about not being selected. How to decline candidates? ========= We have applicants go through MVR check, behind the wheel driving test, drug testing, background test and physical before an offer is made.	
8	I am in the State of NE and was wondering if you would have a template for an ER sponsored housing program that shows stipulations on it for an EE to sign if they do the program. It is a county sponsored program that the company is matching funds for EE that have been employed less than a year and are buying a new house in our county. Just needing a template to start the agreement. Thanks!	
8	We use the applicant reject letter that is on the Indeed website. However, we have been receiving several negative responses that perhaps warrant a rejection letter with different wording. Do you have samples of this?	
4	We have a clinet who has asked if they can inquire of candidates whether or not they have ever had a workers compensation claim before.	
7	We have a candidate that we would like to hire an an engineer. However, he has informed us that he will need an H1B sponsorship. Would we be able to hire him as an independent contractor? His resume says that he has done contract work before.	
2	Is it okay to bring in a potential employee (pending drug test results) with a conditional offer of employment to the office prior to recieving test results to : 1. complete new hire paperwork and orientation 2. to train and/or 3. begin working?	
8	Are there any special sponsorship or documentation requirements for individuals who are residents of Puerto Rico or Hawaii to legally work in the U.S.?	
4	interview questions	
4	I would like information about asking candidates if they are smokers or tobacco users? This in PA. 877-779-4747 x1020	
6	We have some sales reps that are 1099 contractors and complete a W-9. Do we have to collect I-9 documentation and go through everify for them? Or is that just for W-2 employees?	
3	I have a follow up question to something I submitted earlier. Puerto Rico is down and they cannot run criminal background checks for those people working with children. Can we ask if anyone has been to Puerto Rico part of the process?	
8	I have a few follow-up I-9 questions. When I have employees complete a new I-9 because either they never completed one or the original has been misplaced, which dates do we use? If an employee is completing their I-9 now, can the documents the provide be issued after the date of hire?	
2	Can you please send the required new hire forms for both CA and IN as well as Federal requirements?	
5	On the DE-4, do all sections 1, 2 and 3 need to be completed? This is an employee from Canada so should I be providing guidance on what to put on the form?	
8	Good morning/afternoon, What if someone was convicted or charged in 2004 or longer than 7 years, and they are a lifetime sex offender, will that show up in the background that we run? Also, question, what is the thought of NOT hiring them, based on them being a sex offender?	
6	I want to confirm around hiring and not hiring, we are across the US and we do not want to hire outside of the US. Can we do this? If somebody who applied and was going to be living in the US for a few months and then was going to move out of the US?	
7	I made an offer of employment last week to a candidate and the start date is Oct 2nd. He has given notice. We have a signed offer of employment. He and I had an exchange and I am now concerned about his communication and commitement. I am having second thoughts and either want to 1. Remove the offer or 2. make him an offer as a contractor so I can evaluate if he'd be a good employee. Any thoughts on if and how I can do this? I have a meeting with him at 10am tomorrow morning, so quick response is appreciated.	
3	I just called but I have a couple more questions: 1. If an employer conducts pre-employment background checks, must they do it for all positions or can they do it for only certain positions or departments? Should it be done post offer only or can they conduct criminal background checks before an employment offer is extended? 2. Same questions re: drug testing? Can we pre-employment drug test drivers only, and not others? Can we drug test prior to offer of employment extended?	
2	Hi, What are the required documents to provide to new hires in the state of California? Thanks, Zeina	
8	If a job applicant voluntarily discloses they are on medication for epileptic seizures during the interview process, and the position interviewing for would require them to operate a forklift or electric pallet jack, can we make a decision based on the interview due to this safety concern? There were no other red flags during the interview regarding qualifications, just the self disclosure of the medicine. Please let us know.	
5	Is it legal to require presentation of a Visa from foreign workers to establish tax status (explicitly not ID verification)?	
8	I just had a question about I-9 forms. We use Paylocity and they do our on-boarding and have the forms all done electronically through their system. We print out the I-9 forms once completed. Do we have to physically sign this, or is the electronic signature that they give us through the system okay? Does Paylocity count as an adequate electronic vendor for the I-9 forms?	
3	Hello, Does an employer have to have written consent/signature of an applicant in order to submit them to a criminal history background check? The employer is not checking credit history. Thank you

5	I am considering sponsoring a candidate for a project manager position. How would this process work?	
6	A couple of weeks ago we offered a job to a person, who was to start Monday (1/30). We had another employee come back (re-hire) in the interim and literally have no seats available. We are a tax advocate group. No offer letter was signed, this was a verbal offer. Can we rescind this offer?	
2	We get our applications for new hire either emailed to us or faxed. Do we need to have the original too?	
5	Hi, Does a temporary Driver's license in conjunction with an expired one and certified copy of a birth certificate count as acceptable documents under the I-9 requirement?	
5	We hired an employee on Monday he presented a SS card that says valid only with DHS authorization and an Employment Authorization card that expires in May 2017. Do I just need to stay on top of the EA card's expiration date?	
0	Do you have a resource that walks through the process/considerations/rules when bringing on an organization's first employee?	
7	We have a position we're hiring for and a good candidate came in and interviewed. Our physical requirements are on our job descriptions. He said he was in an accident and he cannot sit for prolonged periods of time. He said the injury shouldn't limit much of what he does. I don't want to have a worker's compensation injury. If he can't do the job, can we terminate him at some point? A physical is required for our drivers. If he passes the physical but needs accommodations, that can be part of it? But the physical cannot be the reason we rescind the offer?	
6	We are a business that is headquartered in Iowa. We are about to hire our first employee that lives in California. I know this is a broad question, but can you advise on things we may need to do differently or be aware of hiring an employee in California? One area I am specifically questioning is the State Disability Insurance that CA offers. What do we need to do as an employer here, if anything? Thank you!	
4	We are an AZ Company opening an office in Mass. Is it illegal to ask what the candidates current or previous salary is? If so, are there any questions we can ask to get an understanding of their salary expectations?

0	Caller Melody Poon. We currently have several international contractors. Do you have any suggestions in moving away from using contractors in these locations?	
3	We're in CA, 30 EEs. What are the steps to do background checks on new hires? Do I have to formally get written permission from them in order to proceed? Is the language about "offer contingent upon background checks" in offer letter enough to do the check? Should I do it upon offer or can I conduct it after they've started working at company? Thanks, Ann	
2	New Health Insurance Marketplace Coverage Notice What do I need to do with this notice?	
4	Our client is asking us to research and comment on the following as it relates to their employment application. Should we ask their Veteran status? EEOC also frowns upon the criminal conviction question. Wisconsin is not a Ban the Box state yet so legally we are able to ask this question, but the state could pass a law forbidding this question. I think you were also going to ask Cottingham (or I can also ask) about our website and ADA compliance. Should we be Adding captions to videos or adding a line on our hiring page to state if you need assistance completing the application please contact our office.	
2	We created a template for new hires with the business time frames, from M-F 8:30am- 5:30 pm. Is that required to be in there, is it a best practice?	
6	Applicant tracking system where we have a field to include a note as to why a candidate was not hired. We had 1 position with 30 candidates who applied. We hired 3 vets to comply with OFCCP because we're a federal contractor. We had other qualified candidates but we chose to go with the vets. What do you recommend we post in the notes section for each candidate?	
5	Is the state of NJ (private, non-profit school) required to use e-verify.	
7	A new company is coming on - he is wanting his employees to fill out a form for us to bring them on, such as routing and account form for direct deposit. The other is for collecting employee names, addresses, SSNs, etc. to set up payroll. For him as a new employer, he needs to collect W-4s, I-9s, etc. Do you have these forms? The employer is in Texas.	
3	Should I conduct the background investigation only after they have signed the offer letter or should I run the check as soon as we make the offer, assuming they have given us permission to do the check? Thanks, Ann	
4	Can employers ask veteran status on an employment application?	
5	There is an employee who marked Not A Citizen. They provided their drivers license and social security card. Is there anything additional I need to do in this case? Thank you, Demi	
8	When hiring an independent contractor who will work in another country, I am looking to confirm that we are obligated not only to abide by the US-based test of what a contractor is as well as that of the worker's home country. If we incorrectly classify the person as an independent contractor, we still assume the same risk that we would with someone misclassified in the US. Is this correct? Thank you.	
5	Can someone please advise on best practices in regards to hiring applicants with outstanding warrants?	
7	Can an employer rescind a job offer after it has been made? We are led to believe that a candidate has accepted a job based on the belief that he will be getting a different position in the future.	
6	HI, Is there a current form to use during the EE application process to serve as authorization to do background ck? We have one, but it asks for DOB, and SS number. I don't believe that's acceptable to request from applicants. We like to run their CDL through our insurance company as we need to know if they can be insured to drive our vehicles. We also like to have the option of requiring a drug test.

3	I work for an international company based in Asia and they want to start conducting background checks. There are too many options for the types of background checks. How do we determine the kinds we should run? Criminal, bankruptcy, civil? I need help in determining how to narrow down the list of options, and I don't want to rely on a vendor.	
6	We are doing interviews and one thing after we get the resume we call them to go over their skills to decide if we want to bring them in to the interview. I tell them we do a background check, drug test, and MVR.	
7	We have an unqualified candidate to whom I offered a job. At the time I offered him the job I did not realize he was unqualified and now in looking at his resume and application I'm seeing he does not have the necessary background. Can I withdraw the offer?

8	Hello, What would you recommend as best practices in this case: Employer wants to hire 1-2 new inside sales agents in El Paso. The issue with sales agents is the attrition is high due to performance issues. Employer like to give themselves some flexibility to terminate employment within the first 3 months if the employee does not meet expectations. What's the best way to structure this? Some ideas I have are: * onboard as a temp employee * employment agreement with a limited employment term (e.g. 1-3 months) and employer discretion to extend employment beyond the initial agreement	
0	Do you have a copy of the new 2017 employment application with ban the box? Can I get a copy?	
1	We have have an employee that has a legally different last name than the one she uses. All her paperwork was done under the name that he uses, but not her legal name. Is there a website we can use to verify employee's last names?	
6	We are going to start doing some HR metrics. We are trying to figure out the total cost per hire. I have some information on internal cost, external cost. For interview cost it gives you information to calculate based on salary and number of hours.	
7	I have a new hire who we are in the process of onboarding. He completed the Form I-9, and noted in Section 1 that he is a non-citizen national of the United States. What does the employer need to do about this? He provided a Driver's License and a Social Security Card. The employee also submitted a W-8 substitute withholding form. What is this form?

One of our principals knows one of the principals at a firm that is listed on the candidates resume. He wants to know if it is OK to call the principal at the other firm and ask about the candidate without going through their HR department or requesting references from the candidate. Any idea about this?

1	We interviewed a candidate who will need sponsorship and it is unclear what that entails. She graduated in 2016 and she needs sponsorship and her sponsorship and her visa is expiring in February, and is applying for a benefits analyst position, requiring risk management or finance. I am not sure what visa she is on. What should I ask her without crossing the line? She seems well versed in this area. She said the cost was $3500.	
6	(With colleague Barclay): We are in the process of hiring someone with a TN Visa. I was told to call this number for guidance to get guidance on what it entails. The person will be a designer from Canada. He's mentioned a letter. Would we have to pay any fees? If they work past 3 years does that affect us? Any hidden costs, fees, and sponsorship? Can we ask for proof of the TN visa? How will we know when renewal is required from an I-9 perspective? How do we know when to reverify? We have made a verbal offer.

I don't know answer to it, I would assume yes, but my department does not do that part, the credentialing department should, so should they be included in my policy then even though they are not employees? I am only in charge of policies for my employees. How are board members classified, employees or not? Thank you in advance! Marina

Yes or No - If yes, when. Our company likes to maintain a Felony free work atmosphere as there are many items in our shop that could be used to hurt other employees as well as our product that could potentially hurt a customer.

8	URGENT REQUEST I really need some clarification around the use of "Bona Fide Occupational Qualifications" for recruiting individuals with severe disabilities for the Ability One Program, which requires 75% of the individuals that work under this program to have a severe disability. To avoid running into a concern with discrimination, can I recruit for these positions with the verbiage that the individual must have a qualifying disability "and the job offer is contingent upon providing documentation of such? If not, do you have any recommendations of how I could recruit outside of being in the right place to receive applicants that may be a match. We do have an Ability One job description, which indicates that the individual must meet the criteria of the Ability One program. Please contact me so I can provide more information on Ability One qualifications. This is an urgent request. 540-684-6736

8	We ask all applicants if they are authorized to work in the US. Some of the candidates that are on a student visa will answer yes since they have a temporary visa. We do not wish to sponsor any new hires. Is this question ok to ask in addition to asking if they are authorized to work in the US- Will you now or in the future require [insert company name] to commence (sponsor) an immigration case in order to employ you (for example, H-1B or other employment-based immigration case)? This is sometimes called sponsorship for an employment-based visa status? FYI- we are headquartered in NJ, but have people working remotely all over the US. Thank you

8	Hi, We have a candidate that we are looking to place at one our clients in Jersey City. The client does fingerprinting on all potential hires and we are also required to do a full background check (includes 10 year criminal) on any potential hires at this client. The candidate has disclosed to our account manager that in 2005 he was convicted of child pornography/child abuse in California. Since the conviction is over 10 years ago, I don't think it will come up on our background check report but it might show up when he gets fingerprinted by the client. So the questions I have are: 1) Should we disclose this information to the client (usually we are required to 2) What liability do we have if the client declines to hire this candidate because of this conviction. The candidate would be a white collar worker in the IT field, so technically this conviction has no bearing on his ability to do the job.

8	Is it legal for me to call/check references on an employment application before I ever interview the applicant? _____ Our Response: While there is no law preventing the practice, it is risky.

1	We have a candidate who we have made an offer to, she passed her physical and drug screen. Her start date was the 20th of April. We got a call on the 19th that her daughter was in the hospital and could we move her start date to the 24th? She signed an updated offer letter with a 24th start date. Then she called back on the 24th that her daughter was still sick and could she start the next day. After discussing it, we agreed to push her start date to the 26th, today. Unbeknownst to HR, her Manager had also reached out to her and asked her if she wanted to push the start date out by a week. The candidate said no, Wednesday, the 26th is fine. She confirmed this at 3:30pm on the 25th. This morning, when we arrived, we had an email time stamped about 6:30am from her saying that she needs to take her child in to the doctor this morning to get some medicine and take the daughter to school. (It seems suspicious that she wouldnt have known about this yesterday late afternoon when we talked and she confirmed that she would start this morning.) We got another email from her 15 minutes before she was to arrive that stated that she was unable to reach us by phone and that she said she would be tardy today. (The candidate is still coming to HR as the recruiter/generalist, but not reaching out the Assistant Manager.) Her application said she was currently employed. The candidate during the interview that she was still employed. But then when we did our verification/background it said she wasn't working there anymore. When we asked her about it when we made the offer, she said she wasn't working there and she had already given her notice. We are no longer feeling very good about the hire. At this point, we would like to rescind the offer. We told her we would reach back out after we spoke with the hiring manager to talk about next steps.

8	I work at a science organization. We have advertised a 'tenure' eligible position. As it is a somewhat close knit community of scientists, the folks on the hiring committee are often colleagues, collaborators, and sometimes mentors to one or more of the applicants. There seems to be a conflict of interest. However, they think they can be fair and that their vote should still count. Any suggestions for how we can handle this to minimize the effects of the conflict?

6	We have an employer who is considering taking some employees who have been temporary independent contractors employees. They want to talk through what considerations and concerns they should be looking at? Unemployment, PTO, etc., I don't know if I am thinking about this the right way. My thoughts are that they would have UI rights they didn't have before. PTO rights? My other thoughts would be wage and hour and workers' comp, tax withholding would apply and it did not used to apply and making sure this was a bona fide class. I would love some HR guidance. I think they through an agency. They want to class them out as temporary full-timers and offer them other benefits. What do they have to do for holiday, PTO, sick leave, other leave laws? What CAN they carve out?	
8	My company is a medical staffing agency. There are a lot of positions that we offer, a lot of which demand a lot of physical movement. A manager asked me this question: "Franz and I were just talking it through and talking about "reasonable accommodation" and what the ADA says. In short, because toileting, transfers and supporting the weight of varied weight of patients is a daily (even hourly) duty of a CNA that it may be reasonable to ask them a qualifying question because without the ability to do that, they would not be able to perform the majority of job duties and provide safe patient care." I want to say that we can describe the various basic duties of the position and ask if they see anything preventing them from performing them without risk of discrimination. Am I correct?	
6	Hi, We are thinking of offering a $1,000 or $2,000 signing bonus for new hires. Is there anything we should be aware of legally? Is there a certain way we should word the ad? Is there anything we shouldn't be doing as far as offering a signing bonus? Thanks,	
7	We hired an individual to work in our fabrication plant. He started work this morning. We only learned this morning that he cannot read or write English. This is an essential function of the job because he is responsible for reading and interpreting blueprints. How should we manage without being disriminatory?

7	Is there any law that requires employers to have rehires complete new hire forms? An employee was hired in June following a last day worked in May however, we just found out the employee was rehired. This came up because we received a call from a probation officer asking if this employee let us know he was on probation. We're concerned because this individual's position has access to employee's private information and financial information including credit card details. Can we terminate based on our policy?	
7	I have a question regarding a new hire. We hired someone as an IV technician because we were not sure if one of our part timers would accept the offer of full time employment. The new hire has already completed his orientation and filled out all the necessary paperwork; he is supposed to be starting work on Wednesday October 4th. Now our part timer has decided he wants the full time position which we would prefer over the new employee. How do we go about telling the new hire we no longer need him and can there be any problems in this situation legally?	
8	We do a pre-employment drug test for new hires. We had a recent result from the lab of a negative dilute. When we asked the lab what this meant, they stated that most likely the employee has an underlying health issue (retaining water, diabetes, etc.) as the reason for the added fluid. The employee hired is overweight. Should the employer address this at all with the employee?	
6	Unregistered company: Rekt Global Caller: Molly 617-281-7456 molly@rektglobal.com My question is we are looking to bring on an intern. They are 16 living in NY state. Not be paid a wage, but there is an opportunity of stipend at the end of the internship. They are working from home remotely. 26 weeks for 10 hours a week. Do we need them to have the parents sign the offer letter? Do we need any type of signed consent?	
6	We have many seasonal employees that work from about November to April. We terminate them every april and then rehire them again in the fall. My question is, do we need to get a new I-9 form filled out every time they are rehired? Thank you.	
5	Q2- About giving a lengthy notice (3 months) having that in the offer letter. But still at will employer.	
3	I have a candidate who is based out of Texas. They were issued an employment offer and we started the background check. Something came back as unfavorable. Under our application where we ask for them to check a yes or no box she did not check anything. It was for petty theft and she will be handling money.	
3	The offer letter for our organization. Can I read the first line? Contingent upon the successful completion of a background screen could the wording be construed as meaning if the background is completed it is successful whether?	
8	A job seeker recently interviewed for a role with our company. The applicant had an obvious handicap, which the interviewer noticed, but did not discuss. Eventually, the interview reached a point where, after reviewing the essential duties, the interviewer asked the candidate, "Do you feel you can perform the essential duties of the job, either with or without an accommodation?" The candidate said, "Yes", but did not state whether or not they would need an accommodation. The interviewer felt strongly that the candidate couldn't perform the role, perhaps not even with an accommodation due to the handicap. Is it ever permissible to inquire about an obvious disability? For example, if a person applied for a job as a driver, but was missing limbs.	
6	Do you have some resources or examples to help me with seasonal employees who work over 40 hours a week thinking they are eligible for benefits. We have a lot of seasonal employees. We use a 12-month look back period because of the seasonality of our business. Is there something that explains they may be required to work over 40 hours but are not eligible for benefits.	
8	In order to do all the tasks required of on of our pet sitters/walkers you need to have access to or be a car owner. Can we deny employment to someone who is not a car owner?	
0	Ulli Barlass, barlassu@rainier.wednet.edu Do you have any sample reference check form with questions?	
5	Our company is considering requiring personality testing for applicants, for aptitude, customer service skills, etc. Is it legal in CA? Would this be done pre- or post-job offer? What are the best practices?	
6	We have a group who is trying to determine eligibility. Their contract state full time employees. They are asking for the definition of temporary employee. They may have temporary employees working 40 hour weeks.	
5	What guidance is there on contacting a known former employer listed on a candidate's resume but not listed as a professional reference? I know the former supervisor and I want to call him about the candidate even though the candidate didn't list him as a reference. Are there any concerns?	
2	We are getting new part-time employee. I just want to know what tax forms I need to send him.	
2	What is required to be given to new hires in the state of TN?

Your Question: We just recently implemented an affirmative action plan and are considered a government contractor. We haven't hired anyone yet under our affirmative action plan and I had a question. I had read somewhere that government contractors subject to VEVRAA were required to post all job openings for the public. We will now have our first opening since creating our AAP and possibly had a candidate that we have already interviewed in the past. So would we not be able to possibly just make an offer, we would have to advertise our job opening? Our Response: Because you are now accountable to the OFCCP guidelines relevant to the Affirmative Action Plan and VEVRAA opportunity posting, you must post the position and explore candidates relevant to meeting the skill requirements while fulfilling the AAP requirements. While the candidate previously interviewed may be a match for the position, he or she may not be the best match available and therefore extending position postings to relevant sources for candidates is now a requirement to demonstrate best practice and compliance with your contract.

8	1.For a I-9 form, for non-immigrant status employees, is the I-94 printed from CBP also acceptable ? Normally where can the non-immigrant employee find the I-94 form? 2. Does the employer address has to be the physical office address? the employer may have a registered address at another state. 3. Some SSN card shows valid for work only with DHS authorization, do we just ask for other files from List A or list B combining C? Thanks!	
6	Thank you! So we are definitely going to be paying our interns minimum wage, as well as keeping track of their hours. Is there anything else we need to keep in mind from a legal perspective regarding interns, or are they just regular employees at that point? I am asking for NYC and CA. Thank you!	
7	We had a candidate we invited to a second interview. The flight is paid for (he is out of state). A couple of reference checks came in and we have decided to pass on the candidate. He wants to know who said what, and I am not sure if I should disclose who made the disclosure. A director mentioned his name to a former employer and they said he was not a good candidate. This lead the director to ask another employer who said the same thing. He did not sign a reference check authorization. The reason we made to pass on the second interview was given to him as the reference.	
4	On reference checks, are there certain things we shouldn't ask?	
7	Background checks. Have someone who hasn't cleared yet and debating whether or not to wait until he clears or hired him pending final report?	
8	I redid the company's employee welcome packet. I handle all the paperwork they have to fill out. Is there someone who can go over all this paperwork with me in person?	
2	New I-9 forms - is there something new that the explains to use the form for all people hired after 1/22/1986?	
3	I'm looking for general guidance on ban the box legislation. We're based in California, we have a large group in DC and we're in about 30 states total. We're thinking of removing the criminal check question from our applications. We're a government employer. If you have a chart of all states that would be helpful. Also, can you provide confirmation that employers should initiate background checks only after a conditional offer is extended? Please cc: amy.simkins@sagepub.com	
0	Can you have a sales employee fill out their I-9 paperwork by themselves and mail it in if they work remotely?	
3	We require a background check as a contingency upon hire. Should we have in the offer letter that the job is contingent upon passing a background check? What happens if we hire the individual and then they don't pass?	
8	Group under 50 in CA, can they ask for verification for driver's license. At what point can they drug test the employees. These are employees doing marketing, and driving company cars. They are putting the employees on their insurance but they are not pulling a MVR or DMV report on the employees driving record.	
7	An employee provided me with an expired passport for the I-9 verification. Can I use that? I instructed him to bring me an identification and social security card. He only has the SS card, not an identification. How should I handle. Can we allow him to work?	
5	Looking to bring on remote employees in CA and NH. Are we legally required to register as an employer in those state?	
2	Does a company have to pay new hires when helping them complete their onboarding paperwork (I9's, W-4's, etc.)?	
6	Hello, We have an intern that is free through his school program. We had him sign a NDA, do we need any additional documentation? Thanks, Heather	
6	We're a government contractor. A client of ours is requesting that we build a pool of preference candidates that we can pull from in the future. How would we find out if they're veterans or Section 3 (low income)?	
8	We're getting ready for a fire captain recruitment. I've advised the fire department they are not allowed to inquire about personal information to avoid getting into the illegal pit of questions/information. I am told that it is industry standard to obtain a type of personal resume. Are there any type of exceptions for a fire recruitment to allow for us as the employer to obtain personal information, i.e. home life, family, etc?	
2	Hi, When is an employee's start date/effective date? When they actually work or when they do their new hire paperwork? We sometimes have a new hire come in a day or 2 before their start date to do their paperwork and take a tour. Would that be their start date then? Thank you.	
2	What states must provide a pay rate notice to new hires? I know NY does, any other states? Thank you.	
6	H1-B is active and we are in the processing of transferring it over to our company. When we hired the individual - they present i-94 and I have now received an alert from E-verify that their F-1 is expiring. Do we need to re-verify with a new document?	
7	New employee wants to stay on as an employee of old company to get commission check We have a new employee starting Thursday (10/5) and he just informed us as follows: Matt called and asked if there would be a problem if his current company (Northwestern Mutual) kept him on as an employee (not requiring any time commitment, or effort) for approximately two weeks, so that he may receive commission from a contract that he has been working on, which is scheduled to close in a couple of weeks. This would require no effort/time from Matt (i.e., he would be 100% committed at us), but would allow him to collect the commission he worked for. Are there any HR risks with this situation?

5	Sample offer letter with an introductory period?	
8	CA State Requirements for Position To whom it may concern, What are the job requirements and differences for a manager and director position within an organization? Could a manager be promoted to a director position if it is deemed that responsibilities are significantly increasing and the manager role is going away? I am trying to understand if there is anything specifically set by the state.

7	Q2- pertains to a 1099 employee. Self-employed. I'm wondering because we decided not to partner with a 1099 employee that we had conversations with -- We noticed some really odd behaviors - could not recall address we think he may be up to fraudulent activity and do not want to be involved with this individual -- Is there anything legally we have to tell him?	
5	Company with 20 employees (financial services) is establishing an engineering Intern stipend of $800 per month for first three months; $1,000 next three months; $1,200 final 3 months. Stipends and how they work? Letters?	
8	This is Dave Villar at PCB Insurance. I have a question from one of our clients and a user of ThinkHR. I am asking this question on behalf of Jai Inc, Electronic engeneering and sales, California 17 employees: Hi Dave, JAI wants to conduct the personality test to candidates at the final stage. I just want to make sure that we are cover our base as I know from previous experience that it is somewhat not legal in California because we have so many rules. Thus, I want to avoid law suits & etc. Therefore, I need some HR help if I want to conduct this test, what not to do & what okay to do on the test. Again, many thanks for your helps.	
4	We know employers may no longer ask for salary history however can an employer request an applicants salary expectations?	
8	I understand I have to send the pre-adverse action notice and the FCRA summary. Since this is technically credit report related, how does the FCRA apply? Is there an FCRA notice that is more geared toward the criminal?	
5	One of our former employees has moved on to another employer. The new employer is asking what specific plans the employee was enrolled, so they can match it (we assume). What is best practice here?	
8	We are going to make an offer with a significant signing bonus included. Is it okay for us to add in that if the new hire leaves before the end of the first year he has to pay it back? If so, is there anything we'd need to be sensitive to in how we word that? Should 'leave' be defined as by his own choice or the company's?	
6	Non-ICS related issue. My boss is involved in a 100% volunteer run organization for little league. Fewer people are volunteering, so the organization is considering moving to a payment system for workers. Some workers would receive an excess of $600 annually. Would these individuals be classified as contractors, which we can 1099, since they choose when they work? What other issue should we be thinking about? Workers compensation?	
6	Employees who are rehired what are some of the best practices.	
8	Good morning, Our organization has recently recruited for an internal position. The position was posted for two weeks and only one application was received. Given that the entire organization was given the opportunity to apply for this position, what would be HRs best practice to proceed with the recruitment process? Should our organization proceed to interviews with one applicant only (given the applicant meets the minimum qualifications for the position)? We have never experienced this situation; any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time and hope to hear a response soon. Best, Jorge Torres Office Specialist Confidential	
8	I called on Monday and havent heard back. I have additional questions. We have an offer out to an intern in New York State, who is 16 years old. The unpaid internship would be for 10 hours a week, for six months. There is potential for the employee to receive a bonus if he performs well. Is the parent or guardian required to sign the offer letter? What are the unpaid internship requirements? Do they need an employment permit, if the work is unpaid? Email: molly@rektglobal.com	
7	We would like to bring on an individual as a contractor, who is in the country on an F1 visa. He has a SSN and US bank account. What documentation must we require?	
8	We purchased a building and the owner of the current company is asking us to let him know if any of his employees apply for employment with us. We do not feel this is something we want to engage in. Can you confirm if there is a law that prohibits us from sharing such information? I want to be able to support my stance to our VP.	
7	We were in negotiations with a candidate for an open position. He was presented with an offer letter on Monday, after the negotiations were finalized. But after reviewing the red flags that we saw during negotiations, the company would like to rescind the offer. Are there any risks in our rescinding the offer now? The red flags regard his asking for a relocation package, and when we put the relocation funds in to his offer, we made it contingent that he would remain with the company for at least a year or repay the amount. Then he said forget the relocation funds, just pay me the additional amount as extra compensation. That made us very uncomfortable with his intent to stay on board with us.	
8	We have never had an employee with a visa before and we have an applicant with an H-1B visa. We need to know the fees involved, the length of the transfer application process. If her visa renews in 2019, when would start that process? In the renewal process is the H-1B visa cap an issue? Are wages set up this process?	
8	I found out that the staffing agency called Pared, is paying their temps through 1099's. It didn't feel right and I stopped all use of their services. Could the company be liable if it turns out they are misclassifying employees and placed one with us?	
8	We are the food & beverage company, which we have many stores both at east & west coasts. One of our stores at NJ would like to hire 17 years old for the cashier position, and we would like to know if there is any permit for the minors to work anywhere in NJ. (*This position does not deal with knives/heavy or dangerous machines.) When I searched online, I found A300 Combined Certification Form, which also requires physician's/principal's/school district officer's certification/approval. Is this is mandatory or is there any other mandatory forms/permits/procedure for hiring minor at NJ?	
8	Am I correct in telling a manager that it is illegal to disqualify a candidate based on past work comp injuries? A manager came to us with some release forms from the division of worker's compensation to check past worker's compensation records suggesting that we use them in screening applicants. From the forms it is clear that you cannot actually run a check until a conditional offer is made, but to rescind an offer based on past w/c claims, screams illegal to me. Is this accurate?	
3	I have an employee we ran a background check on and there was a hit but the employee has claimed that it has been expunged. We are trying to withdraw the employment offer.

7	Setting up interviews and only have 2 days available to conduct the interviews. One candidate says he has medical issues. We are going to invite him to interview but what if he can't make the interview date?	
4	Some jobs require drivers to be US citizens. Can we ask if the applicant is a US citizen on the application? Can we put that on all applications?	
5	I'm looking at an I-9 form that was completed in 1988. The employee checked alien authorized to work not the lawful resident box. But in Section 2 it says he provided an alien registration card.	
1	Candidate extended an offer. Accident on way to orientation. We have tried rescheduling a few times and each time something comes up. She was suppose to call us on Monday and has yet to call us. We are looking at rescinding the offer, do you foresee any issue?	
1	We sent a potential employee an offer letter. She indicated that she wanted the job, but wanted a higher pay rate (which we are not capable of doing). We feel now that she might accept the job even at the lower rate, but will be dissatisfied quickly and we wish to retract the offer. Is that even something that we can do?	
0	Can you provide commission agreement guidance and best practice considerations against our current offer letter?	
6	After running a background check for an applicant and they do not have favorable results. Should we verbally tell them we are sending a pre-adverse letter in regards to their results? Or should we verbally notify them we will not be hiring them based on their results right before we send the adverse action letter and they have had time to contest the results?	
5	Our job descriptions have a physical demand section which includes hand to finger handling or feel. Can I take that out?	
5	I'm redesigning job descriptions and I have a question on job components. Is it ok to say that the employee will be required to walk and stand? It is an office job. Isn't it discriminatory to do that?	
5	What about an employment contract that is written in New York and the employee is working in Wisconsin?	
7	Regarding candidate that we were about to hire. The dates of employment on the application did not match to his last employer. Candidate indicated he was still employed, employer said he was fired. We are rescinding the job offer because the candidate gave false information on his application. I sent him an adverse action notice and he thinks we are rescinding because we think he is a criminal. I dont know how much I can tell him.	
3	We are a senior assisted-living and are required to do a criminal background check with the FBI and DOJ per Department of Social Services. I would like to know contingent upon hiring an employee can I have all applicants sign a consent form to do additional background check such as liens, judgments, evictions, fico scores & etc? For the sole purpose to determine the quality of the applicantsi12 character if they are reliable and dependable to care for our senior clients.	
8	Brought on two new employees. Offered them a moving stipend to relocate to CA. Requirement are, they must stay with the company at least 12 months or they must forfeit the bonus, how do I word this in the offer? Can you send me verbiage for this?	
8	We have an employee referral program, and one of our employee's referred his roommate and during the interview process they had a falling out. The employee is now stating that it would be very awkward for them to work together, and he's further claiming that the candidate has physical limitation which would prohibit him from preforming the job. We have extended a conditional offer of employment to the candidate and I feel that acting on any such information at this point would be risky to us as an employer. I'd just like to talk through my reasoning with someone.	
7	We attempted to on board a new hire. We had to terminate the employee today because we got a tentative non confirmation on a SSN through e-verify. He is choosing not to contest it. My question is, are we as company allowed to employee him if he is coming through a temp agency? Does this information that we received about the SSN preclude us from being able to employ him through the temp agency?	
2	There are several notices we are required to give new hires in California (as well as Federal), such as the PDL and disability brochures, marketplace coverage, work comp time of hire, San Diego Sick Leave, etc. Are any of these notices required to be distributed in hard copy? We would like to post them all on an internal drive and allow the new employee to review them electronically and print any they want in hard copy. Is that okay?	
2	Follow up to prior case providing separation notices required by state, what new hire documents are required	
5	How does Connecticut define 'service workers'?	
8	We performed a background check for a new hire candidate. The report noted a misdemeanor for possession of weapon that was not a firearm. This was from three years ago, and the statement was that the employe did not contest the charge. What is the employer's responsibility at this time for hiring the individual? Noted the consideration should be based on the employee's job function, however, possession of a weapon could apply in most job circumstances.	
5	Is there a way I can word on a job description that we do not sponsor visas. 4 min.	
8	We have an open position that we would like to promote an employee into. I am new to the organization, and came from a government environment where the posting and recruitment of positions is very regulated. This employer does not have a formal process. Are we obligated to post a position internally for a specified period of time before moving ahead with the promotion?	
5	We put an ad on zip recruiter for open position - a person was already hired. Yesterday, sent email to all applicants to let them know the role was filled. Used template from zip recruiter - did not read thoroughly. Sample language around company error in sending wording 'not qualified'.	
3	If a background check comes back with multiple Alerts during Identity Fraud Detection, what's the next best course of action? Inform the candidate, the hiring manager, etc? Ask for additional proof of identity?

3	If a background check comes back with multiple Alerts during Identity Fraud Detection, what's the next best course of action? Inform the candidate, the hiring manager, etc? Ask for additional proof of identity?	
6	If we're going to hire a consultant, not an employee, at what point can we verify that they're authorized to work in the U.S?	
2	It's in reference to the new hire tool kit that you have posted, for the documents listed under the states, are these required documents or just recommended?	
4	If we review someone's criminal record on the WI Court System and it shows that someone was convicted of a crime and/or has any pending charges against them but on their application, they indicate the NO, can we deny them employment for making false statements on their application?	
7	We extended an offer to a candidate and he reached out to the manager, HR, recruiting, and VP and stated he is not comfortable with our non-compete and not being respectful and asking for double salary. The language is somewhat aggressive and threatening. Is there risk in rescinding the offer?	
8	This is the email we received for our Client Ibeauthentic: We are looking for an IT intern and there is someone we would like to bring in either as an intern or permanent employee who will require US sponsorship. Do you have any information about what the process would all entail? This is my first time working through something like this and right now just want to gather some information.	
5	can we hire an employee under the provision of a probation period of x months?	
8	We have two types of child care workers. One set is on staff working 9-4 on a regular basis. The other set is more on-call during ministry time when the church is open. Most of the time, these individuals are volunteer members of the church. However, on Friday nights we have a ministry called Celebrate Recovery. The child care during those times we sometimes have to pay people to do because it is an odd hour and the adults attending are in the program. Do these child care workers need to be employees?	
5	Can a company legally request a DMV record from a candidate before an offer of employment has been made?	
3	We have an applicant whose background check has come backing showing a conviction for a crime but it does not show what that is. We are a childcare facility, and by law we cannot have people convicted of certain types of crimes working with the children. Can we ask her about this conviction?	
0	We have used you before for background searches years ago on our account - do you still do that?	
4	May a job ad state" Salary commensuate with experience"? And may a job ad ask that the applicant provide expected salary?	
6	When we send an offer letter to a prospective employee, does it matter who signs the offer as long as the BOD has appropriately approved the offer? Is the offer considered a contract that would need to follow our contract-signing parameters? We would like to give signing authority to some of our practice leaders, but are wondering if we are required to have an officer sign.	
2	Should we provide a new job description to employees who are changing positions or rolls?	
8	Before offering the position, the employee stated they have full availability. After accepting the position, the employee stated they can only work weekends. Are we at risk for rescinding the offer?	
0	We have a standard employment contract and there is a first 90 days where you are under review. I want to hire someone for sure a trial period for 3 months as an independent contractor then if they work as an employee. Do you have sample offer letters?	
5	How long can an employer employ a direct temporary employee?	
6	We have three different divisions. Some do not require a physical, but some do. We are looking to get rid of the physical. Is there anything we need to consider when we discontinue the physical? I believe this is something that was just grandfathered in from before.

3	Our company's hiring is contingent upon a "clean" background check, as we provide personal care services to the elderly. What are our obligations regarding these background reports if someone who is not hired due to the information contained in the background check requests a copy of the report? All applicants sign a Disclosure and Authorization for Consumer Reports.	
4	What disclosure language (if any) is required on a job application in Massachusetts? i.e. polygraph, EEO etc.

I do have an HR question/situation I would like to have you run by the rep! We have an H-1B Visa student that is going to be working for us part time. I have all of the necessary paperwork from her end for her approval to work but what standard new employee paperwork do I need to make sure we have for her once she starts.

7	Hi HR Advisors, We are hiring an intern and he only has his Social Security Number, not card. Can we still hire him and how do we verify if his SS# is valid?	
6	Hello, We are in the process of hiring staff for summer camp which begins Mid-June. We have a candidate that has applied from Puerto Rico and we would like to know if there are special circumstances for hiring employees from there? We do not directly hire internationally, however we throught that we might be able to hire from Puerto Rico, since it is a US possession. We appreciate your response.	
8	An employer was extending an "unofficial" offer to an candidate first through email, then sent a final offer letter via email for a position GS-05. The primary extension of the offer via email originally stated "the salary for GS-05 is $18.51/hour." Then the official offer letter was sent reading ""the salary for GS-05 is $15.81/hour." The original salary of $18.51/hour was incorrect when it was provided to the candidate. Is there any liability on the employer group for incorrectly stating the salary via email? Thanks!	
2	Must employers provide a notice to new hires regarding healthcare coverage? If so, can you provide a copy of that notice?	
4	Can we ask a candidate to provide their most recent pay statement? An offer has not been made.	
7	New hire provided one name with hyphen on his employment application but signed his name without the added hyphenated last name. When running his background check using the unhyphenated name, it came up clear. Our recruiting team noticed he entered a hyphenated last name as his signature so they ran a public record report and found many criminal violations. We know we cannot take negative action on that public record report but we want to terminate him for providing us with a false last name. Please advise.	
7	We hired an employee on 4-18-17 at which time, on his I-9, he stated he was a citizen of the United States and presented us with a List B and a List C document which was verified through E-Verify. Today he states that he checked the wrong box on his I-9, is not a US Citizen but a lawful permanent resident, and he will bring that document tomorrow. Can I re-verify him using the permanent resident number? If not, can I make the correction directly on the I-9, date, initial, etc. and attach the new document he presents? Thank you.	
7	We are considering having an intern who will strictly be "shadowing" one day a week during the summer to "learn" the business. He will not be doing any work for us. That being said, do I treat him like I would any other employee? For example, background check, I-9, provide him with "new hire" paperwork? We have only had paid interns here so I do not know how to handle this process. Please advise. Thank you.	
7	Employee was working as Temp for a long time and we converted him to full time. We went through the whole hiring process of onboarding him. When we got to the I-9 he is now saying he can't find his paperwork. He was part of a whole group of temps that were here for a long time. We tried converting the rest to full time and they all said they would not be able to pass the documents test. The temp agency assures me they had checked their documents but it doesn't look like this is the case. The employee wants to know if he can be hired through the temp agency again.	
5	Is it necessary to fill out an I-9 if one of their documents expired. If they provided their passport and drivers license and one expires, do we reverify?	
5	Cindy Wagner with Crawford Advisors cwagner@crawfordadvisors.com Client: Can employer deny individuals employment because they are either not a veteran or American citizen?	
2	Good Morning, Is it legal to include new hire paperwork as part of the employee handbook? Our thought is to just pull out the employee handbook, turn to the new hire section, have the employee sign those documents and then make a copy of the handbook for them. This way everything is in one place. Thanks.	
6	We allow employees to apply for job postings, similar to external applicants. May we use personnel/performance records to determine if they are a good candidate? We have one employee that has asked to transfer to another department. She has a write up on file. How do we advise on this process?	
2	We have several different restaurants that are separate entity. We are opening a new one and current employees are transferring to the new concept. If we have the same new hire paper work but different branding logos on them, do we need the people that are transferring fill out new paper work or is that not necessary?	
3	We received back a background check and there is an items that says pending. Can we ask the candidate about the case? How much detail can we require about?	
4	Can we ask our employees to post something on their Facebook account? about our Job opening. Please advise.	
3	In Utah can we require any new applicant to sign a release to do a background check and if so what form would we have them sign and should it be included or stated on our application that we do background checks?	
5	I am looking for a template for the EEO statement in job postings for federal contractors. What is the requirement regarding ADA accommodation in the application process?	
5	Mandatory retirement age is 65. Would it be ok to hire someone age 66 or allow them to intern with us still?	
2	I need new hire forms for IL, FL, NY, TX	
6	If an employee needs to drive in between jobs, do we need to be concerned about them having a drivers' license?	
7	We recently hired a new Regional Sales Director. He had to have one of our Sales Reps drive him from one location to another, outside of the scope of what seems reasonable. The job requires him to be able to travel from one location to another. Can we ask him if he has a valid driver's license?

8	I am working on a job description and hiring/interview process for one of our part-time entry level positions. We normally require a high school diploma or GED for all positions, but we are considering listing this in the job description as preferred instead of mandatory and instead start using a skills test during the hiring process. The skills test would include having them read the manifest (two page document listing addresses and quantity for delivery) and adding up the number of bundles needed for delivery to ensure that they can read and add. What is the proper way to implement a skills test? Should notification or documentation of a skills test be included in the job posting and/or job description? What is the correct way to document and file that a skills test was completed? Thank you!	
3	Background check results for MN employee, a couple of pending charges have been found. Can we refuse the candidate for pending charges? A conditional offer was extended.

8	I would like to put the following statement on our job postings: "Mission Bell is interested in every qualified candidate who is currently eligible to work in the United States. However, we are not able to sponsor visas." Am I violating any laws? I have good intentions to prevent time being wasted for candidates, as well as for our company, but of course I don't want to discriminate or break the law. Thanks!	
0	Can you advise if in the offer letter we need to include explicit language around being a non-exempt worker, etc? Can you point me to resources that are best practices around this language?	
2	I and my partner are co-owners of the company. We are on the company's payroll. Must we complete all of the new hire documents?

8	Is it permissible to hire someone in IL on a trial basis based on metrics or quotas. Thinking about hiring sales rep..can we say for the first 120 or 90 day trial period and if you hit your sales goals it will convert to a full-time position.

3	Second opinion we started doing background checks this year. We do them on all full-time employees, but not on Interns, or temps. If I did put it in the handbook, would I need to write up everything we cover in a background check?	
8	Nope, it doesnt help. I actually stated that same law in my question. What I am trying to figure out is what is defined as Considered for the Job. Is that all 100 resumes I receive via email or only those that we accept and pursue?

3	We are located in the midwest and are inquiring how far back an employer can look into criminal history in running a background check. We are located in Illinois, Kansas, Iowa, Wisconsin. Does the FCRA apply to criminal background checks, if so - are we obligated to comply with notice requirements?	
3	recruiting, record retention, background checks, defense agains claims - details of laws, sample application, interview questions, etc.	
6	Lily Jade. we have a 1099 converting to FT and have some questions.	
0	We want to implement cognitive testing for our employees. Do you have any information and/or recommendations of the types of tests for skill testing (excel, word, etc.) and personality testing? Also if you know of any providers, that would be helpful.	
8	Do we have to have a "job description" for every position or is it sufficient to have "employee classifications" e.g. "Laborer: Person not using heavy equipment to regularly and skillfully perform excavation, grading or land leveling. May regularly use hand tools or powered/motorized tools to perform job. Reports to Foreman" AND "Operator: Person who uses heavy equipment as a tool to regularly and skillfully perform excavation, grading and land leveling. To include Truck Drivers operating highway legal vehicles in excess of 26,0001 lbs. Reports to Foreman"	
8	We have a client that has one department which is causing them problems with a lot of work place injuries. They would like to look into implementing testing for these employees. Would the be ok to implement pre-employment screens for just one department? (This dept is much more physical than any other dept) Is there a way they could test currently employees that are in the position? They have many long term employees so our concern would be that these employees would claim age discrimination since they've been doing to job for a long time.	
3	Are there any issues for advising a candidate that we can't hire them based on a background check we have done that came back with several felony charges? These charges were in WA and it is a CA candidate. We do have our offer letter that the employment is contingent about successfully passing a background check.	
3	Good Afternoon, How far back can an agency go on a background check for a candidate. Thank you.	
2	Where do I find a list of all mandatory brochure/information handouts for new hire papaerwork	
8	On our job application, if an applicant completes an application and they make a mistake and cross it out and write on it, should we have them initial it? Employment Reference Authorization Form - when I did a reference with a past employer I verified the job title and what the applicant wrote appears to be inaccurate. I asked the employer if I could read the duties on the resume and the employer said it was okay then she said to email her the duties and she could check with the job description. JOB TITLES: Housing case manager (employee) vs. Intern (employer). If we have already offered the candidate the position and we rescind the offer; what would be the recommendation for how to do that?	
6	Can we bring a candidate in on a conditional offer, complete I9 and orientation then once they pass their probation period, list that as their hire date? Additionally, can we give a potential employee a conditional offer and require them to go through training and paperwork and then hire them as an employee once we have a shift for them?	
6	How do I tell two employees who were qualified for a position, that we are passing on them? They just werent culture fits.	
4	Is it legal in the state of California to ask on the application if the applicant has been convicted of a felony?	
3	I believe we can only run credit checks on applicants who will be directly handling cash or in accounting. Just having a company credit card is not a sufficient reason to run a credit check. Is that correct?	
5	Hi there - Can you rescind an offer after a misdemeanor conviction of over 10 years old in Massachusetts?	
3	How can we protect ourselves from having to hire employees who have background checks that fail our standards? We allow them to start before the results are received.

7	We are in the process of hiring a candidate who will be opting for medical/dental coverage. His wife lives in North Carolina where she is attending college (and his home is) while he will live in Woodbridge (renting a room in a former neighbor's house). I assume since his primary residence is North Carolina that address should be listed on his W4. Any guidance you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

6	We have government contracts that require employees to be US Citizens and then we have positions that require a security clearance which requires citizenship as well. For the security clearance employees with green cards don't generally get them. How can we word this on our job postings? We would have postings just needing a US Citizen and postings needing a security clearance on top of that. Thanks!	
4	Can we ask a candidate to elaborate on the misdemeanor or felony that showed up on their background check? Can we ask about the details surrounding their conviction?	
8	1. I want to find out about possibly hiring someone who has an existing injury and what that could look like. For a physical position massage therapist. We have someone who has a hip injury from a bike accident. She is applying for a position. What happens if the employee states that she is finding the work is. Continue to accommodate. Workers compensation down the line? 2. I also wanted to speak about possibly hiring temp staff or independent contractors. I may be able to hire some people who were impacted by the fires and would like to discuss.

He stated it matters where the candidate lives for the San Francisco ordinance. I have a candidate that lives in Pleasanton. Does the Alameda County ban the box apply?	
5	I reached out to our contact -- We are looking at a US sponsorship for a permanent employee. What does the sponsorship look like for permanent employee? Does it have to be renewed yearly? Could be in Michigan or Wisconsin.	
2	I need a template for a new job application.

8	Hello, H1-B Sponsorships. Can a company hire an individual and this individual begin working prior to applying for an H1-B? Google search shows process can take 6 months to years to apply but an expedited process is 15 days - is the job title or occupation affect the timeframe of this process? What is the risk an employer assumes when they sponsor an individual? If the person quits or loses the sponsorship- can the company recoup any money spent on the sponsorship?	
5	In lieu of a social security card, can a potentially new employee provide a letter from the Social Security Administration stating that he does indeed has an SSN and that is the number is listed on the form. Will this suffice for us to hire this person?	
7	We have a job opening and the most qualified individual that has applied happens to be very obese. I am hesitant to hire him because I worry that he won't fit into our chairs, our chairs won't be able to handle his weight, he will have to use a step stool/ladder and will he be able to?, and things like that. (He said he could handle the physical aspects of the job.) Colleagues are divided on this. I also worry about what his presence will convey - we are a health clinic.	
4	For those states/cities that limit the employer from asking about a employee's past salary would this including asking about the salary on the application? Have you heard that this would become a law in TX?	
1	Employee in one department, as of this month, submitted note for medical accommodation (self disclosed anxiety disorder). They are asking to allow her to work from home one-day per-week, or remote when her conditions flare up. We agreed, provided a notice of understanding.

6	We are an employer in the state of Texas. What should I keep in mind when considering hiring and managing independent contractor employees? Do you have any sort of guide?

Example: Employer is not able to sponsor for work visa or Employer does not provide work visa. This is a statement of fact. Can we say this instead........ "This employer is currently not willing to consider candidates who require visa sponsorship (either now or in the future) in order to work in the USA."

6	We are a seasonal company and we need to hire temp employees during our peak seasons (Valetine's and Mother's day). I am having an issue when we rehire an employee that has been E-verified and the E-verified comes with a DHS TNC. We allow the employee the 10 days to resolve the issue, but sometimes they leave before the 10 days without getting back to us with an explanation. When we are hiring for the next season they comeback to work again, but if we do the E-verify again, we get the same issue. Can we not re-hire an employee that never resolve the issue the first time?

She started working, she was a red flag during the orientation. Can we ask about the court date for September 2018?	
8	We have posted a Part Time Teller (front line) position on our website and in both offices. The description of the position includes the number of hours most likely to be scheduled which is low (15-20 per week). My hope was to interest a person who may be attending college and looking for a PT position to offset their expenses and gain experience. I received four resumes - two are very probable (in the category that I expected) and the other two are extremely over qualified - in my opinion. Do all four have to be scheduled for an interview? Can you 'pick and choose' who to interview? Response appreciated. Thank you. Jeryl M.

We have our own recruiting team, who does the reviews of resumes, handles the first interviews and makes recommendations for who should be moved forward in the process. Then our HR department does the background and reference checks, which in the past has taken about 4 days. From there, the conditional offer is made and plans are made to onboard the new employee. About a month ago we changed providers and now it takes longer from one day to several weeks. We dont want to slow down the offer process. We make a statement to them Please do not give notice at your current employer until you have been notified that you successfully passed the background and receive your offer letter. But now, this is going to take longer. We do not give the offer letter until the background and reference checks were successfully completed and with the process taking longer, we don't want to lose otherwise qualified candidates waiting for the process. Can we talk about options?

7	We made an offer to someone and the person has come back several times. He is negotiating for more time to consider, we gave it and then he asked for more, then asked for more base pay. The way he is negotiating makes the manager feel he wont be a good fit. He sent us links to why we should give him more time. Now the manager wants to rescind the offer. We gave him until the end of the day to respond. Can we rescind?	
6	Hi there - We are thinking about rehiring some of our interns and former employees as remote independent contractors to do some project work for us.

7	We are speaking to a candidate and they told me that they applied for OPT but they have not found out if they've received confirmation of the application and he said he will not be able to start until December. If he doesn't get it we wouldn't be able to hire him. We want to be able to bring someone on as soon as possible. He has not graduated yet. He is in a PhD program, so he has submitted his thesis but has not officially graduated. How much can we inquire into the status of the OPT? We would like to offer him but if another candidate comes along earlier who is qualified, we would like to go with them and rescind the offer to this candidate. What are come concerns with with?

7	Our recruitment process is that we go through interviews and testing, then when we have final candidate, we send them for a background check. Once we get the results, we then decide if we want to make an offer. For a recent candidate, his background check came back clear (we check states where the employee has lived), however, someone who knew this individual stated he had some prior issues, so another employee did a search and found a newspaper article about this person in a state where he did not reside. The article states charges were filed for threatening a minor, drunkenness, and assaulting a police officer. We are now concerned about hiring him.

8	Hi! Do you have any guidance or SOP as it relates to converting temporary positions (through an agency) to full time staffed positions? My client is looking for either an SOP or policy that he might provide his managers. It might list best practice for converting, criteria to meet before converting (e.g., length in position, or certain skillsets/behaviors that are desired, etc.). This is intended to help guide managers on how to set expectations with their temps, as well as ensure a consistent and fair hiring process throughout the company. In the past there has been an unspoken expectation that all temps will be eventually hired as staff so trying to set some more formality/structure behind and supporting these business decisions. Thank you.	
1	(With a Ambica): JustWorks referred us to you: are there any implications or information hiring somebody from India with a masters degree - she has OPT and can work for one year. She is pursuing an artist's visa. Will she be gone by May? Is there a good chance she will get the artist visa? She would be a graphic designer. She's on OPT right now and she has classmates that have been able to get an artist visa and they have been working. If she gets the artist visa, are there any negative impacts to us? It looks like its an O-1 visa. She did mention she would do it on her own and she said its a lot cheaper. She has arts degree, not a computer science degree. Can we offer to take her on and try to get her a visa and reduce her salary? cc: ambica@eighty2degrees.com

4	Salary History - The new law states that employers are prohibited from seeking salary history information, including compensation and benefits.

Given the recent release date, and the possible severity of the crime based on the length of time, we have some concern. How confidential are we required to keep this information? Can it be shared with the manager? Can we call the probation officer for more information with or without the approval of the employee?	
8	We have some DOT regulated commercial drivers and therefore maintain driver files on them per DOT regulations. The requirement is that we run a MVR on each driver annually and keep in the file. My question is do we have to get a signed authorization from the employee EACH time before we run the MVR. Or is the one they sign initially sufficient since it is a requirement of their position to have the report pulled annually. Thank you.	
7	We had a candidate that we interviewed. After our manager met with him for a 2nd interview he had the feeling the person was dishonest, based on that intuition we decided not to hire him. The candidate has now send us a letter asking if he was "discriminated" against. What are we obligated to share about our decision with this candidate? Our process is to send a letter to each candidate we are not moving forward with basically informing them we will not be moving forward, but no reason why. Thank you,

For informational purposes, we are a small government contractor but we also have many non-government clients.

Is this appropriate?

8	My client is a restaurant and currently has a 3-day training period for all new servers. They are paid minimum wage for these three days, and are informed at the end of the training period if they will be hired. I am told that they are paid on different checks than regular employees and taxes are not withheld from these payments. Is this common in the food and beverage industry? What should we be concerned with from a compliance standpoint. This company employees roughly 500 workers at primarily one facility, but has 3 locations including a catering division.	
3	Background checks, we do our own in-house. Does ThinkHR recommend vendors who we could use to outsource this activity?	
5	How to handle contract workers that do not want to be an employee?	
7	We had a manager reach out because they had an interview with a potential candidate. He was really religious and outspoken about it. Her concern is not that he had religious beliefs, but how it could play out with the team. In every response, he tied it to religion. She thought he was energetic and deserved a spot on the team, if he was so outspoken about it during the interview, worried about the team dynamics it might not fit the team. Obviously its not a reason for the hiring process. We are imagining that he does start and he talks about religion constantly, how we would handle it with the team.	
8	We made an offer to potential employee. They accepted it. The only issue is we lost one of her clients so we are going to have to rescind on the offer. Is there any legality on that? What is the best practice to rescind a job offer? Can we send an email?	
7	I have an employee he is brand new. There was some debate on whether he was entitled to relocation allowance. We decided on $1000.00. He is saying that the recruiter said it would be $1500.

6	I attended a seminar where we were advised we could not indicate on our posting that we will only accept candidates who live in the immediate area. How can we convey this if this is what we want?	
2	If a person quit 2 months ago and then we re-hired her would we need to complete all new hire paperwork with her again? For the I-9 we would complete the rehire section but do we need new tax forms, policy receipt forms, etc? Do we keep their original hire date as starting date or use their rehire date going forward (since it is less than 90 days)? We do not have anything addressing this in our employee handbook.	
7	We have someone interested in doing an internship. He will not be receiving college credits for this summer internship, strictly would just like to work for free for the experience to place on his resume. Based on wage and hour, are we able to do this or does it strictly have to be for class credits only?

Anything we should be aware of in this process?

Can you point me to best practices generally regarding what companies are doing currently? THANKS, Zoe

I am unable to complete his I-9, because he didn't accept the consulting position and he wanted to see the benefits before we hired him, which is why we added him to the system. I had to enter a salary and entered $100. He was paid out as an employee in September. JustWorks recommend for me to change his status to a contractor, effective 10/1.

If someone can't pass it, do they get a second chance? Or how long do they have to wait before they can try again? 5. People currently on WC or light duty, do we wait for them to return to Full duty then send them to do a physical? Do we have to wait a certain period of time for this?

8	FW: Running SS Trace for New Hires Please provide feedback on the below process, and advise if this sequence is permissible. Thanks, Tina Tina Logan, MHR, PHR Director of Human Resources (615) 391-2522 p (615) 986-9648 f tlogan@swgao.com From: Cindy Smith Sent: Tuesday, January 31, 2017 1:44 PM To: Tina Logan Subject: Running SS Trace for New Hires Before e-verify our process was to run a ss trace to make sure that an applicant ss number verified through the Government, as our background check does not verify ss numbers. If it did not we told the applicant that they would need to get verification from the ss office before we would be able to go any further with the application process. This saved us money and time by not running a background check and not sending them for a drug screen. I would like to continue this process for cost and time savings , as long as it is still legal. Moving forward if this process is ok to still do - with verification of the ss number we would send the applicant for a drug screen and run a background check. After the results are received the applicant would then be offered the job and given a start date. I would then run the e-verify at the time I keyed the applicant into the payroll system.

From previous articles I have come across, it seems that's the best thing to do is to at least pay minimum wage. What is your opinion/advice? Also, lets say we go with a min wage pay for an intern: A) Does an agreement needs to be made just as we do with employees but stating this is an internship? If so, do we have to specify a duration of it? B) Would health benefits and paid time off have to be offered? if all the above is necessary, how is this different that hiring a temporary employee?

Potential problems are use bathrooms?

6	ThinkHR Question regarding online distribution of employee onboarding documents Hello, We are struggling to manage employee onboarding using paper forms and are looking at options. Two questions for you please. 1. As a first step, we'd like to load a number of the forms into a dropbox folder for employees' reference. We'd like to know what forms we can use for this method and stop printing in paper to hand to employees with an eye towards federal and California state law compliance. NOTE: We would not put any forms that require employees to complete, just the ones for reference (e.g., employee IIPP - Injury & Illness Prevention Plan, or employee manual - net of the signature page). I have attached an onboarding checklist with all of the documents we provide. If it is not clear, maybe we can walk through this material on a call. Please propose a couple of times and we'll do our best to accommodate a call and we can provide a bridge number. 2. Secondarily, for next year, we are thinking about finding an HR online/cloud system to manage the onboarding process, including capturing signatures from employees. In this case, we would ideally eliminate paper. We would also use this system to track employee information, pay changes, title changes, training session completion, etc. if you have a recommendation of systems to consider, we would appreciate some suggestions.

8	Are allowed to as this question on our application in California? Have you ever been convicted of a criminal offense (felony or serious misdemeanor)? (Convictions for marijuana-related offenses that are more than two years old need not be listed.)? * Yes No If yes, state nature of the crime(s), when and where convicted and disposition of the case. (Note: No applicant will be denied employment solely on the grounds of conviction of a criminal offense. The nature of the offense, the date of the offense, the surrounding circumstances and the relevance of the offense to the position(s) applied for may, however, be considered.)	
8	Applicant rejection confidentiality Afternoon, I believe it's best practice to not disclose reasons as to why we are no longer considering an applicant that a current employee referred to us, the employer. My question is, is there any legal regulation that protects applicant confidentiality? * Can we disclose whether we extended an offer or are no longer considering an applicant? * Can we give reasons as to why we are no longer considering an applicant? In all cases above, the employee that referred the candidate is not involved with the recruiting or hiring of this position - they are not a hiring manager of this role in anyway Best, Jane Moser 413.787.2260 1537 Main Street, Springfield, MA 01103 Moser@dennisgrp.com www.dennisgroup.com Atlanta Salt Lake City San Diego Sao Paulo Springfield Toronto #mainsig	
8	Our job applications do NOT include the question "Have you ever been convicted of a felony?" We have a client in Florida who uses our services and our applications who hired someone and then found out through a background check that the person was convicted of a felony.

7	From : rmarshall@case-agency.com Subject : Thanks, Beth! One follow up question.

4	Are we allowed to ask the following question on applications?

7	I-9 question. EE started 2 days ago, he gave a temporary CDL that says not a valid for identification, not sure it's valid. It does not have a DL number on it. Reason he got a new one is because he changed his name. The SSN has his old name, and he also showed me a copy of previous DL with old name. The school ID also has old name. He is getting belligerent over this. I've never experienced this situation before.	
7	We have a new hire who came in do timecard training and asked about some of our benefit paperwork which he had been sent to complete at home. He's asking to be compensated for the paperwork he completed at home. Should we pay him for the paperwork he completed here in the office and at home?

5	We're looking at hiring an employee to work remote in Idaho. Can you provide me with state-specific guidance we should consider given this will be our first employee there?	
6	We are editing our application form. We currently have a security section which asks the criminal history question. We know there are certain states and cities that prohibit asking the criminal history question, so we tell candidates in those areas to skip this section. Do you have any suggestions on how we should address this?	
6	For our website how long do we have to keep job openings. Are we allowed to look at one candidate or do we have to look at a specific number of candidates to interview?	
5	Rescinding an offer because the candidate lied about his education. Should I write a letter?	
8	When we distribute updated handbooks and job descriptions, should the employee sign the actual job description or just a form that says that they read it? If there is a form that we need, could you please send that as well?	
6	We are seeking to explore hiring an HB-1 Visa holder and understand there are processes we have to undergo to do this. What happens if we hire an individual and it doesnt work out can we transfer or terminate without issue?	
5	When posting certain jobs, is it ok to post only in a specific community and not to others? So for example, ours is a company with a vegan inspired mission. Is it legal to post for a job opening only in the vegan community and not to public job boards? Thanks!	
8	Our client is developing an "Interactive Interview Process," for future candidates interviewing as Group Care Workers (working with children, which sometimes can become physical). The job description would say that candidates needed to be able to lift up to 25lbs or so, but they would like to test this ability in a job interview before proceeding in the interview. They would like to ask candidates to lift a 25lb box off the floor and carry to a table across the room. Would this be allowed in an interview? Thanks, Dan

1	We purchased an auto dealership. The prior owner would terminate all employee. We extended offers to some employees. One that happened to be on leave was not extended an offer.

3	I have a client who is requesting background checks on my workers who will be working at their site. I do not provide that information. How should I handle?	
8	We plan to use unpaid high-school interns in the near future. This is new for us. We are evaluating whether to perform background checks and drug screens for these students, who will all be under the age of 18. (Our current practice is to run these screening for all new hires, including college interns.) The high school students are signing an internship agreement so another idea is to add wording to the agreement stating that they agree to our drug-free workplace policy and certify that they have no prior misdemeanors or felonies. Could you comment on these options and/or tell us if there is a better alternative? And also mention any possible legal considerations?	
6	We are currently talking to a head hunter about a prospective hire. The head hunter mentioned that the individual is moving to our area for health reasons. What are we permitted to ask about in this situation?

Does this document give her permission to return to work? In the Case Type- It states" I-485 Application to register permanent residence or adjust status".	
4	Can we have different job application forms?	
1	We are offering an internship and possibly offering to hire full-time once the internship is complete. The candidate informed me she is a permanent resident (with a Green Card). She should be treated as a normal US resident/Citizen with verification through I-9 with supporting documents verified. Do there need to be any other steps from the employer beyond the I-9?	
5	1) With CA ban on asking a candidate's salary history, does an employer have to provide a range if asked and they don't have one in place? Would the employer have to create bands? http://www.ocregister.com/2017/10/12/in-bid-to-fight-gender-pay-gap-gov-jerry-brown-signs-salary-privacy-law/. 2) Staffing agency revealed a candidate's religion.

4	Employer is passing on a candidate because of determined falsification on his application, they do not want us to disclose this. What can os should we not say or do?	
8	We hire at-will however, our executives are wanting to include reference to a garden leave. The reason for this is that if an employee received sponsorship from the bank for education, for example, they would like to address any reimbursement recovery. What are your thoughts? I think this contradicts at-will.	
5	Is it required to have an at-will clause in the offer letter?

3	When running background checks on candidates, currently we extend a verbal offer and then move into the background check. Is this best practice why or why not?	
6	If we terminate someone because of job abandonment due to a DUI. This would be for a sales position. Would it be okay if we re-hired this person. If we have a policy to never re-hire. Is that okay, even if we from time to time do rehire people.	
2	Our client, W.S. Newell, has asked if there is a program that will allow them to ONLY post their new hire packet and forms for hiring new employees. I know there are Ben Admin systems and of course if they had an intranet site they could do this but do you know of anything where they could accomplish this without spending money or at minimal cost?

6	Our position includes a required AA degree, if we find an applicant that does not have this - can we still consider them?	
6	If I have an employee that is currently laid off and I need to call them back to work but they are having carpel tunnel surgery and will not be able to do the job do I have to bring them back? They haven't filed a work comp claim but work with their hands and have been with us for 10 years. What is our liability. Am I required to file a claim for them?

6	We have several areas in our non-profit organization that use unpaid interns, and want to review our procedures. Currently we post these openings internally and externally, as we do with paid internships and job openings. We specify on the job posting that it is an unpaid internship. We interview candidates, make a selection, have them sign a background check release form, and then undergo a drug screen and background check. Once these are cleared, the manager completes our internal document ("Payroll Setup Form") showing $0 rate of pay and routes this to HR. We have the unpaid intern attend a new hire orientation session (which may be alone, with other unpaid interns, or with paid interns/employees). At the orientation, we have them sign their job description, Associate Handbook, and they also sign their Payroll Setup Form which shows $0 rate of pay. The unpaid intern logs their hours in Paycor, our payroll system, for tracking purposes. Please advise/comment. Thanks!

3	1. When we hire someone, can we run their reference checks prior to interview? If we go do a reference check on someone, why even bother doing the reference check if we have to wait until the job offer is made? We normally interview, run the reference check if they are a bad worker, we don't want to hire them. Is it definitely bad to do the reference check pre-interview then?

1	We interviewed an employee who previously worked for us and at the time I interviewed her I did not ask her if she she was eligible to work in the US or if she has or would require sponsorship for a visa. After I spoke with her I was informed that during her previous employment with us we were assisting her in acquiring an H-1B visa and during the process she left our employ. This was 2-year ago and we now no longer provide visa sponsorship. We do not know what was communicated to the employee. Can we inquire as to if she require sponsorship?

8	We do not disqualify applicants employment based on their criminal history report; however, we do require that they disclose any convictions prior to us running the report and failure to do so results in their employment ineligibility. Does that pose any risk? We do not have policies that prohibit employment based on convictions. Our only requirement is that it be disclosed on the release form for us to run the background.	
6	I'm wondering, we are posting a job. We posted it for 2 weeks. Do we have to post for 2 weeks? If we find candidate in this first couple days, can we hire right away? or do we have to wait the 2 week period?

8	Hi! We have employees (EE's) in CA and we complete the government-required wage theft form when they start with us. Our most recent hire receives a base pay AND potential commission each quarter. 1. What are we required to include in this form - base AND commission is what I believe, but please confirm. If commission were to be part of this form, will I will need to spell out the multiple criteria to receive the commission or can we just say "per signed agreement"?? 2. Is this form only for non-exempt EE's? In the following website, I see the language, "15. Are exempt employees, including professionals, executives, or administrators, excluded from the notice requirements? A: Yes, as they are not "employees" only for purposes of the notice requirement (Labor Code 2810.5(c)(2). Additional questions and responses added 1/23/12: 16. In construction projects where workers in trades are paid on a piece rate (e.g. expressed in measurement such as linear feet/yards, roofing squares, etc.) which are adjusted based upon complexity or difficulty of the job, employees may work on different structures or projects with different piece rates. Would it be permissible to provide a piece rate sheet showing the range of piece rates for each type of work? A. Yes. An employer can modify the DLSE template or attach a sheet to the existing template with a clear reference to the attachment in the space for "Rate(s) of Pay." The employer should specify multiple rates within a range the worker will be paid by the employer, including the basis for variation that informs the employee when certain rates within a range will apply (based upon stated criteria such as complexity/difficulty of project work). http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faqs-noticetoemployee.html Thank you!!!	
8	Our client is concerned that an applicant, who has a prior work injury that limits his mobility, is a liability. They want to implement a pre-employment waiver for both general liability purposes and Workers' Comp. I am unfamiliar with this type of approach; it generally seems like a bad idea. I would be surprised if W.C. could just be waived. Are you familiar with such a theory? Additionally, they want the applicant to take the job description to a physician and be checked out for this specific job. I think that is the best and only approach that does not discriminate against the applicant, and also protects against a future claim related to the employee's specific (and prior) injury. Also, the applicant may not be able to handle the job duties, and therefore, not eligible for the position. Am I missing any best practices? Is this advice sound? Thank you!

6	We continue to try to make a decision about pre employment screening. I always here consistency as a rule of thumb so that we should do it for each and every hire. Once we do it, and they have a black mark on it, can we opt in some cases to accept their explanation and in other cases not move forward with the hire. I have also heard that some wait to send the offer, noting the offer is pending these checks so we are not doing prior to make our selection. Please let me know how much leeway we have.

We do not do pre-employment drug screening. Wondering how much I can ask so we are comfortable with him running equipment this winter. thank you.

1	We extended an offer of employment to a candidate and she accepted.

Do we have grounds to rescind the offer?	
8	After presenting and receiving completed job offer letter, employee had areas that needed consideration. We submitted Pre Adverse Action letter while we considered. The background check company submitted the Post Adverse Action letter too soon, while we were still getting clarification if we could hire the employee. I instructed the employee that it was still under consideration and once we have a final answer, we would be in touch. Once I find if the employee is able to be employed, can we still proceed forward with employment even though the Post Adverse Action was sent out prematurely? Thank you! Matt	
3	1. Interview questions - I know the basic rules about illegal questions, but what about the inquiry during background checks regarding criminal history and WC.

7	We are considering a candidate for an accounting coordinator position. He disclosed that he has a visa making him eligiible to work in the U.S. We are just looking for some guidance. Do all visas require sponsorship? If we decide not to extend an offer to the individual how much do I share with the candidate?	
7	Someone we interviewed for a driving position disclosed before signing the offer letter that he will need to pull over from time to time while driving because he becomes sleepy. We encouraged him to be honest with our physician during the pre-employment physical so that if an accommodation is required we can do it. But I don't see how we can accommodate and what is our liability if he gets into an accident or if we don't hire him after this disclosure.	
6	Are there any legal issue's with putting an employee on a Inactive Status and not terminating them. We are looking at ways of reducing the work around hiring, terming and then re-hiring seasonal employees that will fur sure return after summer.	
1	We had a potential employee who applied for a part time position at a remote location. She met with the supervisor of that location and to learn about what the job entails, it was almost like a training.

6	We sometimes hire Independent Contractors to teach specialized classes in our afterschool program and we want to make sure that certain issues are addressed correctly when working with our youth. Can we provide Independent Contractors with Harassment Prevention training/Mandated Reporter training/CPR training or would that not be recommended due to their classification as Independent contractors?	
6	Who can be considered an 'Authorized Representative' to complete section 2? We have remote employees.	
7	We offered a candidate a job, wrote up a contingency offer, he agreed and signed it. Today was his pre-employment physical.

4	Can, and if we can, how can an employer inquire about previous workers compensation claims with past employers?	
8	We are creating a new position in the company, but budgetary concerns have lead to the role possibly being a dual role that would place the employee in the situation of being both the Supervisor and Peer of direct reports. Is this legal or is it a conflict of interest?	
7	Good afternoon, We are a law firm in Salt Lake City and we have just made an "Of Counsel" Agreement with a new attorney in Idaho. He will not be working in our office and we will be paying him a flat monthly fee for his services (this may be subject to change depending on the amount of work that comes in from Idaho). We will pay him as an independent contractor, and issue him a 1099. Do we need to complete an I-9 with him?

2	We're reviewing our hire and termination processes as it relates to forms use and reuse. Which forms are we required to issue when rehired?	
1	We hire an employee, and we sent her to do the medical. It came back with a limitation, and we would like to deny her employment based on the fact that the doctor found that she cannot fully raise and rotate her left arm. The employee will need both arms to use her job. It appears the employee has a pre-existing condition.	
0	Due to recent California legislature which prohibits employers from asking about prior salary information or prior arrests or convictions. Are you working on amending a California Employment Application that meets with the new requirements? Thank you Asking for our client Camp Richardson Patty Martino (209) 550-3734 pmartino@capax.com	
7	A new hire has just realized his current passport has expired. He has a driver's license but no original or certified birth certificate. Can a receipt of the replacement passport be sufficient?	
3	Background check items as they pertain to applicants. What can you ask before and after the offer with regard to criminal background?	
5	How does Massachusetts define "temporary employment"? How does Massachusetts define "intern"? What is the risk of keeping someone beyond the "temporary employee" time frame?	
2	Wanted to clarify what the date of hire should be as we require new employees participate in training before their first day on the job.	
4	Hello, I've read some interesting articles regarding banning employers from asking prospective employees their current/previous salary. I can't figure out whether this has been passed. Our current employee application does ask for salary history, is this legal? Would it be best practice to remove it, even if this has not passed yet, since it likely will soon?	
0	We're considering starting background checks. Can you send me general guidance?	
8	Are their any Federal and/or Florida laws that prohibit an employer from performing their own drug testing of either new hires or existing employees' random testing? My client is a private assisted living facility with RNs on staff. I thought I would suggest they view the government website: https://www.samhsa.gov/workplace/drug-testing#HHS Mandatory Guidelines to help them stay on safe legal ground. Any information you can supply is appreciated.	
5	One of our client wants to have an intern on a volunteer/unpaid basis. The intern is 17 years old; we would like to have documented parental approval. Is there any other legal considerations with this?	
3	For an employee with a DUI back in 2002, is that something we need to address? The employee will not be driving, however it is a sub teacher position. Candidate - it did come up on the background check.	
1	An employee provided us with her work authorization and copy of her birth certificate for the completion of her Form I-9. We also require a copy of her immunization record because we provide patient care. Her immunization record name does not match her legal name and she stated that her immunization record name is her Christian name and her legal name is her Muslim name. How can we validate that the immunization record belongs to her?	
6	We have a seasonal EE that we will be offering a position full time - when does their benefits start? I believe from the offer to be full time? Just as if a new hire? But want to confirm. Thank you!	
5	I need to rescind a contingent job offer because the potential employee failed a drug test. I was hoping for a template or any information for required wording.	
5	What are the questions an employer can ask a former employee who was terminated due to positive alcohol test and has a history from 2006 with 4 incidents of DUI? The employee was terminated by this employer in 2016 and is being considered for rehire. The employer wants to know what can be asked under the DOT guidelines? Broker believes employee was terminated after being tested positively for alcohol and needs to know what steps the employer can take in screening the former employee for rehire. Can the employer require additional alcohol testing as a condition of hire under DOT guidelines?	
2	Sir/Ma'am, I have a question about new hire paperwork. After new hires signed/filled out required documents, does the company make copies of them and give them to the employees? If the employee is working in the plant, can we mail them to his/her mailing address?	
5	Send - topics to avoid during a job interview.	
6	We are hiring an employee in the state of VT. What wage and labor laws apply? Where can I find the various employment forms on your website? If we must use a Notary Public to complete Section 2 of her Form I-9, can we use any Notary Public, and may we compensate the Notary Public? We know CA rules are restrictive on this matter.	
7	Are we obligated to share a background with an applicant/employee if we do not deny them employment? We ran a background on a subcontractor in March and he is now requesting a copy of it. He is from MN but did not check the box on the forms that he wanted to be provided with a copy back when we ran it. Do we need to provide it now? Is it a good practice to always provide it even if we do not deny employment?	
6	When recruiting we phone screen then invite for a face to face interview. Candidates are using the process to prove looking for work without any intention of working. Best practices to keep this time waste from occurring?	
2	Would you be able to tell me what on-boarding a new employee consist of? Such as the forms they will need to fill out (I-9, W-4, etc.) Also, when on-boarding a new employee what Notices are we required to provide them and where can I get these items? Such as Unemployment information, Paid Family leave etc. Lastly, could you provide me with required trainings employees of our company size should receive?	
8	Virginia: Recruiting Question: English is a bona fide job requirement for our stylists to communicate to our customers to ensure they are getting the service desired and for the stylist to be able to communicate and promote products to the customer?

3	Hi, I need to run a background check on an applicant of ours and she has only lived in the US for 2 months. Do you know what site I can use to check for a person from Britain? Also, if they were to be hired, what proper documentation do they need to provide for the I9 or proof that they can work in the US?	
7	We made an offer to a guy, he's been slow in returning the authorization for this background check. His drug screen came back just fine, which is weird because he seems to have something off with him. We called his previous employer and they would not tell us that he'd been fired or used to show up on time. We talked to one of his references and they seemed to indicate that his thought processes were rather odd. So, we know that there is something wrong with the guy, and we don't want to hire him. Can we rescind the offer? If we can, do we have to tell him anything?	
3	We ran background checks on a candidate, then candidate ended up rescinding the acceptance of our offer. How long must I maintain the background check results?	
6	We had an employee test 'negative-dilute' for a drug test. What can we do?

8	Must we put the "at will" clause in our offer letters? What is the drawback of not including it if we are in an "at will" state (Indiana) and have employees sign, upon hire, a confidentiality agreement that has the "at will" clause in it as well?	
4	Can we ask if a candidate has an arrest record during an interview?	
6	We have two employees who are applying for an position. Both have taken time off (one FMLA and one had approved time off). Wondering if we selected one over the other could one of them make a claim of retaliation for taking time off.	
1	We do background checks on our interns. An intern came back with an issue.She was charged with a theft misdemeanor. I looks like she was convicted but the sentence suspended and it looks like they paid a fine. This was 2012. Does it make a difference that its an intern? My guess is its a paid stipend. What would consistent with the job be? I have not seen the internship description yet. Adverse action steps? Consistent with job? Keep confidential? If I make a decision not to move forward, what can I say?	
6	Stephanie Mejia - NCHRA We are reviewing our application and wonder what should we take into consideration for CA?	
7	Hi. We are a small company in Pleasanton and we recently employed a 1099 employee. I just learned he's not a U.S. Citizen. Questions: 1) Is there any steps we need to take to ensure his non-Citizen status is legal while he is still a 1099 employee? 2) If we decide to offer him full time employment what documents do we need to have completed and submitted? How long does it take? Is there a website I can read about procedure?	
6	We are a staffing firm. Can we put on a job posting that the Candidate must be a US Citizen, or a green card holder? If not, what alternate wording can we use? The client does not want to hire candidates that are sponsored or need sponsoring.	
5	I want to make an offer to prospective applicant, but I want to know how to word a contingent offer of employment. Please call to discuss.	
3	We do business in California. Can we perform background checks and drug test before we send an offer letter or give a verbal offer?	
5	prehire assessment tests	
5	Our Alcohol & Drug policy does not state when we can rehire an employee that was terminated for failing a drug test? The employee was sent a year ago when he was under a reasonable suspicion. What is the best practice in this scenario? This question seems to pop up quite often.	
5	Regarding I9 forms, under section 2, there is an area where you would put in an employee's first day of employment. I am currently processing an I9 form for a temp. employee who is converting to a direct employee. For this date, would I be putting the date he becomes direct or would I put the date he first started as a temp. employee?	
8	This restaurant in Texas with 300 workers is considering removing the "90 day probationary period" from the handbook as Texas is an at-will state. The employees are eligible for benefits after the first 60 days of employment. Is there any reason NOT to remove the probationary period?	
5	Can you provide some general guidance as to why an employer would want to have a new hire probationary period? How would it benefit the employer and/or the employee?	
3	May we ask candidates about pending court cases that are indicated on their background check results? May we ask all candidates in general about any pending court cases, as we understand that not all pending cases will appear on a criminal background check. May we ask candidates if they have ever lost their securities license, if a securities license is not a requirement to work for our company? In the state of NY, how many years back may we receive results for criminal background checks?	
6	We will be re-hiring two employees. One left really recently, October 19th, 2017. Do we need to reverify this individual in e-verify?	
8	Good afternoon. My client has a question about an employer's obligation regarding paying bonus and/or commission to an employee that is terminating their employment. The HR Manager wants to hire an individual from a competitor but is concerned that the current employer will not pay this individual bonus and/or commission if he/she gives their resignation in mid December. What is the current employer's obligation to this employee? There isn't a non-compete so that is not a concern. Thank you. Deana Click JW Terrill / 314-594-2693	
2	Good Morning - One of our clients has received the below email from GA New Hire Reporting. Is this a standard requirement? If so, are you able to provide insight on this requirement? The purpose of this letter is to provide a kind reminder from the Georgia New Hire Reporting Center. www.GA-newhire.com. 888-541-0469. If calling in response to this reminder, please refer to Case File #30. We have not received any new hire records for FEIN xxxxxx since October 31, 2017. If your company has not had any new hires, as defined by law, please consider this a kind reminder for future reference. If your company has had new hires, then you will need to report those new hires to the Georgia New Hire Reporting Center at your first opportunity by way of www.GA-newhire.com.	
6	We recently laid off 13 legal assistants and 2 attorneys in our Houston office. We are now hiring for legal assistants in our Austin office, about 3 hours away. Are we legally required to offer these positions to those we laid off in Houston?	
4	In the interview process, can we ask if they have been convicted of a felony or been on probation?	
5	We usually don't check references for new hires. I have been asked to start doing that and begin with a person who starts tomorrow. I need to call his last employer. I just want to make sure what I can ask? Is it best to send an email, fax, or phone call?	
7	We run a hair salon and want to employ a foreign national full-time. He needs visa sponsorship. Can we provide this?	
3	In discussions with a temporary employee (through a staffing agency) about bringing on as a full time employee. Ran a background check which came back with two misdemeanor charges (one conviction and one pending) for drug-related activities. We do not want to hire at this point. Unsure if an offer letter has already been extended. How best to proceed?	
3	We had negative information pop on a recent background check - I'm looking for the examples (letter and report) to send to the candidate as well as any other information that would be important to know.	
3	We work with children so we are legally required to do criminal background checks. One applicants her background came back with stuff in it. There is nothing that would legally exclude her from working with children, however we would like to revoke the offer. Would like to discuss.	
3	Company is thinking about looking at prior WC claims via the background check. Is there any laws that prevents this?	
0	Is it legal to have "stages" or working interviews that are non paid with a waiver? If so, what are the conditions. If not, is there written legal that states when and when you cannot. Can you for hourly restaurant staff or kitchen employees to demonstrate abilities and skills sets? Can you for manager candidates?	
8	Client called because they were contacted by the GA DOL regarding a unemployment claim. They hired an artist for a temporary 12 week assignment for some graphic design work. The person ended up working less than 12 weeks and has filed for unemployment. They had her as a 1099 contactor and the DOL is saying they should not have been 1099. Looking for guidance to provide to them.	
2	We are not currently using E-Verify Subcontractor Certification for new hires. Is this something we should be doing?? Thank you -	
0	Recruiting and Hiring - reference checks. Do you have a sample form to provide to applicants allowing us to contact prior employers? They often list their friends and co-workers on the reference section of the application, and we would rather speak to former supervisors.	
8	I'm trying to determine if the interview question "Will this job be your main source of income" is a question that shouldn't be asked... and, if so, what regulation might it violate if asked.[the form submittal required a city/state, however, we have employees across 45 states...] thanks...	
6	We currently test new hires for drugs using a medical facility and testing urine. They use a rapid test and if it is positive send it out for further testing to ensure the final result. In order to save costs, we are now looking to use mouth swab drug testing and administer it on our premises. If an employee tests positive, are we under any obligation to due additional testing after that mouth positive mouth swab test or can we reject employment based on that positive mouth swab test?	
6	We do FBI fingerprinting as required by the state. We are moving to another vendor and many of them are advising against doing pre employment fingerprinting. Can we still do this?	
6	If we hire and intern and pay them a stipend - would they be considered "employees" and is the paid amount taxable?	
6	2 of 2 -We are hiring dietary aids that are in high school still. Do I need a workers permit? What do I need from them (I know what IDs I need)?	
8	We are a government contractor and we post jobs that need to be filled right away and also jobs that are contingent. The job states its contingent on getting government funding. In terms of applicants, is there a guide from OFCCP in how applicants can respond or not respond? Are they required to respond the same way? Say we have someone who doesn't want to go through the process because it is a contingent job. Do we have to follow the same procedures in the applicant process. They fill out the app in the ATS, submit resume, fill out disability and VET form etc. A senior level person was in conversation with someone who had not applied but they were not interested after. When do we have to ask for the demographic information? Can it be at the time of hire? A call back and if you get voicemail, email is fine.	
6	Melissa, HR Manager calling on behalf of Oscar. We do not have an employee handbook. How can we use your online tool? What is general policy for Holiday Pay? We have 5-7 employees right now, but will be hiring more in the near future. Where can we find new hire docs?	
8	When the employee fills out the I-9, is it alright if the employee does not check a box in the "Preparer/Translator Certification" section and both are left blank? Is that section only for if the employee is not a native speaker of English or a lawful citizen?	
6	We have someone who applied for an internship today - they disclosed in their interview that they are graduating tomorrow. Is it a problem to still bring them on as an intern. My concern is they could claim we were actually their employer since they weren't in school and we are providing all the equipment. Thank you!	
6	Hello! Looking for advice or language to use if we're re-posting a position that we were unable to fill with a previous round of interviewing. "Thanks but no thanks" letters detailed we were pursuing candidates whose credentials more closely matched the position. If someone who previously applied for the job applies again (seeing we've reposted), is there different language to use? Any other advice? Thank you!

6	What are some best practices for applicant tracking and selection procedures we should be sure to adhere to for hiring in Florida? We are looking at our current selection process and feel it can be tweaked a little. We accept applications through an online source which takes them directly to our website to apply. They can actually apply for any position even when there is no opening for that position so one question I have regarding that is should we send a letter of some type when someone applies for a position that is not currently being advertised to let them know they will need to reapply whenever they see that position advertised or just maintain them (forever)?	
2	When we hire someone as a company driver or as an office employee I submit a new hire report to the state. When someone hires on as a contractor, owner operator (10-99 employee) I don't submit anything to the state. Am I supposed to?	
8	This is about when to reverify any employees I-9 form. We have a student with us from Mexico who is working with us as an intern through an I-20 with an organization called Greenheart. On the I-9 we have on file when he was hired, in List A is his foreign passport which is still up to date and a Form I-94/Visa which expires in May 2017. Greenheart sent the intern an updated DS-2019 form which we now have on file. He also has a Social Security card which is "Valid for work only with DHS Authorization". When asked about the expiring Visa, Greenhearts response was: "The expiration on J-1 visa in your passport actually has no bearing on your ability to remain in the U.S. or your employment authorization. The DS-2019 form is what provides you with legal employment authorization in the U.S. The J-1 visa is only valid for your to seek entry into the U.S' We are wondering if there is anything we need to do on our end as the employer whether it's another form or reverifying the I-9	
6	We had a PT employee we termed December 6th (student that moved out of the City). We are rehiring him - do we have to redo all the paperwork?	
6	In CA, for a 1099 worker who has a set end of work date, do we need to pay him on his last day of work, or do we pay on the regular pay date?	
4	I am doing some recruiting for client, and performing phone screenings. This is for a very high level Administrative Assistant. Can I ask an applicant how many years experience they may have performing a task?	
7	Individual started today and submitted a passport that expired on May 2. He thinks he can bring in a receipt for a new passport, but I think it's only for lost, stolen, or misplaced documents, not expired ones. He said he lost his wallet and doesn't have a drivers license right now. Can he provide a receipt for a new DL by end of day Thursday? Give him I-9 form and have him decide which other documents he can produce. Birth cert or SS card. DMV receipt for DL with license number and valid.	
4	Hi we are updating our application and want to include a question about whether the candidates can perform the essential job duties with or without reasonable accommodation. Can/should we ask them anymore than just that question?

If an individual selects more than 1 race, what is the best practice for accurately tracking that information with the total recruitment. Should we count 1 for each race, or create a separate category for 2 or more races? I would like to be able to accurately depict the candidates that we are reaching.

8	We have a former employee that voluntarily left several years ago. In 2014, this employee re-applied for a position with our company and went through the hiring process, but was not selected. In 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, we have received emails from this person with strange, inappropriate comments. This person has also mentioned taking legal action because they believe they were discriminated against during the hiring process and that's why they weren't selected, but this is absolutely not the case. Should we be concerned and take further action? It seems that ignoring these emails has not worked since we're continuing to receive them. We have thought about perhaps sending a cease and desist letter and notifying law enforcement. Since there haven't been threats, we're not sure that anything is necessary beyond documentation. Any and all advice would be appreciated.

Others in the department have been working with her for a few years now, talking about possibly being able to bring her on in a larger role once graduated. She's now asking if she is going to be hired now that graduation is close.

6	We have several areas in our non-profit organization that use unpaid interns, and want to review our procedures. Currently we post these openings internally and externally, as we do with paid internships and job openings. We specify on the job posting that it is an unpaid internship. We interview candidates, make a selection, have them sign a background check release form, and then undergo a drug screen and background check. Once these are cleared, the manager completes our internal document ("Payroll Setup Form") showing $0 rate of pay and routes this to HR. We have the unpaid intern attend a new hire orientation session (which may be alone, with other unpaid interns, or with paid interns/employees). At the orientation, we have them sign their job description, Associate Handbook, and they also sign their Payroll Setup Form which shows $0 rate of pay. The unpaid intern logs their hours in Paycor, our payroll system, for tracking purposes. Please advise/comment. Thanks!

At this point, no conditional offer is made, but they are explained what we're asking for and why, then sign off to give us permission to pull their records. If we decide not to hire someone based off their criminal record or that they are not insurable with our insurance company, is that discriminatory? What if we decide that after a conditional offer is made since it would be a stipulation included in the official letter?

The candidate also revealed that they had a conviction of a "crime against a person" offense. Due to our business we are unable to hire someone with this type of offense.

8	We have a group that requires a "range of motion" test as a condition of employment for their technicians. The test is communicated in offer letters as a condition of employment, however the group hires people from across the country and then administers at a clinic local to the headquarters when employees come in for their first day of work. Would this cause an issue should an employee fail the range of motion/physical examination? The test is very specific so they cannot have it administered at clinics across the country, therefore it is not possible to give it prior to the first day of work. They want to ensure that even though they are giving the test on the technical first day of employment, they are compliant in how they are communicating it is a qualification for the job/employment is contingent upon passing it. Thanks!	
5	I want to include an EEOC tag line on our job postings on our site. Is there something specific it needs to state?	
5	When was the I-9 form last revised	
4	When I am doing a phone interview what questions should I ask?	
1	We have a new hire based in Ohio who, as part of the I-9 process provided a California ID and a voter registration card. She also wrote in her social security number. As part of an onboarding practice we always go to the social security site to verify the number and in doing so, her's came back with a totally different name. If she can't provide an accurate social security number can we refuse to employ her? We don't have a formal background check process per se, we just verify the SSN for everyone.	
1	We received a complaint from an applicant that the manager conducting the interview had a tone, mentioned her resume and experience was sparse, and overall the experience was negative. How do we address this?	
6	We have someone who left yesterday and has now come back. Rehire. Can we use the same Form I-9?	
2	Can we review the required forms and items for CA? Can we have those required pamphlets available online? For the employee handbook review and all new hire paperwork, should the employee be completing those before they start?	
7	We hired someone a while back on a work permit to work in the US. He provided an Employment Authorization Card, which expires 7/7/17. He is working as a quality inspector. He has recently just presented me with paperwork for an OPT. How would we determine if he would be qualified now since he was hired in as a regular employee? His work permit expires in July. He asked if I could provide a letter saying that he has a job. Would/could he be eligible for an OPT?	
8	* *From : *dgarcia@bluewavemiami.com *Subject : *Employee with Expired Resident's Card Issue Received Hi, I am reaching out for assistance. I have an employee whos Employment Authorization Card expired this past Saturday May 6, 2017. His Social Security card does not have an expiration date. He said he has already submitted all his documents and is only waiting for the updated information to provide us with it. Please advise if we can allow him to continue working or if we need to stop him from working until the updated documents are received. I thank you in advance for your prompt response. Regards, *Dolores Garcia*, Executive Assistant to Timothy Orr, General Manager Blue Wave Communications, LLC. 10330 USA Today Way Miramar, FL 33025 Office Phone: (305) 436-8886 www.BlueWaveMiami.com Follow us on Facebook - here ------------------------------ *Our Response:* Per our conversation, the USCIS has automatically extended certain types of EADs for up to 180 days. In order to qualify for the automatic extension, the employee must meet all of the following: 1. The employee must have timely filed an application to renew their EAD before it expires (except certain employees granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS)), and the application remains pending; 2. The eligibility category on the face of the EAD is the same eligibility category code on the Form I-797C, Notice of Action, the employee received from USCIS indicating USCISs receipt of their renewal application (except employees with TPS who may have a C19/A12 combination); and 3. The eligibility category is listed on uscis.gov as eligible for EAD automatic extensions. As of the date of publication of this M-274, Handbook for Employers, eligibility categories codes for a 180-day automatic extension are A03, A05, A07, A08, A10, C08, C09, C10, C16, C20, C22, C24, C31 and A12 or C19. At this point, the employee must provide a copy of their receipt of renewal they received from the USCIS for the employer to confirm that the category code matches the code on their EAD card. If the codes match and the receipt indicates the employee applied fro renewal prior to the expiration, the employer may extend the date for their EAD card for another 180 days on the Form I-9. More detailed instructions on completing the Form I-9 for the extension is included below. ------------------------------ *Guidance on Completing Form I-9 for Extension* For a current employee, update Section 2 of Form I-9 with the new expiration date as follows: 1. Draw a line through the old expiration date and write the new expiration date in the margin of Section 2; 2. Write EAD EXT in Section 2; 3. Initial and date the correction. The new expiration date to enter is the date 180 days from the date the card expires, which is the date on the face of the expired EAD. Employees whose employment authorization was automatically extended along with their EAD (such as adjustment of status applicants, but not asylees who are employment authorized incident to status) should cross out the employment authorized until date in Section 1, write the date that is 180 days from the date their current EAD expires, and initial and date the change. New employees may present the expired EAD and Form I-797C Notice of Action indicating USCISs receipt of the employees timely filed renewal application. When completing Section 1, the employee should enter the date that is 180 days from the card expires date of their expired EAD in the employment authorized until mm/ dd/yyyy field. When completing Section 2, the employer should enter into the Expiration Date field the date the automatic extension period expires, not the expiration date on the face of the expired EAD. The automatic extension expiration date is the date 180 days from the card expires date on the EAD. Note that this expiration date may be cut short if the employees renewal application is denied before the 180-day period expires. The employer should enter the receipt number from the I-797C Notice of Action as the document number on Form I-9. *Reverification * Reverification is required when the employees automatic extension ends, no later than 180-days after the expiration date of the Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766). Reverification can also be done before the end of the180-day extended time period, upon receipt of any document that shows current employment authorization, such as any document from List A or List C.

3	Candidate's background check has come back with recent charges during the last six months including arrested for battery and cruelty to children. Disposition of charges reduced to misdemeanor and sentenced to community service and probation for 12 months.

8	Unpaid Interns Hello, we have a client that wants to have "unpaid" interns for the summer. I provided them with the Dept of labor "tests" for unpaid internships.

2	Hello, I am trying to see what required pamphlets/documents we need to present to our new hires.

6	We will be having some interns coming in for the summer. They will be working for less than 3 months. Is is okay to have them working full time? We will be paying them.	
6	I recently discovered that we have additional requirements we receive funds from the federal government and I need some guidance on EEO. How long do we need to keep a job posting up?

4	Our MVR doesn't provide much information regarding the reasons for an accident. For instance, it doesn't indicate if it was at fault or not or considered a major violation. How can we find this out if the provider will not give us more information? Can we ask the employee for an MVR? Can we call the police department and ask for a report?	
0	Do you have a job description template that includes essential functions and physical requirement fields? I have been looking for a good sample document but have not been able to find one.

6	Hello - We are a nonprofit and are thinking about accepting an intern from a local university. It would be an unpaid internship. If the intern creates graphics or videos for our social media usage, can we have them sign an agreement stating that our agency reserves the right to any content they produce and that the intern may use the content for their portfolio only?	
6	Not sure I made my question clear enough. We would use an I-9 for an employee to figure out if they had legal work status. For and independent contractor we use the W-9 and they are certifying they are a US citizen or eligible to work. Is that all we need to do to or is there anything else to prove they have legal status within the U.S.	
6	We are a non-profit affordable housing developing company that has an independent Property Mgmnt Co. managing our properties. If we decide to manage two of our properties on our own, can we just hire the existing 2 property managers or is better to open the jobs for recruitment?	
7	We are looking to hire someone and we know that a candidate was accused of rape (no charges) and that is a concern to us. Is this something that because there were never any charges and he is a friend of an employee, this was years and years ago, what does that mean for us? The job would be producing and sales. This is because we know him and know his past.	
4	I am updating our 2018 Employment application, wanted to get your confirmation: We are able to ask for the desired salary, but we cannot ask for historical, correct? Can we ask if they will require VISA sponsorship?

Do we need to notify them during interview process of this or before? I can be reached at 618-939-8600 X207 if need to talk in person.	
5	Employee submitted an I-9 with an item from B and C. The birth certificate does not have a number on it but looks valid. Is this ok to use?	
8	From : JYoung@ncada-stl.org Subject : Thank you for your reply. Since we are a nonprofit, are we held to the same criteria as for profit entities? I read the DOL Fact Sheet #71 and a few other articles, and it appears that nonprofits have a bit of leeway, though the articles suggested that the DOLs language generally permissible - led to some gray areas. Regarding the one criteria, especially, it seems it would be very difficult for an organization to not receive some immediate advantage from having an intern, if the intern is to have a hands on experience.	
0	Just purchased another business in Kansas. Do you have a list of onboarding and offboarding documents we must give to employees in Kansas? Please also include posting requirements.

One of our new hires supplied a copy of his SSN card which reads the following: "Valid For Work Only with DHS Authorization". Could you please let me know what this means? This employee has also provided a copy of his US Permanent Resident card. Does the designation on his SSN card indicate I need to take another step to verify his eligibility for employment? Thank you in advance.

When asked if there was any conflict we should be aware of, she did state she was in a romantic relationship with a leader at one of our competitors. How should we close the loop with her on this? We do have concerns but would like her to reapply when we have an actual opening if her personal life has changed.

8	Is it required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act for every applicant for a driving position to sign the Fair Credit Reporting Act Disclosure Statement before the Employer checks the applicants driving record? We currently only have the applicants sign a MVR release form.	
8	I have a question regarding hiring practices. Can a company hire an individual and use a start date earlier than the individual can be available for the job? For example, if the company use Monday, June 1 as the start date, but the new hire cannot start until June 8 can the employee allow them to take negative PTO and enroll them in employee benefits prior to their first full day in the office?	
4	With the new law taking place on Jan 1, 18 regarding not being able to ask for a salary history or desired salary of our candidates; will there be training or specs on how we can negotiate salary w/a candidate?

8	A trucking client currently has pre-employment drug testing for their drivers which includes a urine test. They also conduct random drug testing for their drivers using a urine test. They have interest in utilizing the hair follicle test and interchanging it with a urine test at their discretion. They also may implement the drug screening company wide as well. Are their considerations the client should be aware of in making/administering this change? For example does the type of testing, urine vs. hair follicle need to be random? Can they dictate which test an new hire or randomly drawn employee would receive? Are their issues of discrimination that they need to consider? This group is located in Marinette, WI, but has employees in NY, IL, PA, MI and MA in case their are state specific considerations.

8	Is it okay to ask the following question during an interview? Occasionally we are asked to work late (Overtime) on such a short notice from time to time due to a hot item or something needs to be ship. Will this be a concern for you? I just want to make sure that we couldn't be considered discriminating against anyone by not hiring someone that isn't able to work OT.	
6	Are there any state or federal laws or regulations that state when completing the I-9 form for new hires, we need to also keep copies of their I-9 documentation (ie their SS card, drivers license, passport)? We have facilities in CA, UT, and WA. In WA, we are located in Renton, Fife, and Seattle. Is there a WA state law we also need to go into everify.com to complete the I-9? Currently, we do not keep copies of identification and only complete the I-9 paper form. We want to ensure we are in compliance. Thank you!	
5	Employer would like a sample employment application that complies with California Ban the Box?	
6	What pros and cons should I consider when operating as an at-will employer (we do have a displinary policy which provides guidance on progressive displine) and thinking about establishing a 90 day probation period? I have managers in Georgia that want to bring in employees with no experience and give them 4-6 weeks to be trained and learn the job but if they are not working let them go. I'm not sure where to draw the line....Legally what requirements should I think about?	
1	We sent an offer letter to a candidate on Monday. We tried to follow-up with her via phone with her an also sent an email but we have not heard back. We don't have a good feeling about it since she has not returned it. Can we rescind the offer?	
1	We have questions about job descriptions in general. Should the expected hours of work be listed on the job descriptions? Secondarily, if an employee was offered something different, for instance 32 hour workweek, rather than the 40 hour workweek, would/should that be reflected on her job description? It's in her offer letter and was created with legal guidance. Finally, if she refuses to sign her job description due to the "general expected hours of work are Mon-Fri between 8-5" would it be okay to allow her to make a note about the 32 hour agreement? Would it be okay for her not to sign?	
6	We are staffing company in California, but we have employees in AZ. Since it's a law in AZ to use Everify should we be using it on the AZ hires?	
7	An employee filed for work authorization through the DACA program. His work authorization has expired and he is applying for the renewal. Can we continue to have him work?	
1	As part of our pre-hire process (we have Head Start and several other agencies) and I have an applicant we extended an offer to who is refusing to have a TB skin test. She prefers a chest x-ray: "I have a preference." An x-ray is more expensive - 250%. She says its not a medical reason and if she can't have a chest x-ray she will decline the position. With regard to the TB policy "I don't feel that is necessary."	
7	We want to hire someone but we want to try him out before he gives notice at his other job. We are thinking of hiring him as a temp and having work a couple of Saturdays to see how things go.	
7	We are currently hiring our first H-1B employee. This person is currently on an H-1B Visa, therefore, we are going through the process of transferring his H-1B Visa to our company from his previous company. Can we put verbiage in our offer letter to him stating that if he leaves our company within a certain amount of time, we will require him to reimburse the company for the H-1B transfer filing fees? If we can seek reimbursement, is there any other fees we can try to recover if he voluntary leaves within a certain timeframe?

6	We recently opened an assisted living and memory care facility in Liberty, Missouri. We are new to operating in Missouri, and wanted to get some information on engaging in an agreement with an independent contractor. By state regulation, we are required to have an administer licensed by the state of Missouri to oversee the facility (employees, residents, daily operations etc). This is a temporary solution as we recruit and find a permanent administrator. Any guidance for working with an independent contractor in Missouri would be greatly appreciated. Pros/cons, legal requirements as an employer etc. Thank you!

8	I have an individual who we are planning to hire. Everything is ready and the background check came back ok, however, we have been advised that the drug test is pending. This means the lab will have to send this out to another lab, and then follow up with the individual if they find it to be positive. The individual is supposed to start on Monday. What is the best practice if we do not have these results yet?	
6	If we are hiring a CDL Driver (professional driver). Are we able to run a driver's license check before we hire him to help us make a decision on whether to hire him or not?	
7	We recently hired a vendor to do some IT work (our IT manager quick). Our vendor gave us a bill rate. Do we need to pay overtime? We wanted to extend this person a job but we said we could have him as a vendor and we are making an offer. A couple days he worked 8.5 hours while he was classified as an independent contractor. If we just paid the overtime and kept hire date going forward is that ok? I think his original agreement is back to November 15th. I think they have only paid him for one week.	
1	We had a little person who applied for a pharmacy technician position. She is a strong candidate for the position. During the screening and interview process she stated she could do the job with some accommodation. We did not ask her about the accommodation at the time. Can we still ask?

7	We have a candidate who we made an offer to, including a possible need to relocate. During the background screening process, information discovered was inconsistent with what he provided on his resume. When contacting his former employers, his job titles and work information was different. including the dates of employment. With two resources, they indicated he was still working for them. When questioned, he still insisted his information was correct. We have also noted that he actually applied for various positions within the company, and that the information on each resume submitted was different (relating to titles held). We don't want to proceed with the hire because of the inconsistency with his resume and even after brining this to his attention, he is providing conflicting information. Can we rescind the offer?

8	Via email: Hello team, I was looking for some help with language to include in an NDA. I want to mention something along the lines of an employee being committed exclusively to our company. Not sure how to appropriately phrase that. What we are essentially wanting to say is that the employee will solely be working for our company also, that they will not be poaching/hiring any of our current staff or clients. Thank you in advance.	
1	Kara Jensen and Director: My question is, my headquarters are in PA and we have extend an offer to work on Nov 20th. She end up not being able to start and moved start date to 27th o Nov and did not start and said she was in the hospital. Pushed her start date to the 4th. Doctor called and said another week because she has to go in for surgery. Do we have to hold the position? Can we rescind the offer? The offer was contingent, she passed the drug and background screens. She's self-employed. She was supposed to start on the 20th. She called with the flu and delayed to the 27th. She delayed again due to hospitalization. She was to start on the 4th. Her doctor performed surgery and called and is keeping her off another week and a half. We were in dire straits as it was. What happens if we extend one more time, and she doesn't start again? She had an initial concern with the commute when the offer was extended.

3	Hello Catherine, I know what needs to be conducted after we hire a CDL driver, but what I need to know is can I run a drivers license check before we hire him. Since the drivers license is directly related to his job, it seems to me that we should be able to run the license check before we hire him. My boss is telling me that no background checks can be done before hiring anyone, even a drivers license check on a CDL driver.

8	Good Morning, One of our Store Managers recently hired an employee who used a Social Security card as documentation for the I-9. On his card it says "Valid for work only with DHS authorization." The employee also indicated on their I-9 that they are a lawful permanent resident. What additional steps do we need to take in order to ensure this employee is authorized to work? At a different organization where I was previously employed, we used the e-verify site for the I-9s, so it would walk us through the steps in this type of situation. We do not use e-verify currently at Chuck and Don's. Are there any other ways to verify this person's work authorization? I did request that the manager ask the employee to bring in their permanent resident card. Any additional information would be appreciated.	
7	So I have an HR question regarding rehiring a past employee. We have someone who resigned 5 years ago and wants to come back. My question is what is the protocol on this, does he have to re-interview? I am assuming has to fill out a new application and submit a new resume as well? Then my next question is if he has to have another interview is it ethical to have our 4 supervisors interview him that worked with him in the past? Especially a supervisor who is a close friend of the former employee outside of the facility, and is the one that came to me saying we should rehire him?

8	Hi, We recently saw some e-mail material that states: California Governor Jerry Brown signed various employment bills into law last week, including a "ban the box" law that takes effect Jan. 1. The legislation prohibits most employers with at least five employees from asking applicants about criminal conviction histories until after a conditional offer of employment has been made. The governor also signed a salary history ban, which also takes effect Jan. 1. That law prohibits private and public employers from seeking a candidates pay history. Can you provide some guidance or more clarification on this? We are a company that provides supplier quality management and consulting services. Our company's HQ is based in California but we have employees in about 35 other states. Our Associate Development/Recruiting Department is based in California but conducts the interviews and communication with applicants, mostly by e-mail and phone, except for HQ applicants.

When I spoke to the owner we had a similar situation where the employee was on this program but we did not have to sign off on anything.

We do have the applicant sign the authorization form prior to requesting the background check. Thanks, Debbie DiNardi

4	We have a question on our online application process, asking are you Authorized to work in the United States? Can we also ask about visa sponsorship? We are a company that cannot afford to offer visa sponsorship, and are wondering how to handle that with candidates?	
0	Can you talk me through dealing with negative comments regarding HR impact on the recruiting process?	
5	Employer is traveling to various work sites. Some don't have copies/printers. Can they take photos of id's for I-9 on phone & save to print when back at the main office.	
7	One of our producers has the following questions: Regarding Medical Marijuana. Client extended an offer and did a drug test and physical. Potential employee said he uses medical marijuana as a means to help with pain form a head on car crash years ago. He has a Dr note, and now it is legal in Ca. How does the client respond? Can they say they have a strict drug policy regardless? Thanks	
0	Please provide questions to use during an interview (do's and don'ts)?	
1	Employer has a J-1 trainingship visa. They didn't have to do a full sponsorship, as she's working through an agency - she just came up with a training plan for her. They were told to pay her the same way they pay the rest of their staff but not to take out for certain taxes. She'll be here a year from Spain. Does this sound right?	
6	We are hiring two new employees, Many of our candidates are foreign citizens. Can we ask them if they need sponsoring?	
3	Our company conducts background checks on all employees as part of the hiring process. We have two potential employees that came back with a good social security number, but no name match found. Does this possibly indicate incorrect/false information given, or perhaps potential employees are not legal immigrants?	
6	We are purchasing another company. If we require the new hires to attend an orientation and training prior to their start date, would we have to pay them? Do we need to have them complete the Form I-9? Would that be their start date?	
7	We have a candidate to whom we have made a job offer; he sent me an email stating that he has diabetes. He is worried that he would have difficulty getting coverage on our plan or that it would be too expensive. My broker wanted me to call because he's concerned about the candidate sharing such information which could lead to a discrimination law suit. What should we do?	
2	I will be hiring a few seasonal employees for Valentines and the increase in business we get. What forms am I required to have them complete? If I hire an independent contractor what would I collect from him?	
6	Interviewing engineers and wondering if we can tell applicants we are not sponsoring H1 visas?	
5	exempt job offer language	
0	Do you have a sample job description for an HR benefits position you can offer?	
6	Our talent management system currently allows applicants to voluntarily complete Voluntary Self ID, Protected Veteran Status, and Section 503 Disability Status. We have over 100 employees, so we are subject to EEO-1 Reporting, so we need to solicit Gender and Ethnicity Information. However, we are not a Federal Contractor or Sub-Contractor, so we do not need to collect Veteran or Disability status, correct? Our HRIS talent management system allows us to turn this feature either on or off for all Voluntary Status Information, but does not allow us to turn off just Veteran and Disability Status while still soliciting EEOC information. My question is, should we be soliciting any of this information as part of our application process, or should we only be soliciting this upon hire?	
6	We are looking for some general best guidance for hiring. There is another school that is incorporating into our school and we anticipate we may be facing some turnover because of it.	
5	I have been having employees fill out an I-9. Am I also required to use E-Verify as well?	
3	What are your thoughts about informing a candidate how we do the background checks.	
7	I-9 question. Employee let his EAD expire a couple months ago and has brought in a I-765 receipt. I want to check if this is an acceptable document for continuing his employment.	
6	C.C. Geary, Joanne P. We are hiring a temp EE for a special project. Our CEO wants us to contract her (1099). Should we?	
0	Will you please please provide offer letter language for both a commission structure? Also for 94501 how many sick days must I give both full-time and part-time employees?	
8	Alexandra - we run background checks when we consider hiring. We run a civil search, and WC search even though we aren't providing WC results to the employee. For one employee there was a WC claim on lower extremities - ankle/knee. The nature of job requires bending, going under the car, and use of lower extremities. Having this report, can we ask him if this would be an issue? Can we tell the employee about the WC report and ask him some questions? Should we give him a copy of the report? What about informing the medical clinic doing the pre-employment exam?	
8	I-9 for remote employee. They don't meet up with the manager. Is there a way to certify their documents? They will be filling out the I-9 through our payroll system - electronically and we use E-Verify. Can we have a notary sign the I-9?	
0	Are we allowed to ask potential employees the following survey questions and hire the employee that score the best? 1.

You have a tendency to procrastinate until there is not enough time to do everything;	
3	We're revamping our hiring P&Ps. We implemented mandatory background checks for all new hires. One our people who has been here 3 months, came through an agency, for the first 6 weeks. I didn't process the background check. Is there a statute of limitation on running the background check? Can we run checks on people hired earlier this year, prior to our new policy?	
6	We are a Supermarket who at times hires an applicant for (1) day to perform a trial for us to assist us in determining whether they have the skills required for the position. We are currently hiring these trial applicants in our payroll system and are trying to determine if it is allowable to use a 1099 instead as to not need everything required as a typical hire if we may not move forward.	
8	If an employee has multiple felonies and criminal history and they ask for a copy of the background what is the best practice? Who gives the copy of the report?	
2	Any special employment laws that apply to a new hire who is 19 y.o? PT new hire, also enrolled in college. We have never hired anyone this young.	
4	Rule change regarding asking about an applicants previous salary history, can we ask for that information on an application?	
7	We have a new hire who was to show up today, and he did not call or answer his phone for most of the morning. We only got in touch with him a few moments ago, when we again called him. He is telling us that he got into an altercation with his roommate and that the police and his landlord had to be called. This is why he did not come into work or answer the phone. Can we ask for proof that this occurred? Would we be okay with rescinding the job?	
8	Working on job description and wanting to add the information regarding the physical requirements. For someone who is working with animals the options on your site are limited. The physical requirements for our positions are very limiting, but on the Job Description builder they seem pretty basic.	
7	A candidate has been extended an offer - he's gone to the doctor for physical. When he presented his I-9 information, he presented his CA ID number. He has no SSN card. His EAD is expired (C-10) what happens if he cannot produce something showing the 180-day extension? The EAD card says El Salvador, Category C-10.	
5	I was wondering if there are any issues with hiring an employee that is a Permanent Resident, but not a U.S. citizen to drive a CMV over the road.	
8	We have interviews tomorrow for a non-sworn position. Because of where the position is assigned, we disclosed in the job flyer that successful candidates must go through an extensive background investigation, polygraph, psychological, etc. Are there any concerns with the interview panel asking the following question during the interview: Do you have any reason to believe you would not be successful in completed the background investigation and polygraph exam? I thought it would solicit confidential information but AB1008 doesn't take effect until 1/1/2018 and the interviews are tomorrow.	
3	I am updating our application and understand ban the box, but what else should I consider? Background, credit, verification, etc.

1	We are a Skilled Nursing Facility. We hired an employee earlier this year who chose to leave her job. She worked for us as a cook. We are now looking at rehiring her as a cook. Will we have to get new reference requests or can I just use the ones from the first hire?	
5	Summary page for 2018 labor law changes for California. Ban the Box in particular.

7	She is interviewing and when he applied he stated that there was a back story about why he left his previous job. Pennsylvania.	
5	Thoughts on using social media to check out information on a candidate or applicant?	
1	Making offer letter. The position is an hourly position and candidate has insurance licences that she wants to bring in commission if she gets clients/sales. It's an hourly position but if you happen to bring in sales you will get the commission. Not an hourly rate to go prospecting. It would be outside the normal work hours. How would we word that correctly? Say employee works 9-5 and chooses to go to a mixer to try to get leads --we will not pay for that. Do you have sample langue for an offer letter?	
4	Can you ask an employment application if they have any felony convictions?	
4	We saw recently the law has changed and employers are not allowed to ask on employment applications what a persons criminal background is. Does that apply to us as well... meaning non-profit religious institution?

8	An employee wants to come back to work and has pre-existing back injury issues. How can we prevent from this becoming a workers compensation claim? Regarding a probationary period, is it ok to include include in the letter? Any suggestions for wording? Working interviews...how is pay handled? Will this run us afoul of ACA if we delay the start date (i.e. 90 day waiting period)?	
8	I have a couple of new hires who do not have a second identification to provide for the I-9. They have referenced an employer's ability to confirm their authorization to work online. Are you aware of what that is? I know it's not e-verify. If they provide me with a receipt that they've requested another SS card, can I accept the receipt?	
8	The CEO of our company is currently interviewing for a VP of Marketing position which will report to him. Our preferred candidate has sent in his references to us, and we would like to proceed with checking them. Two of the candidate's referees are CEOs. Our CEO would like to check the candidate's references by talking to these CEOs. What types of reference questions should our CEO be asking them? Would you have a high level list of executive referee questions to ask (from one CEO to another CEO)? Thanks so much. Dianne M. Spivack	
5	May we have an area of our employment application indicate the applicant check a box or sign: " I give permission for the employer to conduct a pre-employment drug screening prior to my employment with the company." We will then drug test only those to whom a position is offered.	
0	Do you have a compliant hiring application available for 2018 to download and use?	
8	Hi there. My office manager went to a recent CE meeting and the lecturer was talking about "Ban the box" where we could no longer ask if a California job applicant has a felony conviction. I'd just like to verify this because we will be conducting interviews tomorrow. Also, she was told that interns have to be paid. While I was aware of the requirement to pay interns I was under the impression that students that needed to do outside "externships" in order to complete their required training did not qualify as an intern. Can you verify this? Thanks. Dr Knox -- David A Knox, MS, DVM, CCRP (Certified Canine Rehabilitation Practitioner) Companion Animal Clinic 1215-A So. Escondido Blvd. Escondido, CA 92025	
6	Are there any issues with re-hiring an intern in CA? If we had an intern who worked with us for 90 days in the fall, but wants to work with us again in the summer are there are legal /compliance issues that would arise?	
3	Are there Utah laws that restrict a background checks to after conditional offers of employment?	
0	OK, so can we say if you refer your friends and family, well pay you commission, but we dont encourage attending networking events or other activities to actively solicit business on behalf of the agency.	
7	1. CEO wants to hire a new manager who has raving reviews from others in our industry. However, it has been brought to our attention through colleagues that the individual has a drinking problem outside of the workplace but it has never interfered with his work. We'd like to bring him on as an IC for the first 60 days to see how he performs. Thoughts? 2. Vacation accruals - we would like to front load, but can we require employees to use their vacation if they have a balance at year end?	
6	I am not sure we should be asking this question as stated.... Any violations of drug or alcohol policies during employment? I know we want to protect our students from any harm so I want to make sure that what we are asking is appropriate and not violating any ADA regulations. Is this okay to ask or do you have a suggestion on how this can be reworded?	
6	Hello, Thank you for your prompt response. I have two other follow up questions, please: - Is there a certain amount of time that we must allow to pass before we can hire them again? - Are they eligible for unemployment, should they file.	
7	We have a trucking company, they hired a driver and he left. He was in their employ 9/26/17 and 10/28/17. And they want to rehire him. They had a full DQ file on him when he left. What do need to do to rehire him?

1	We ran a background check on a candidate and it came back with a pending misdemeanor for driving under the influence. The candidate states she refused to submit to the breathalyzer. Her court case is mid-July. How can I handle this? Her position will require driving to event and different client locations.	
5	New employee negotiated COBRA reimbursement, how to include in offer letter?	
4	We saw recently the law has changed and employers are not allowed to ask on employment applications what a persons criminal background is. Does that apply to us as well... meaning non-profit religious institution?	
8	Hi, One of our newhires presented a SSN that says Valid for work only with DHS authorization . Can I accept this together with a picture ID that's issued from outside of the US, or must it be a picture ID that's been issued in the US? Thanks.	
8	I am sorry- I should have clarified - this question is asked to the Reference that the employee has provided....does that make a difference? Thanks.	
5	Potential New York client - looking for hiring/onboarding advice such as the correct protocol for hiring and an HR audit list.	
8	If someone signs a formal offer letter, are they tied to that contract if they receive a counter from their current employer and want to remain there or can they still back out of the acceptance at new company?	
4	Good Morning, We currently arranging interviews to hire a new junior project designer and I'm preparing to distribute employment applications. Of the 3 applications that come up on ThinkHR when I search "Employment Application", two ask for salary history, which I believe is no longer legal. Do you have any other resources for downloadable applications? Also, I know that we can no longer ask for salary history, but can we still ask for their desired starting salary for this position?	
6	We run pre employment background and drug screens on all new hires. We are hiring a Controller. Can we run a credit report on just that position? Piece rate workers - must we still provide the 30 minute meal break?	
2	What notices are required to be signed or provided during a new hire onboarding process for an employer in the state off NJ ? The employer wants to make sure they are in compliance with NJDOL and all federal requirements. Is there a checklist?	
3	We have a candidate whose background check came back with a misdemeanor for indecent exposure and we would like to rescind his job offer.	
2	I-9 question. Can a new hire complete the I-9 days in advance before starting work? For example we have a new employee coming in Thurs to complete paper work and her start date is Tues.	
1	We have an applicant that we are looking to hire. She passed her drug test but before she took it she admitted to using marijuana and was scared she might not pass it. Can we no hire her for that reason even though she passed.	
4	For W-4 forms (and DE-4), can we ask for these to be completed online and if so does it have to be exactly the same as the government forms in appearance or can it just ask for the same data? Same for I-9s?	
5	H2 visa - we have an applicant on an H2 visa and need to know what that means	
4	We called some applicants references and found out some information. I am free to ask them about some issues that came out of the reference check, correct.	
8	Hello, I want to assure it is safe/legal to change our policy to only hiring those 21 years of age and up. I know we would need a BFOQ to justify. Our staff really need to be ready and able to transport a consumer at all times. Our auto insurance carrier will not cover Turning Leaf Drivers under 21 years of age, and those with more than 3 points on their Michigan Drivers License. I would like to "grandfather" in the ones we have and label as "non drivers" and then moving forward 1/1/18 change our policy. Anything special I must "register or do" to hold a legal BFOQ? I am just worried, as I don't know if we have to explain the rationale to the public. I know you can't provide legal consult but just seeking advice. Thank you.	
5	An employee is leaving the company on 12/31/17. This employee may come back to work for the company from time to time for short intervals. How does the company classify/pay this person - as a temporary employee or as a 1099 contract employee?	
4	I'm looking for some guidance on what you can ask about in an interview.	
6	We are hiring right now and understand we cannot ask about prior earnings. Can we tell them what the position pays?

1	A new hire had started working without having completed the new hire paperwork. We called her in to complete the paperwork, and we then realized that she spoke or understood no English. Communicating with our members in English is an essential job requirement, although it is not indicated in our job description. How should we handle.

4	Employment applications - I understand that January 1 there is the restriction on asking salary history. Can we still ask for their desired salary? Can we ask why they left their previous employment?	
0	What, if any, restrictions or guidelines do states have regarding request for salary history on job applications? I would like to know any state, but primarily in CA, NY, WA and OR. Thank you	
7	I did a telephone interview with an IT candidate who self disclosed he had a felony from about 15 years ago. He did not say what the charge was. We are in Orange Park, Clear County Florida. May we ask him about his felony?	
8	A client of mine is in the trucking industry. Can he list a minimum age of 26 of the job posting?	
0	California Employment Application 2018 Do you have an Employment Application Form that will meet all the new requirements in California for 2018? Thank you, Sue Ashton Montebello Plastics Phone (323) 728-6814 Fax (323) 728-9942 sue@montebelloplastics.com	
8	I am creating a job description for our CFO. We have 2 divisions, a plastics division and a medical division, 2 separate tax IDs. On the job description, it asks to list the company name. I have put in Intertech Plastics/Medical, but he is being paid only by Intertech Plastics. Through GL, we will allocate some of his salary to the medical division. Is that a violation, should we be audited?	
8	In the state of MN, IL, WI, TX, and CO - can we include the EEOC questions (gender, ethnicity, and disability)? Optional? What are best practices?	
5	I know companies get credits when companies they hire people in certain groups, for example retired military. I want to clarify the form and where to send it too. I think it was the form 8850 but I'm not sure.	
1	It's a hiring question in TX. We have been attempting to hire someone to work W-Su. Typically individuals who have to work weekends work by themselves. We have been interviewing and we found someone we like. However, I have had a number of people saying I should not have offered her because she is a female and would have to work by herself on the weekends.	
6	We have independent contractors. Should we have an agreement with them?	
2	I need a resource that includes all of the required forms / handouts for new-hire onboarding in all 50 states (i.e., what is provided to the new-hire and either executed or just required to be furnished). After looking at the state law info in the Comply section of this site, and looking at every state, I'm not finding what's needed, rather just being directed to the different state income tax agencies. This would be very helpful if it's something you can pull for me.	
5	Does a new employee offer letter have to have benefits in it? Does an offer letter have to reflect the policy's and procedures or can a statement in the letter to refer to the P&P acceptable?	
8	I was wondering what the liability would be if we were to --in November we went through a RIF and the owner would like to hire one of the people back on under his own payroll as an executive assistant in CA.	
6	Can you provide guidance on determining if a position may be classified as an independent contractor versus an employee? We're recruiting for online remote work. We would provide initial training so that they understand our product and follow a uniform representation of the company. We will not issue business cards or laptops.	
5	if the company has a new independent contractor do we need to notify EDD- DE 34 form or any other information to comply with besides filling out the 1099 form.	
1	Question regarding a new hire and I-9 compliance. Can we reject a social security card as a valid form of an ID if it has the employee's maiden name on it and it doesn't match her valid drivers license that has a different last name? Apparently she never got the SS card updated when she changed her name. What can I legally do? Is her official date of hire only when she has the correct SS card provided to us? Please and thank you.	
7	My question is I am processing paperwork for a re-hire. He has been re-hired in the last 3 years. One ID has expired. Can I use the same I-9?	
8	During the I-9 validation process with a new employee, is it sufficient for the hiring manager to merely visually verify the accuracy of the documents provided (passport, driver license, etc), write the appropriate data on the forms (type of doc, expiration date, etc) and sign? Or is it required to make copies of the documents for the file? We have been making copies of the docs for years, however if we no longer need to, I'd prefer not having to do so. Also, since we do have I-9's with copies of docs, is that an issue if we now no longer make copies going forward?	
2	What are the required federal & state forms I need for hiring in VA besides I-9, federal/state tax forms, and handbook acknowledgment?	
3	(Eddie called - needs to be added by broker) We ran a pre-employment background check on an employee. It came back with 2 DUIs (2008 and 2011) and 1 conviction for driving with a suspended license. Can we rescind the offer? The employee need a valid drivers' license and the job requires driving from one location to the next.	
6	When we put out a job posting, we put "preferred to be bilingual." Can we put "required to be bilingual"? For CA	
1	We have a client who is going to be interviewing a candidate this afternoon. They have interview this person before for a warehouse position. At that time, she stated she had an ongoing workers compensation issue for a back injury. The position she is interviewing for today is a delivery driver. Knowing what she stated before, can the employer require she obtain a release from her doctor before coming to work for them? IF this is for a driver position, can they require she provide a clean MVR and/or a copy of her driver's' license?	
5	Adding physical requirements to job descriptions	
4	Can, and if we can, how can an employer inquire about previous workers compensation claims with past employers?	
8	Greetings! I have an employee who got flagged with a TNC in Everify because the last name on their SSN card and the last name on their license do not match. When we reached out to this individual about it, they told their manager, who called me to say the employee is very scared, worried, and would like to just back out of employment since their green card status is pending, & given the recent administration's behavior, they're nervous about jeopardizing their green card status. I'd like to understand how to proceed. I don't want to push this employee to go to the SS Admin if they're uncomfortable or nervous, but if they are legally authorized to work, I want to encourage them not to be scared, and that we'll continue to let them work while they get it sorted out with SS Admin?. Do we have any legal obligations in this situation? If the employee just wants to resign, can we close the case and leave it at that? Do we have to automatically terminate if they don't want to contest?	
5	I was looking at the I-9 website and it says that we cannot ask an employee to give us their social security card for the I-9 but we have to get their social security number for payroll. I'm just a little confused.	
4	Ban the Box - we modified our application last year but we left in the question about Conviction for felony or crime in which you served a jail/prison sentence. I want to check if we are still able to ask this question or if anything changed in the law.	
8	We have remote locations and have trained one administrative employee in each remote location to facilitate job hiring paperwork. The I-9 is tricky. Is it okay to have that administrative employee scan and send a copy of the documents provided to the home office?	
2	Looking for an Acceptance letter for new hires	
5	Are organizations, in CA, able to recruit interns at a specific year in college? For example, would my organization be able to post an internship opportunity that targets, say, exclusively, juniors in college?	
5	Id like to submit our current offer letter for the state of Florida to see if it's in compliance with State and Federal Compliance. How do I attach a file?	
6	Is there a regulation or compliance in applicant tracking Employers need to do? We are under 100 employees.	
3	Our managers get upset because background checks take so long. Fed/state criminal, education verification, SSN, etc. When can the background check start? They want to start sooner with the backgrounds (instead of post-offer). Is this allowable? What is the issue with hiring a person to start work BEFORE the background is back?	
7	Going to extend an offer to employee who lives in Florida but reporting to our Chicago office. He is a sales person and will be traveling the country. He will also have to come to the Chicago office from time to time. For payroll purposes, which state should take out taxes? Under Illinois or Florida? We do not have a business set up in Florida, so if we have to take out taxes base on Florida, how do I go about reporting taxes in Florida?	
8	A client is asking about the Marketplace Notice. Currently they are being mailed via US mail. Can this be emailed?	
5	How do we complete Section 2 of the I-9 form when the EE presents two forms of ID from List A?	
0	Good Afternoon, I'd like someone to review our application packet to make sure we're in compliance with all current laws. Please advise if this is possible. Thank you.	
6	A client just emailed me saying they are sponsoring a training ship for someone who is coming from out of the country starting Feb 15. They are not sure what they need from her from for a temporary employee here? They are in Illinois. They want to know what will we need to process the employee.	
5	Is it okay to automatically reject foreign candidates needing visa sponsorship? Are there any discrimination protections around that? Our company cannot afford to pay the sponsorship fees for foreign candidates.	
6	Good Afternoon, We would like to start running credit checks on all candidates. Is there any law that would prohibit us from doing this? or anything that we should be aware of when doing so?	
0	have you any examples of a contingent offer letter for a California.	
7	Historically, we have not sponsored employees. We currently have someone we want to hire, and he said he would take care of the paperwork. Can we do that without jeopardizing our previous decisions?	
2	Can you inform me when sending a new hire all their enrollment forms and tax forms, which tax forms we need to send for Colorado?	
4	Is it lawful to ask an applicant if they have ever been involuntarily terminated?	
5	Good Morning, I am looking for some sample formats in which an employer & employee sign off on a hourly/salary rate for new hires. Thanks	
6	We have an Affirmative Action Plan (AAP) in place along with an applicant tracking program. For executive recruitment, we do outsource this to a recruiter - should we seek demographic data for these positions?	
8	We operate shelters rehab and homeless. If you we provide room and food and the person can live there free. The shelters residents can seek assistant from this person after normal shelter hours ie at night and weekends. Will this person be an employee?	
8	A client of ours has all incoming employees take a pre-employment drug test. They recently had a prospective employee fail for marijuana. The position applied for is an office position weighing & ticketing trucks and answering the phone. How should this be addressed? Can the employer ask the prospective employee if the marijuana is used for medical purposes, as the drug test indicates a fail? Or, should the prospective employee be tested again to ensure that a false positive did not occur?	
8	If a school requires a background check as well as their fingerprints taken at the department of health, can they put the cost of the fingerprints on the applicant?	
6	Our question is in regards to hiring candidates. For our final candidates we run background checks. We use a third party vendor to do the background check. If they state no do not contact current employer. In this case we do not contact them during the recruiting process, but we sometimes do contact them after they have already started with us. We have one candidate who is requesting that we only ask a few types of questions, terms of employment, date, etc. and that we dont speak with her supervisor. We usually talk with the supervisor/manager as a reference after they are hired. Can we do this?	
8	Follow up to yesterday's inquiry: I have not been doing any new hire reporting since I started with the company in June. We have employees that we have hired in CA, CO and TX. How do I manage reporting those who have already been hired? In the past, my payroll companies did this function for me, and this is the first company that manages payroll in-house.

8	We have extended an offer to an individual we do criminal and driving and the offer was contingent. At the time they accepted the position they stated that they had a criminal record 20 years ago. I am still waiting on the results. What is the industry norm when there is a conviction on an individual's background screen?	
6	We have a team lead position opening up and typically we post the positions internally to give everyone interested an opportunity to apply. However, we have already identified an employee we feel would be the best fit for the position. Do we have to post it internally or can we just move her into the role?

What do we really need to be asking from applicants. there is no certification that the information submitted is correct.

6	I would like to know if I can get some guidance regarding drug testing our employees. We want to prohibit employees being under the influence while on our company grounds. We'd also like to implement a rule of putting them through a drug test when a mistake is made. How can we make sure this is legal to enforce in our company?

7	One of our offices has started a training program that lasts 5 days at 8 hours a day in order to see if a candidate would be a good fit for the company. If they are, he hires them on the team and they fill out paperwork at that time. He would rather not pay them for this training week, but if he has to, what are the rules surrounding a hiring process like this? What kind of paperwork would we need to have the employee fill out prior to the start of training?	
3	Criminal Background check. We run all new hires after they are offered a position. We have received a background check for 2 thefts and fraud charges that were dismissed but were within the last 7 years and a bit concerning. Employment is contingent upon check. Would like to discuss rescinding the offer. The offer has been made and is continent upon the check. What can we do to get more detail from the candidate? These were felonies of thefts over $1k. This position handles a lot of cash and fraud is the other concern - identity theft misuse. Since our patients' information would be available, this is a concern. Do we follow the FCRA rules since we only go through the Colorado Bureau of Investigation? Can we confirm? https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cbi/employment-background-checks

8	Good Morning, Question: Employee has been working 3 years doing all Human Resource responsibilities, including being responsible for reports and data as required by Directors of Departments in our firm. HR was not a department in our firm until 3 years ago, Prior to that we had less than 50 employees and paperwork was given out to employees by the accounting department. We have now grown to 95 and soon to be over 100 in 2018 and still growing. The employee that has been doing the work and building the HR department from the ground up was called in a meeting last week and told more staff was going to be hired to assist in the growing company and the first position was going to be a Director. The employee was told they were welcome to apply for the job.

6	I-9 Good evening, We had a unique request and would like some guidance. Can we complete an I-9 on behalf of another non-profit organization, to verify an out-of-state employee?	
0	I was just wondering if there are any work form home regulations and laws in CA. We are trying to implement a work from home policy. Do you have a sample? What should and should not be included?	
8	I'm having trouble with my ATS - it's not collecting employment history, information, phone numbers. Most applicants are uploading a resume. My thought is that I will have to reach out to everybody that has applied to ask them to enter the information. A director is challenging this, because we have the resume. I understand the application becomes a legal document? Many positions are basic laborer, custodians, driver helpers, warehouse and many of them do not have a resume. I was going to send a blast email from the ATS that application was incomplete. The IT Director thinks we do not need to because the resume was uploaded. Can you confirm whether an employment application is a legal document?	
8	Question re: Massachusetts Client Good evening, We have a client in Massachusetts asking if they can proceed with the bolded wording below? Feedback I got from arecruiting agroup when I mentioned that this is 10 month position with $50K-$60K salary range (translates into $60K-$72K on a 12 month scale) with full benefits, they were impressed with how strong the pay was (which we knew since the nation avg for this type of job is $35K). I stressed to them it is $1M revenue and ~70 seasonal staff responsibility that you cannot hire a kid a few years out of college to do. Regardless, they felt the pay was extremely competitive. They asked how we approach vacation on this position. I think since this is a 10-month cycle like faculty, we should do away with additional vacation time. We should have the standard sick days and off during 2 months specified and maybe throw in 2 personal days.	
8	Offer of employment was issued and we just received her signed acceptance then discovered that all interviews were done over the telephone and no one has met the candidate or even knows if the person offered the job is the same person who interviewed over the telephone. Employer would like to rescind offer and invite this person to reapply when she moves to Idaho and can have an in-person interview per company process. Considerations?	
7	We have an employee is currently going through the hiring process. He has signed the acknowledgement that he can perform the required job duties, and he has passed the pre-employment physical. He did mention, however, that his knee was a bit sore. He was asked if he was on crutches or in a wheelchair, and he indicated no, that it was just sore. What, if anything, can we do in this circumstance?	
7	A new hire checked the box on his Form I-9 that he is not a US Citizen. But he gave us a state issued ID, and an unrestricted SS card. Shoudlnt he have given us a document validating his non citizen status?	
6	We are VA based employer and looking to extend offer of employment to someone who will be based in VA and will also be based in CA for six months. My question is, for this type of arrangement, would we have to follow all CA laws even though it is a temporary arrangement in CA or can we use the same one we use for VA. Anything else we would need to be aware of? They are in the in Arcadia , CA 91006. They would be working from home for 6 months then moving to VA.	
2	Form I-9 for rehires - what are the rules for a new one being completed? Other new hire docs, Form W-4, DE-4, etc. do new ones for each new hire?	
8	For the last two years any one in a proprietary information role upon being offered a job need to agree to a non-compete agreement. Someone is fighting back on the language in it. We do not care if they work for a competitor. How do I say this without actually saying it?

8	Hello, I have been looking into the potential risk areas and legal ramifications associated with "Cyber-Vetting" employees prior to a conditional offer of employment. I have recently become aware that some of our supervisors charged with pre-screening resumes have taken to examining applicants' social media profiles for additional information. I have reviewed the FCRA and ICRAA and am having trouble discerning what (if any) differences there are in our obligation to obtain an applicant's consent and/or provide copies of the information reviewed/reported prior to having a third party screen applicants (we don't ask our screening agency to search social media) and when we perform these searches internally. In addition to the risk that accompanies the discovery of applicants' protected characteristics, are we obligated to treat internal social media screening the same as we treat full consumer reports delegated to a third party?	
2	Are we required to have active employee complete the most recent I-9 form or only new hires going forward?

3	Im being advised to review our application form in light of the Ban-The-Box law going into effect on January 1, 2018. Our in-house counsel asked me to find case law or statutory law on what in not allowed on the application. The latest version of application asks the candidate to answer each question completely and failure to do so results in no consideration. There is a box they have to check off that references criminal history. Im not comfortable leaving it on the form. Can I run credit history background checks during application process for Collectors and data entry people? Our CEO wants to keep this on the application because candidates should know we will be running these checks after a conditional offer of employment. What date can will use on the background check? Is it still possible to check references prior to making an offer?	
3	A California client has between 50 and 100 employees and would like to conduct criminal background checks. I want to understand what the requirements are regarding when and how often an employee can appeal the results of a background check (i.e. if they appeal once and the employer denies, can they appeal again?). What exactly are the employer and employee's rights in this process and how should it work in terms of required documentation and steps? If you need additional information please feel free to call me at: 818-610-7083	
7	Rebecca- (caller) 714-575-8901 rebecca@horizonoxygen.com. My question is regarding a criminal history for an applicant and how to proceed. We had someone we were interviewing for a patient service technician (they go into people's homes and hospice). He mentioned he had a federal criminal record for crossing international lines with controlled substances. This was back in 2007 and he is still is doing drug counseling for it. Is it worth proceeding with the hiring process? His driving record is clean. His resume only goes back to 2015. The branch manager thought it was an automatic no...? He likes the candidate. We talked to our attorney, who is also looking into it.	
8	We are a staffing company. We hired someone to work at a client's facility, however, when they discovered the person was related to one of their employees, the were not happy as they felt we should have screened for this. Is there anything wrong with us asking this type of a question?

CEG is committed to building a culturally diverse staff and strongly encourages applications from female and minority candidates. More to the point, we are pretty equal on male/female and specifically desire someone that is Hispanic or African American. That said, is it better to leave the word female in the above or should it just be a minority candidate	
8	I would like to ask about I-9 form. USCI often update the form. What is the newest version? We use the form, 07/17/2017 updated, 8/31/2019 expires. Is this correct form to use?

We are going to provide a separate applicant statement and agreement for the candidate to sign which includes an authorization to check references. dispute resolution, at-will employment, etc. Once we make the conditional offer, then we write the letter to confirm we are running background check. Then, we will look at criminal background. If there is something that comes up we feel would cause reason to withdraw the offer, adverse action, 5 days. We have to provide that in writing. Is this correct?	
4	In an interview is it ok to ask an applicant if they have ever filed for unemployment?	
7	We made a verbal offer to a candidate last wk to be a Relief Route Salesperson - working in the trade making beverage deliveries and merchandising the product at customer sites. In doing the WI background check I have uncovered this candidate was convicted misdemeanor for battery & another arrest for resisting an officer in '93. Then aggravated battery/intent-great harm convicted in '95. In '13 a prob violation. Nothing was showing up why the prob violation until I googled and he was booked for something in '18 in MN but I don't know what. Then there is an article that he was sentenced to 5 yrs prob in '12 for admitting to possession of & conspiracy to distribute anabolic steriods. I had also asked him about his driving record and he said it was clean. His MVR came back with a 1999 Operating while intox & '15 Unreg veh. We not longer want to proceed with an offer. I know there have been new regs/laws. Can we tell him we are not making a for formal offer due to neg bkgrnd ck?	
7	We have an employee who still has not produced another form of ID for the form I-9. What are my next steps? They have moved and he states the documents are packed away. He has produced a valid Texas DL and an expired passport.	
6	I can't find this in our handbook...If we rehire an employee, how long do we have to do we have to wait to do a background check if they are rehired within the same year or 6 months? The employee is in Iowa.	
7	We had a person come into apply. When it came to I-9 he didn't fill out if citizen or permanent resident or employee authorization card. When we asked if he was permanent resident, he said no. He filled nothing out on I-9. What can we do to proceed? The employee is waiting to hear from us. The manager was confused because he wouldn't tell her if he was a resident or has authorization. He has a CA license and a SSN. I don't know if she made him in as offer - she asked him in English in Spanish if he could legally work in the US and he said no. He was previously employed for over 20 years. He showed the I-9 and social security card but wouldn't complete that Section. He brought it to our attention that he couldn't complete the boxes bu not completing it.	
6	We made a job offer to someone who needs a job accommodation for their social anxiety. I told them they can bring their dog to work. We want to put something in there that says we may agree to the accommodation now but it is subject to change. I want to be more specific but want to know the legality of it.	
8	Our security guard company has one major client and a few small clients, but all guards do essentially the same work. Recently, the "corporate" offices moved to one city, and the "HR" office to another (about 30 miles apart). Now, the "corporate office" is using one set of forms to hire that is different from the forms that have been in use for several years, and are not the same as the forms used for other new hires from the "HR" office. Don't all forms have to be the same? BTW, the forms are vastly different.

It listed a 2010 arrest for Terrorist threat and family violence. Disposition states dropped because the victim withdrew the complaint. We want to rescind the offer. We do customs brokerage work and we work with customs and border control, so we must be careful in who we hire.	
6	If you are in the hiring process and you want to make sure your full time employee has your undivided attention. Can we ask them if they have another job? We have DOT drivers who may only drive a certain amount of hours. We need to know if they will be driving in a second job to ensure they are safely staying within the limits.	
3	We're looking to hire an HR assistant and I was wondering your thoughts on running a criminal and credit check on such a position. It's our first HR position and I feel it's reasonable given she would have access to employee's private information such as SS#'s and payroll information. Where would you recommend an HR person can get additional training if needed in Georgia? Can you recommend a background check provider? She most recently lived in KS.	
6	We have a new hire who has a conviction that occurred 24 years ago. We are not concerned and would not take this into consideration, but we are wondering if we have to disclose this to our client.	
6	I have two kind of long term consultants with sporadic hours. Trying to determine if we should hire them on. And if we do how, to figure out their rate of pay. They are engineers. Would like to talk through some options. We normally employ engineers. We just had a few consultants that worked on a random hours/part-time basis that are on the line as ICs. What is the best way to convert them and pay them? Don't they HAVE to be exempt? Exempt employees cannot be paid hourly, hourly, correct?

5	How long can an employer have a temporary project based employee? Some or most were with temporary agency then converted after one year to a temporary position with the employer	
8	One of our top clients has requested for us to find potential candidates for the positions they currently have available. One of their requirement is that the candidate must be a US citizen or holds a green card since they do not sponsor. Upon screening the candidates I would like to say the following" 1) Would you be willing to take background and drug test 2) Are you familiar with the I-9 process and are you willing to provide us with a copy of your citizenship status (such as a copy of your passport ) or green card. Is it not discriminating to ask the questions in this manner? The reason is that we constantly find ourselves screening and interviewing a lot of employees and later on find out that they need sponsoring. Then we have to disclose that we currently are not sponsoring and go back to square one. What is the best method to approach this situation? Thanks

1	We are interviewing to fill a difficult technical position. After about 8 months of search, we have found a candidate that ticks all of the boxes and who most interviewers are in favor of moving forward with. We had one female interviewer flag that she felt he looked at her unprofessionally (repeatedly at her chest) and mentioned he was single (not sure of the context). We only had one other female interview him who did not have this same experience. Given the difficulty of the search, we are having a hard time determining what the risk/reward is with moving forward despite her concerns, and would love some guidance on how to weigh this feedback.	
6	We work with several temporary agencies and often hire temp to hire. One of these agencies it telling us that we are required to set up with e-verify for the temp-to-hire process. They are stating that this is part of changing with the Trump administration that all employers will be required to do e-verify. What is process for setting up a with e-verify? Have you ever heard that if the temp agency is doing e-verify we would have to do e-verify too?

8	1. Hi! Our VP Talent Solutions is challenging the need to have our candidates complete an employment application. For our online process, you can either click on the LinkedIn link and use your LinkedIn Profile OR post your resume. I would like to respond to her that: 2. EE APP is a legal document, whereas the resume is not. It's more than the compliance release at the bottom. 3. Our online application does not include the following items that do appear on the EE APP. a. Asks if they are US citizen or an alien who has the legal right to remain and work in the US b. List 3 professional references and c. this disclaimer: I understand that if I am hired, my employment may be terminated with or without cause or notice, at any time, at either my option or that of Emerge. I understand that no management representative has any authority to enter into any agreement for continuing employment for any specific period of time or which is contrary to the foregoing and that any such agreement must be in writing signed by Emerge's President. I give Emerge permission to contact all or any of my previous employers and references and authorize them to disclose any information Emerge may request in the course of its investigation of this application for employment, and I hereby release Emerge and such references and prior employers from any and all liability with respect to such disclosures. After a tentative offer of employment has been made, if requested by Emerge, I agree to take a job-related medical examination at no personal expense and authorize the examining physician to disclose the findings to Emerge. I understand that any offer of employment is conditioned upon receipt of satisfactory references and satisfactory completion of any such job-related medical examination. I also understand that I may be requested now or at any subsequent time during my employment with Emerge to submit to drug and/or alcohol tests, at Emerge's expense. I understand that if I refuse to take the test, my employment may be terminated immediately. I have provided truthful and complete responses to all inquiries in the application and authorize Emerge to investigate all statements contained in the application. I understand that the discovery of any falsification or omission constitutes a ground for immediate dismissal or refusal to hire. If employed, I will abide by Emerge's rules and regulations, which I understand are subject to change by Emerge. Date: Applicant's Signature: I do not want to put this disclaimer in an offer letter; we do state that employment is contingent upon satisfactory completion of background, drug screen and reference checks. We also include the standard language that this is not an employment contract. My other question for you is - would attaching a copy of their resume to our employment application be an acceptable compromise? We could modify the EE APP with a check box to indicate "My resume is attached and provides truthful and complete information relative to my work history and education." (or something to that effect). Please advise at your earliest convenience; as you can see, she is eager to drop the EE APP ASAP. Thank you kindly! Karen Karen D'Angelo

0	This is extremely helpful. Thank you!!! I have two follow-up questions for you: 1. You reference we should include last wages and pay rate. I have been discouraging our recruiters from asking this question. Please confirm it is permissible to include in the EE APP but recruiters should refrain from asking it. Any details you can provide are greatly appreciated. 2. Could an on-line application, with all the questions asked as you outline, satisfy as an employment application and carry the same clout as completing a separate EE APP?	
1	We have a new hire that has not presented the appropriate I-9 documentation. She continues to give me excused as to why she cannot produce this such as her SSN card is in a vault, her passport is expired, etc. What are our legal risks and how much time should I give her to provide these?

The manager has reached out to me today to determine offer status and was mainly looking for if the background was complete. It is our understanding the offer was accepted, however the individual has not yet offered her two week resignation to her current employer (due to the contingent piece of the offer). Can you shed some light on how this process works and if what we should communicate back to the manager?	
8	Attn: S Fahl Hello Suzanne, Thank you for reviewing our application packet. I know we should not be asking for a driver's license, though our background service needs DOB and DL number and SSN to run a background. I was thinking we could ask for these 3 things on our release page, and make the release page a separate electronic document. As it is, the release is a separate page, but I didn't know if it needed more separation from the application itself. Please feel free to call me to discuss this live if it would be easier. Thank you in advance for all of your help. Laura Didonna HR Generalist TEC/NEC/CES Phone: (708) 418-7854 [cid:image001.png@01D22ED0.DFB78FB0] [CES]	
8	Please confirm this is an acceptable emails for employee recruitment and communication: "Thank you for your interest in the opening. Please send a letter detailing your timeline for availability to start work and what draws you to our community, this position and the clinic. As part of our process, it would be helpful for you to review our clinic, community and general information about relocation. Our clinic website has a detailed explanation about our business. Housing and relocation to our area is a challenge as we are located in the middle of Ski Country. That is a double edged sword. For those of us who love to ski and enjoy the recreation lifestyle it has many benefits. The alternative is that the cost of living is about 50% higher than the national standard. We have great programs for locals to find housing through resources. Once you have reviewed, please respond within 1 week if you interested in moving to the next round and provide times to speak to our management."

3	I wanted some guidance, we have a set of 40 interns starting this summer ages 15-17. It is part of our policy to do background checks. Do they need to complete background checks since they are minors?	
8	It appears that we have hired people recently and in the past without providing them an offer letter and requesting an acceptance in writing. Ive read that a job offer letter allows you to itemize the facts about the offer, outline the jobs responsibilities and highlight relevant details about the company. In the event that the candidate requests to negotiate issues like salary or vacation, the job offer letter serves as the critical reference point. If the candidate accepts the offer, the letter serves to promote communication and to help orient the new employee to the business environment before they actually start their first day of work. Are there any legal implications if we dont use an offer letter?

8	We have interviewed and were considering a candidate for a position with our company. The candidate completed the job application and checked, "NO" to the question, "Has your license ever been suspended or revoked?". Upon completion of background screening, it was reporting 1993 - 1996 revocations and suspensions of license. As a result, the candidate was not truthful in completing the job application and we are not comfortable with making a job offer. Two q's: 1) Since these incidents occurred over 7 years ago, is the candidate still required to disclose on the job application?; and, 2) what is an acceptable response to the candidate to inform them we will not be extending an offer? thank you!

8	Thank you for this. We currently use the HRIS system Namely where employees, prior to their start date, can complete and electronically sign the I-9. I want to ensure that this is in compliance with federal laws around signing an I-9, since older regulations say that new hires must sign the I-9 in the presence of a company representative, not electronically beforehand. Can you please confirm that this remains in compliance? Thank you!

1	Question from Furlong Vision: We have an employee who just finished her 90 day review, and has been performing well in her role (Billing Coordinator) . The employee would like to transition to an independent contractor , as she has formed an LLC and will eventually be pursuing other clients for billing services. She will draft a services agreement for us to review. Based on her productivity and quality of her work, we are prepared to agree to this transition. However, we are aware that the State of CA and the IRS have very stringent guidelines as to what constitutes an IC vs an employee. Based on what I've read, the burden of proof remains with the employer to meet the criteria to prove that the employee is really an IC. Not meeting this criteria and treating the service provider as an IC (1099 status without withholding taxes, SDI, Med) can result in fines and penalties.

Most of whom is applying or require to have CPT or OPT along with their F1 status to stay comply with Law to work here in the U.S. Our current concern or question is this: does it require for us to pay the Interns, or we can inquire from the School to get their consensus as Unpaid CPT Interns? Also, does CPT impact on unpaid or paid internship decision. Thank you for all your help.	
3	Additional questions regarding asking a candidate for their SSN post offer in order to do background check. Employer's TPA states that they have to have this number. The employee has provided an I-20 form. Can we rescind the job offer if he doesn't provide the SS#?

Do I need to have her compete the typical employment paperwork like a W-9, employee handbook, application, W-2s and such? DO we treat her as a volunteer or like an employee? Thank you!

(1) Such assignment shall become effective upon delivery of written notice to Employer.

We would be hiring them in the Maryland/DC area. They are doing kind of niche work - we have a program set up in grocery stores and they will be physicially setting up program. We will train them and provide them with the materials to set everything up; we have an implementation process they would be trained on. They will have a set schedule for which stores they visit on which days. Can we classify them as 1099 contractors? If not, can we say up front it is temporary position?

8	We've made a job offer to a manager level analyst who has been very difficult to source. He is asking for $10,000 for relocation costs from SF to LA. We are less than 20 person company, but growing and have no precedent for paying relocation costs. I'm wondering what are the best practices when it comes to offering or not offering relocation coverage and what companies generally offer or do depending on the type of position and size of the company. We're considering offering a delayed reimbursement based on 3 months successful employment with favorable review and only offering a $5,000 of reimbursements for verifiable actual costs. Is delayed payment something that ever happens? Is covering a portion of relocation typical? If we do this for this hire, are we setting any kind of premise for future hires and should we write up a policy to protect the company? THANK YOU, Zoe

1	We made an offer to a candidate and she notified us that she currently has scabies which is contagious. Can we pull the offer and tell her to give us a call when she can work?	
2	I asked which forms were required (in my city/state) for new hires. I was sent to a large list of items that are not designated as required or optional. I just want to know what is required.	
1	We offered a job to a worker. We want to convert a temporary employee who works through a temp agency, to a full time employee. We did background check and it came back with a flag on the social security number. It says that it may be false and have been issued under SSA randomization program. Please work with candidate directly to validate authenticity. Question is, do we work under the assumption it's valid and verify her through e-verify or should we speak with her first?	
5	Hello, We have a potential new hire that has this listed on her ss card valid for work only with DHS auth .

4	Question about MVR (motor vehicle record) check upon hiring for driver position. We understand that we can request MVR from a candidate after we made a written conditional offer and the candidates accepted.

Is it acceptable if we ask the candidate to cross out the confidential info such as date of birth or race and submit with employment application? What is the best practice?	
4	We are looking at hiring someone on OPT. I have some questions regarding that. I know from the company's perspective we are not willing to go through the H1-B process and have articulated that. Somebody on a F-1 - can we ask when the OPT expires? If they can't do extensions ... we cannot factor the expiration into employment? Can we ask for the expiration of the visa? What are the requirements for I-9's? Can you confirm the extensions for OPT visas are on hold? What can we ask candidates and people we have offers to?	
6	We are hiring a summer intern in CA. It is a paid internship I wanted to know if there was an hour limit per week that he/she could not work past for example, can they work 40 hours a week?

1	We have an employee that presented questionable documents to complete Form I-9, in fact in completing Section 1, the name and date of birth did not match what was supplied. As such, we processed termination. The former employee has recently come back with new identification that has the name she previously offered to us, and a resident alien card that appears different. Do we have to rehire her?

8	Does an employee have the right to continue working when a pre-adverse action notice is sent to him/her?

5	Offer letter contingent on Employment Authorization Documment	
4	For the I-9 new hires can pick any document they want. I know that if part of their job is to drive we can ask them to show us their drivers license. We are having some difficulties where the social security number is not matching the name. Can we ask to see the social to make sure we are putting the name in correctly?	
5	Can an employer charge an applicant for a pre-employment drug test? Illinois and Indiana to start. For example, CA specifically says medical exam and drug screen. I can't seem to find for Illinois or Indiana where is says drug screen specifically.	
8	If we are hiring a former employee who completed their I9 in 2013 and the form is outdated, does the I9 need to be done again or can the rehire section be completed?	
6	Hello. We are interested in hiring a former employee who has admitted to having drug issues in the past - addicted to pain medication following surgery.

6	We set up and take down exhibits at Trade Shows. We are in need of part-time seasonal EE's. The job is not for everyone. Many potential EE's think it looks fun when they get a tour of our facility and we let them see guys working and then they work one show and decide it's not for them. We would like for them to be able to "try it before they buy it" by offering to let them work one show (generally 2-10 hours). If they like it, then we would go through the lengthy process of putting them on payroll. And for the one show - we would pay them for hours worked (not through payroll but just cut them a check with no deductions - I guess this would be more like an independent contractor). Is this legal? If not, is there anything that IS legal that we can do to let them see if they like the work before we put them on payroll.	
5	Do I legally have to post a job online? Or if I already know I have an applicant can I just hire them?

8	I recently joined a company and shortly before I joined the Accounting Manager was covering HR. They had an audit done and at the time they had an I-9 book. However, since I joined they have not been able to locate it. They said it is in the building but they are not sure where. Since I started, I have had everyone do an I-9. Now I have co-ops who are converting to regular employees. What I may do is say everyone has to sign a handbook and update your I-9s. I'm going to have to recreate - should I just put in a memo that says I recreated them because they were misplaced.	
1	We have just started a summer-long paid internship for an individual. Her offer letter clearly states she cannot exceed 29 hours/week, but we are now getting push back on that. Managers want her to work up to 40. As an intern, would we have to offer her benefits or anything? Our main concern with working over 30/week is that she is then considered FT.

3	A candidate would like a copy of their background check. What is the proper procedure for providing that?	
1	We recently hired an employee that started this week. She was told after she was hired that she needed to be proficient in typing and provided specific accuracy she needed. This was not addressed during the interview process or listed as an essential duty of the job. We are willing to pay for the typing course but I disagree that they should make continued employment contingent on her ability to type. What are your thoughts. This was not a requirement of the job prior when an older man was in the role and again, not listed on the job description.	
8	We have 12 different divisions, all over the State. All new hires are done through us at corporate. We have some papers filled out on site.

4	We are a staffing firm and one of our clients has asked us to ask candidates when they graduated - prior to the first interview. This seems inappropriate to me. Can you advise?	
6	We are trying to impliment a new program for our new sales people. We have been hiring them on in a sales role, and then sending them to sales training before they are returned to their sales areas. We have determined that individuals who come into the sales role with a working knowledge of the operations tend to do better in their sales role. We are considering requiring new hires to spend a month or so in operations, and then send them to sales training before allowing them to begin in their sales role. When it comes to the offer letter for these individuals, how would we construct that?	
6	We are a smaller employer with a team of 4 core employees. We do hire several contractors. Are there any laws we need to consider in hiring more contractors than employees?	
3	HI! We conduct background check and drug screens for all our candidates. I understand that per Article 23-A we are required to send a letter to the candidate if we decide to withdraw our offer based on the findings in the background check/ drug screen.

4	With the Ban the Box legislation in MA, I'm curious if our question on our application meets the requirement of the regulation. These applicants are being considered for positions for which a CDL will be required, so I'm wondering if the DOT requirements allow us to ask about convictions? Have you ever been convicted of a crime? If yes, please explain: _____________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________________ (Please note that a criminal conviction will not necessarily prevent employment.

6	We staff disably challenged individuals in jobs within our community. One of our employees applied for a job as a clothing associate at an outdoor retail store. They asked if he is able to acquire a firearm. A firearm would not be required to sell clothing, so we are wondering if they are trying to exclude him from hiring due to his disability. How should we manage?

6	We are a furniture installation company and all of our crew have a job description that requires them to be fit. Able to pickup certain weight etc. We would like to perform health assessment - at a local facility - that will let us know if they can do the work.

7	An individual's background check shows a charge of fraud as pending. We understand that we cannot take negative action at this time. But what if the pending charge leads to a conviction, and we have him eventually working in a position where he has access to cash, credit card and other financial transactions?

8	I have 2 Managers that were recently re-hired, one Hourly the other Salaried. Upon return the Salaried Manager (gone 12 years) was offered reinstatement of PTO as grandfathered starting at 6 years which equals 18 days a year. The Hourly Manager (gone 9 years) was not offered the same upon their rehire (Jan. 2014) and had to start at the beginning with 12 days per year. The Hourly Manager has been here 3 years before this Salaried Manger was recently rehired. Now the Hourly Manager is stating we are discriminating. I am not sure if we are or not because one is Hourly the other Salaried but both in Management positions. All other benefits for both are equal except this PTO Benefit. Should I be concerned?	
4	We currently have this question on our online application: "Have you ever been convicted of a crime, excluding misdemeanors and summary offenses, which has not been annulled, expunged or sealed by court? (A yes response does not automatically disqualify your application)". Is the acceptable to keep or does the "ban the box" legislation require us to remove it completely?	
3	What does an Investigative Consumer Report include? I perform a background check from CBI and check references from previous employers but are there other reports that I am able to perform on potential candidates employment pre-screenings? .i.e character, general reputation, personal characteristics, credit records and or mode of living? We use an online application which includes a disclaimer with these examples.

6	I'm taking over a hotel and they have 4 employees. We know we are under no obligation to retain those 4 employees. They 2 housekeepers and 2 front desk employees. We will be letting the housekeepers apply, and we will consider hiring them. Would it be considered discriminatory to not give the 2 front desk employees the opportunity to apply because my husband and I will run the front desk for two months. If after the two months we do hire people for the front desk position, but don't hire the employees from the other company would that be discriminatory?	
6	Paid internships and classifications and the documents we need to provide them: A manager was thinking of having them sign an independent contractor agreement? They have to comply with company policies? Can we classify them as a temporary employee? Would they be entitled to benefits?	
7	Hello, We extended an offer (there was no time limit for the candidate to return a response). We now want to withdraw the offer because the candidate stated that we are not his first choice but hopes to get back to us in another week (its been 2 weeks since we extended the offer). He has not formally declined our offer but we want to withdraw it. What employer obligations do we have to withdraw the offer? Thanks.

Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Washington, California	
8	Maybe 6-8 months ago we started to do informal background checks on employees. Part of the process is that we send the link to fill out the application through the well known/trusted provider through the provider's portal. We do not see their information.

6	Are there laws around posting positions. I understand we have the discretion to post the position as long as we want, but what about if we have to post it. For example, say we want to move an internal candidate to the position. Do we have to have posted it and allowed everyone who wanted to to apply and interview? Or can we just make the change? Or say we only want to post for external candidates? Is that fine? We are not a federal contractor.

6	We are having some issues with employees social security numbers being incorrect and their full legal names. What can we legally ask for? I understand it may differentiate if the employee is a new hire or current employee. What about EVerify? I know some states are required but can we have all locations in various states conduct EVerify? We are incurring fees and administrative issues when this information is incorrect.	
8	U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services provided a worksheet, "Retaining Form I-9," which calculates how long an employee's Form I-9 is to be retained in our file. It's our understanding that this is the minimum time. Is there also a maximum? In other words, are we required to purge these forms from an employee's file after the expiration of the minimum time? Because we are a seasonal employer with employees hired from many different locations where we perform work, we retain employee files for more than three years after an employee is terminated. This makes it easier to complete new employment-related forms if we bring an employee back after 4 or 5 years of inactivity.

In such case, a new Form I-9 is not required, Section 3 of the original Form I-9 need not be completed, but the employer must ensure that reverification, if necessary, was timely completed. However, for employees who have not been continuously employed and/or did not have a reasonable expectation of employment at all times, a hire is considered to have taken place when the employees return to work. If this occurs within 3 years from the initial date of execution of Form I-9, the procedures for rehires may be followed. If this occurs after 3 years from the initial date of execution, a new Form I-9 must be completed.

4	On our applications we ask the question "Have you ever been convicted of, plead guilty to, or pled no contest to a crime, excluding misdemeanors and traffic violation?

6	I have a question regarding temporary classification - what would you say is too long to classify a postion as temporary? Normally our temporary employees do not recieve benefits, but because we are non-profit sometimes we have created a postion that is short-term due to contract agreements.

8	Thank you for your response re: my application question in Massachusetts. Would this updated version of the question be appropriate for MAs ban the box regulations? "Please list any convictions in the past 5 years, excluding a first conviction for the misdemeanors of drunkenness, simple assault, speeding, minor traffic violations, affray, or disturbance of the peace." Also, because we hire CDL drivers, are we still able to ask for traffic infractions (speeding, minor traffic violations) on our driver applications?

1	I have a circumstance where an employee has been with the company for seven years and has been largely in a finance role. At the start she was one of the very first employees (we are a small company) and was a jack of all trades. As we grew, she has remained in the finance department but doing more operational work; a utility player and problem solver. We are advancing her in her career and placing her in a niche operations role. It is a new role for the company. We are making the official change today; she will have a new title but it's a lateral responsibility move from Finance to Operations with a new reporting structure. Are we required to post the role?

Attachment at the bottom. ---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: Michael Courtney > Date: Tue, Feb 28, 2017 at 4:21 PM Subject: To: Eli Gelfand > SENIOR EXPLORATION Class of 2017 Q: What is Senior Exploration? A: This is a program offered to seniors that will modify the senior year curriculum and provide an opportunity for students to apply knowledge and skills they have acquired in school to an area of genuine interest. Senior Exploration emphasizes real-world experience, enabling students to participate in an enrichment experience beyond the traditional academic offerings of the classroom. Students, teachers, administrators, and staff members at the school together will work together with parents and members of the community as part of the Senior Exploration program. Under the guidance of mentor-teachers, students design individualized projects based on an identified and approved interest. Students may work or apprentice in a particular industry, involve themselves in community service, or explore a creative project. Q: Who participates in Senior Exploration? A: All seniors will participate in the program as a graduation requirement. They will receive credit and are not allowed to get paid a stipend. Q: Since I have so many classes in addition to college and Israel planning to deal with, when will I ever have time to work on something extra? A: With Senior Exploration, seniors will complete the first semester as usual. During second semester, students will complete their academic requirements for the school year and then Senior Exploration projects will begin in April (with modifications for AP students) and continue with presentations until the end of May. All seniors will be given hours to work on their projects beginning with April 20th and concluding with May 19th. Planning for the Senior Exploration begins towards the middle of the first semester of the senior year. Q: Is Senior Exploration an internship program? A: No. Although many students may have an internship as part of their project, for Senior Exploration students actually work on a broader project as it is a serious, intense academic program as much about personal growth and reflection as to the topic that you choose. Q: Do I have to work on my own or can I work in a group? A: Yes, students are required to work independently unless given special approval to work with one partner. Every individual, however, must submit individual work and give ones own presentation. Q: How will Senior Exploration help me after this year? A: Ideally, Senior Exploration projects will combine independent study with practical application. Senior Exploration reinforces the skills of setting and working toward personal and project goals as well as providing an opportunity to apply school-learned skills in the real-world to help you to transition to Israel, college, work, and the rest of your life. The project will also involve a cultural tie to the Grand Conversation, as seniors will add a research component that draws upon their knowledge of Judaism. Q: How will we know about information, developments, and deadlines throughout the year? Information about Senior Exploration will be provided most often through your mentor or advisor during Advisory meetings, as well as grade-wide meetings with the Senior Exploration Steering Committee. During the four and a half weeks of Senior Exploration, there will be special Senior Exploration advisories gathering once a week. Q: What things will I have to do during the year to complete the Senior Exploration requirements? A: In December, you will fill out a mentor preference form and be paired with an SAR teacher. You will schedule your first meeting with the mentor and then submit an initial proposal for your project. In late March, you will submit the research component and Essential Question as part of the first journal submission. In April and May, you will have four and a half weeks to devote to your project and journal your experience, with the scheduling affording you the time to devote 50 hours to Senior Exploration (and 40 hours for students in 3 AP courses). You will finally share your project via your final presentation in late May. Q: What does the Judaic component entail? A: Every senior will present a meticulously researched Grand Conversation component encompassing a minimum of two sources. Students will be given source sheets to research their topics and they will have the opportunity to learn individually with Judaic Studies faculty and/or fellows. Q: How is Senior Exploration graded? A: At the end of the year, students will be given an A+, A, B, C, or D. Anyone given an F at the end of the program still must perform the necessary steps once again in order to ultimately pass and receive a high school diploma. Students will be graded out of 100 points: Product (45), Presentation (30), and Journals (25). Q: Whom can I go to for further information? A: You can go to any member of the Senior Exploration Steering Committee (Mr. Courtney, Ms. Schneider, Dr. Schwartz, Ms. Germano, Russi Bohm, Ms. Cohen, Ms. Birnbaum, Rabbi Drelich, and Ms. Gryzlo), your mentor, or your advisor. -- Michael A.

7	We are a professional fundraiser for political organizations. We have to register with all of the states we do business in. We have to register with the Attorney General. We have to say we dont employ anyone with a history of financial crime, since they have access to credit cards and private information. Our Illinois location, does not have a statues for when criminal history could occur. They dont care how far back a conviction might have been, theyre not allowed to be a professional fundraiser. We had a complaint filed with the Attorney General in Illinois, for our hiring practices. The complainant said the manager we hired has a criminal history and its not allowed to work in this field. That manager was hired 3-4 years ago and he had a paper application form. He left the criminal questions blank, even though he is already employed. Can we go back and give him complete this application now? He has passed a background check with us, which goes back 7 years. He is already employed and now we want to run a full background check that goes back indefinitely. The fundraising we do, its on behalf of our clients, the HR department of Chicago Symphony. They are requesting a copy of the new background check. We arent sure if we can share that information with them.	
3	We would appreciate your input on Back Ground checks. To include if you have this, a step by step process to implement as well as do's and do not's. We have a full service restaurant group and wish to begin background checks on manager candidates and certainly do not wish to jump into a lawsuit with someone. To what depth do companies in the restaurant business check? Like criminal background, credit , job references for example. Also,Can we go back and do a background check on existing managers.

6	Hello. We are hoping you can assist us. Our company does not provide sponsorship for non US citizens who require company sponsorship or would need a company to be able to transfer their visa to. We have a question in our pre-employment application if they require sponsorship now or in the future. If they do, we would need to reject them. We have been coding them as not qualified when we send them their rejection email, but the reason we are rejecting them is because we are not able to sponsor them. We are wondering if we are able to add a rejection reason due to company sponsorship, and if so, wondering what exactly we would call it, and if it is a good idea to have that be the reason since they may be qualified, but due to sponsorship we are rejecting them. Please guide us in choosing to either code them as not qualified or if we can add another rejection code due to the company not being able to sponsor them and if so, what would we call/label that rejection reason/email

For some positions, there is a need for the employee to be fluent in another language, usually Spanish or Korean. We recently posted a position for a Medical Assistant who is fluent in Korean as well. A candidate responded that it was "illegal to discriminate" on the basis of language and that she will report us to the EEOC. We are not worried about an EEOC audit since we are not doing anything illegal but were wondering about the best language and wording to use in the job posting from now on or are some of these claims inevitable when we recruit for proficiency in more than one language?	
8	We are hiring a new employee in NY state. We know we need to provide the pay day and pay rate information, as part of the wage theft notification.

Would that create a change in their SS number? Finally, are there any other new hire forms in NY I need to be aware of?

1	It's regarding advice on a background check that I think we will need to adverse. Basically, it looks like she has falsified her application. Have you ever been convicted of a offense (federal or misdemeanor). A misdemeanor came up and it was a little more than 7 years ago but the disposition date was less than 7 years ago. She also said she didn't it was on her record and she talked about going to court and ding community service. The offense date was in 2009. 2010 conviction and violated parole in 2012. The job she is going to is a UR coordinator and handling patient money. She was arrested and convicted for embezzlement. Her response to us was a lot of excuses. "I made the wrong friend."	
8	When calling an candidates references the person who is the reference is transgender and she has her old outgoing message on voicemiail. It still has her old 'male" name. I've clarified with the candidate that I'm calling the correct number and he explained the situation. I did not want to tell the employer what was going on because I did not want to break any law by divulging that someone was going through through the transgender process. We simply told the employer that the number was correct. What are the laws around a person being transgendered?	
3	Can an employer in CA pull a background check on applicants to see if they have filed WC claims in the past?	
5	We have an employee that filled out his New Hire paperwork with the name that matches his Social Security Card, His drivers license has a different last name. Is the drivers license still an appropriate item to use as verification on the I9 or do we have to request a different item?

4	Is the following question safe to put on applications in the State of Tennessee: "Have you ever plead guilty or no contest or been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor"	
8	How do we stay in compliance and avoid any claim of discrimination with a new hire who as taken a pre-employment functional job assessment and has not passed. They are not able to physically perform functions of the job, and did not mention they would need any accommodations when asked in interview.

Is there anything we need to do to ensure these hires are categorized as temporary, so as not to affect our unemployment rating? Thank you! Linda Morich	
2	We are hiring an employee in Seattle, Washington - what are the new hire forms?	
6	In terms of our post offer candidate screening, can we ask questions at that time regarding criminal background screen and driver's record? We have assumed candidates would weed themselves out of the process when we have stated these post offer inquiries would be required, however, this does not seem to happen.	
5	HI, I have a question on an I9 form of identification presented to us from Arizona. I have an AZ identification card and it states on it not for federal identification. Is this an acceptable document for the I9 form. If it did not say not for federal identification I would accept.	
6	Can we hire a part time temporary position to fill in while we try to recruit for a regular part time employee?	
6	There is a possibility that we may have people who want to intern or volunteer to work for us over the summer. We aren't sure where that leaves us liability wise.	
8	For a hire date when we determine official 'hire date' would that be the very day of training or the first day they go on the job?	
3	We extended an offer to a new hire and his background check came back with a misdemeanor that was settled in April 2017. Should I even bring this up to him?	
8	Someone told me they went on an interview and their first interview was with the staff. The second step was with the manager. Then the final step with the leadership. We want to talk about this as a practice and what risks might exist.	
6	Hiring a minor, what are our options - we typically do not hire minors and a verbal offer has been extended.	
8	What are the risks of contingent employment offers?	
1	I have an employee who applied for a promotion to a management position. I am wondering our liability - in her letter of interest "as far as my history and mood swings, I have been in counseling...on proper medicine." Historically, she has been wishy-washy. She does meet the qualifications. We have other candidates.	
6	Altius Space Machines is planning on hiring a U.S. citizen who is currently working in Nicaragua and would continue to work from Nicaragua for the next eight months or so then move back to the U.S. to work at our Broomfield, CO location. I've been doing some research and I believe we can hire this person as a W2 employee withholding federal, UI and state taxes. Do you know if there are other actions we need to take? Do you need to register our business with Nicaragua or pay local taxes? Any other risks of which we should be aware?	
2	If we change our new hire paperwork, should we enter the new revised date on the form?	
7	EE is going to be rehired. He worked for us for many years and left about 10 years ago. I do not have any files on his since they have been purged. I have heard he had a verbal altercation with a co worker. A current supervisor brought this issue to my attention but was not directly involved in the situation, the supervisor just knows of the incident. This supervisor would like me to add language in the offer letter that states any verbal altercations will not be tolerated and will lead to immediate termination. I am uncomfortable since we do not have any record of this and it's already covered in our employee handbook.	
2	Can you provide general guidance on new hire onboarding?	
3	I have a small business client that wants to start getting background checks and credit checks on management candidates. Is this allowed? Can it be done just for 1 class of employee?

8	A recruiter put out an ad for us for a specified position. The ad had old information it about a possible sign on bonus that we are actually not offering. The employee hired was interviewed and there was no discussion of a sign on bonus, nor did the employee's offer letter refer to such a bonus. The employee is now asking us about this. Are we obligated to pay this bonus based on the misinformation on the original job posting?	
8	Hello, An unusual question was posed to us today. Are there any state laws that would permit an employer to not hire someone because they are a smoker? Specifically, Washington State? I would this would violate the ADA. I am aware of smoker protection laws, but this is just the opposite.	
5	Does the 'Job Description Builder' already have the required ADA/FMLA/FLSA lingo?	
6	We are interviewing three candidates for an executive assistant role. One candidate is through an agency. We want to do temp to hire. If we pick the agency candidate, they would put together the temp to hire offer letter. But, if we pick one of the non-agency candidates, we don't have an offer letter template for this situation. I want to run by our thoughts on what to put in that letter.	
8	To Whom It May Concern. I work for a staffing agency. We do not discriminate in our taking of I-9 documents but have the applicant give us the documents for Sections 1 and 2 that appear on the List of Acceptable Documents as they choose. However, I have a client that is asking we send to them only temporary employees that used a Passport or a Birth Certificate for security reasons. I am uncomfortable with this request. What is your advise?	
6	If we have an offer letter and we are not sure of a start date, what should we put on the offer letter?	
2	For a New Hire in the State of PA, what are all required State documents that should be signed upon hire.	
3	We want to do a background check. Is there a good company we can use?	
7	I have a possible new hire - I extended a job offer. So far he has passed the physical and drug test. During our reference check, his professional and personal references were not very good. We work with individuals with special needs. I would not want to leave him alone with individuals. He did not indicate he worked at another place and in a check, there was a violation at a place he said he did not work at. He also did not disclose a misdemeanor for reckless driving. The misdemeanor still passes. But, he didn't disclose. Same, with the recipient rights. He said he did not work there.	
1	We have a question about a staff who is changing status. She was previously an employee and now she is coming on for about 4 weeks to help us onboard and create a training manual. The last day as a full time employee was this past Friday and now we want bring her on as a consultant. Would this cause any red flags? She does not have her own business, she would still perform the work at our site, using our equipment, etc.	
1	It's regarding best practices. we haired a director level staff. Theyhave not started yet. they had asked to look at current training for other staff to familiarize themselves. Because she hasn't signed anything yet, is it better to wait until she starts so we have her sing confidentiality agreements? and is it considered work and would we have to compensate for that?	
6	If we made an unwritten job offer to someone, they were supposed to go take their drug test, but they have been sick and on bed rest for a week. They provided a doctors note. Can we remove our offer of employment?	
6	Who are W-9's given to? Are they only issues within the U.S.?	
8	Do you have any resources or checklists for employers to query new hires about their status. The issue is with employees with Student visas, since medicare & SS should not be withheld for these individuals and they are not always aware, it gets with held and becomes an issue later. The W4 does not cover these situations. What is best practice?	
5	Youth employment. Can we exclude 16 years old from employment?	
0	We are working on a online on-boarding and I am working on a template letter to notify them that the next step is a drug screen/physical and provide them with directions scheduling their appointment. Do you have any such template?

We have a report for criminal background 2008 felony conviction disposition is 2011. When we are looking at those type of things. Does Illinois have any limitation as far back? Do companies usually use the disposition date.	
6	We want to do an internal audit of our I-9s. We have noticed a couple of our employees dated the I-9 with their birth date - how do we correct it?	
8	We currently have an online benefits administration and HR platform that gathers I-9 information and includes the attestation "I am aware that federal law provides for imprisonment and/or fines for false statements or use of false documents in connection with the completion of this form." This platform also includes an electronic signature and consent agreement. Does having a) the document details, b) the attestation, and c) copies of the documents stored locally (just not all on the I-9 form) meet USCIS requirements?	
7	A new employee started on Monday. He brought in one document only and said he would bring it during lunch, he did not. The next day he resigned so the I-9 verification process was never completed. Will we be out of compliance because if this?	
7	Recruiting colleague was pre-screening candidate currently employed on WC leave has not been evaluated by the WC doctor. Can the employer required a clearance from the WC injury? Recruiter asked the candidate if he needed accommodation and he said he did not.	
5	We would like to offer a role to an employee who has an L2 Visa that expires in July 2017, as well as an Employment Authorization Card (EAC) that expires in July 2018.

4	We have a question about the interviewing process and if (after the initial application process) during the interview we can then ask about whether the person has had a conviction. We cannot ask about arrests, correct?	
8	We are a staffing agency. The client asked us to run a credit check on an employee. We got the employee to sign off. Now the client wants to see the credit report. Are we at liberty to disclose the report to the client?

6	Hello! A workers compensation question from a client: We are preparing to hire employees who will be working remotely from other states. Their permanent location will be in those states. I have researched with Ohio BWC and the ODJFS Office of Unemployment the process in which we go through to get registered for both. Can you email and ask: 1. How do we and what requirements do we have to follow to register/enroll/pay for both BWC and Unemployment Tax for other states? 2. What else should we be considering regarding remote employees? Thank you!	
7	We have a manager that is wanting to rehire a former employee. When here in 2013 the employee had drinking problems that caused extreme attendance issues. He was terminated for attendance in 2013. Since then he has attempted to come back on a yearly basis, but each year his background report gets worse. In his absence from the company he has been in rehab for drinking problems on at least two occasions that he has admitted to. One week out of rehab and he wants to come back again. The manager is so short on employees that they want to give him another shot in spite of the issues. But first he is concerned about company liability and potential for our financial liability for treatment, etc.? Would there be an occasion where the company could possibly be held responsible for treatment costs?	
6	We are considering having children from a local high school intern at our organization. What laws to we need to consider in this situation? Even though this is not paid labor, we expect that we should review/follow/consider the FLSA child labor laws.

6	RE: Ban the Box in Los Angeles (we do business in LA). Understand the law BUT because we are a security company we require employees to carry an ACE (Alarm Company Emplolyee) lic. and there are situations where the BSIS will deny a lic based on background checks.

6	We're in the floral industry and sometimes we need to hire workers based on busy seasons or for large corporation orders. Is there a minimum amount of time we need to schedule an employee?	
2	Can you ask new hires to complete onboarding paperwork before their first day?	
6	As an e-verify participant, do we need to enter previous employees, if they are not currently employed?	
7	We have a situation with a possible new hire that we had come across. We had an applicant apply and interview, after the interview we said he will be hired pending background check. We ran a check and found that he has a history of misdemeanors with disorderly conducts. He did disclose one of the crimes but not the others. Do we still have grounds to deny employment after running a background check even though he disclosed this on his record. Also to mention that we are in the health industry as a long term care facility and he had nothing on his caregiver background check. We just don't feel safe having this person around our residents as an employee. Any guidance will help. Thank you.	
8	I want to talk about recruiting and expanding our candidate pool. There is one position that were having a difficult time filing. It is for a registered nurse position. We are in a smaller rural area, the pay is lower, but the demands are much different than the registered nurses to work at the local hospital or clinics. The workload here is different, slower pace, focused on prevention and education, not the fast past of the emergency room or treating patients. We would like to talk about how to attract qualified candidates.	
1	An employee began working for us in November and presented us with her DL and SS card. We ran E-Verify and everything came out fine. She discontinued working for us in Jan, but has just come back and she came to us with a brand new DL and a different SS card with a different name and number. She told us that the documents she presented in November were fake. How should we manage?

5	I plan on hiring a new employee who is on a resident card but the card has expired. Can I request something from list B or C to support the resident card? Can I use the resident card but what would I use for the expiration date? The online form doesn't accept an expired date.

1	Hi- we have a former employee (left the org in January 2017) that we're considering hiring as a consultant for a specific project. Her work fits into right classification for an independent contractor, but we want to know if the fact that she was a regular employee would raise flags about her taking on this new classification? Thanks	
8	I have a candidate we're considering for hire. The individual notified us of a past wrist injury. In Texas, we issue form DWC -156 which goes to through the state's Division of WC. It then notifies us if the employee has ever had a WC claim. We have candidates complete the form but we've never submitted it to the state. The hiring manager has requested that we submit it for this candidate. What are your thoughts?	
2	Does the state of New Mexico have a WC form similar to Texas' DWC-156 for job candidates?	
8	We have a nepotism policy that prohibits brothers from working in the same department. Can the fact that they're seasonal employees in the Highway Dept. help us view this differently?	
3	During an interview, a candidate revealed issues that would show up on his background check that would keep him from passing our background check. The candidate has called to follow up with us on a position. How do we communicate to this candidate? When this happens, what do we communicate to the candidate when they call back to ask if they got the job? What can we say / not say? What should we say / not say?

2	Hi, I'm building out new information for the school year . I'm looking right now at new hire paperwork and our personnel handbook. I'm wondering if there are school / education specific items. For example, confidentiality agreement - which includes school records, or student data. Additionally, are there state required new hire pamphlets that I must include, and if so - is there a list somewhere for that. I was unable to find it. Thanks!	
7	After an employee is hired they sign an authorization to do a background screen. For whatever reason who ever hired chose to ignore the fact that he is a registered sex offender. Would that have been a reason to not hire?	
6	We realized that there may have been some employees who did not receive the pre-designation notice when they were onboarded. Should we go back and provide the notice now? We had a situation in which one employee did not predesignate but saw his doctor and workers comp said they still needed to see a doctor in our MPN.	
6	We are thinking of hiring paid interns. We want to bring one in from Germany and one from the US. Are there special rules for interns?	
4	Are there certain questions that we are not allowed to ask on our employment application (like felony convictions, previous pay rates, military service discharge, etc.)?	
6	We found the website youth.gov regarding rules and regulations for 16-17 year old workers. Obviously this is a trusted government site but we'd like to make sure that for our business type we hire correctly. We always have employees who want their 16-17 year kids to come work for us for the summer but it seems they aren't allowed to do much of any work in construction. Just looking to verify the website's claims and get any other information on this topic.

8	We hired an employee in 2014 who worked for us for three months under a different name.

6	We are in the process of hiring a new Medical Director for our treatment center. He will be on site at our locations from time to time. We think we should classify him as an independent contractor? If so, what are the required components of his personnel file? I've been advised in the past to refer to such a person as a "vendor" instead of "independent contractor." We used to call these types "consultants." Can you advise?? thanks!	
3	Calling to discuss confidentiality of background checks when it comes to the HR and recruiting teams for our company. Phone: (205) 310-2228 We are mainly concerned that now that we move the background checks to the offer stage, recruiters will know that if a candidate is turned down, that it was due to the background.	
6	We had a job posting and placed a deadline on accepting resumes. We then received a few more resumes after that date, and one of them is a highly desired candidate for the position. Must we consider each resume that came in after the deadline, or can we go straight to his resume only?	
7	A candidate requested that we contact a parole officer (or case worker) to get approval for him to attend a job interview with us. Are we required to do that for a candidate? So far he has completed a job application and a screening test but we have not interviewed him yet.	
6	What are the requirements to hiring interns? Currently, we've given them stipends and treat them as 1099 contractors they are only working 30-35 hours a week.	
2	Can you provide benchmarking for a new position we are looking to hire for?	
6	We are looking to hire someone who is in school who can start as soon as they are out of school. They're trying to figure the best way to get a commitment so we are not stung in the end, such as a signing bonus. Or can it be an advanced and applied against their first check (California)? Let's say we offer $60k and check in each month and with each check in, add another thousand to the salary?	
5	I am interviewing a potential employee next week who gave me a copy of his drivers license and a copy of his social security card with his completed application. His social security card says "Valid for work only with DHS Authorization" I'm not sure exactly what this indicates, what additional paperwork I might need, who I would contact for authorization and what information they would need.	
6	I am thinking of recruiting and targeting some specific populations, particularly retirees and college students. Do you know of good resources (other than things like Indeed or Craigslist) where I might be able to target these types of people en masse? We also are interested in whether there might be a good resource for moms who only want to return to the workforce part time.	
5	what is the difference between independent contractors and other contractors?

3	Background Investigations: We do background checks on everyone we hire and they are more in depth for people at our head start program. Can we ask employees to fill out the approval form during the interview but before an offer is made? We would like to run the background check before an offer is made as well to avoid having issues where people start, their background comes back problematically and we have to terminate. We only employ people in the state of Wisconsin.	
5	Our client, who has a limited HR team/expertise, is asking about I-9 reverification. Please advise on requirements of I-9 reverification.	
2	A new hire admitted to using marijuana recreationally in her personal time. The drug screening came back clear. Given this admission, is there a protocol that we should follow?	
7	We offered employment to an individual that now refuses to provide us with a copy of social security card/number. We are a government contractor and are required to verify thru e-verify. He did provide a copy of valid driver's license and says he can provide a birth certificate. That should take care of the I9 verification. However, if he refuses to provide SS# (quoting theological reasons) how do we proceed with employment in reference to taxes, etc?	
2	We will be hiring several employees who do not speak English well. Any services to help us with Spanish-speaking new hire orientations?	
5	We are making an offer to an employee and are looking for sample sign on bonus offer.	
7	1. a new hire who lives and works in SF had his background check come back with convictions of DUI, possession and assaulting a police officer. He will be working as a tutor online for children. May we rescind our job offer based on these charges? May we conduct a background check prior to extending a job offer? 2. Another employee has had ongoing performance issues that are unresolved.

8	On our job descriptions, we have listed some physical requirements and marked the % of time you might be required to do the task, such as sitting, walking, standing, etc. My question is - at the end of list, we ask this statement "are there any other physical or mental requirements of this position not addressed above"? Do we need to keep this statement? Thank you	
1	We have a candidate whose background came back with information regarding her writing bad checks. She will be working in our billing department and we would like to rescind the offer. Can we call her and tell her that based on the background information, we cannot offer her the job?	
8	We have a few positions that require the ability to read the markings on the top of a manufactured part. Occasionally we hire someone who can't see well enough to distinguish a good part from a bad part, even with the assistance of glasses. Can we institute a vision test as part of the pre employment screening process. Perhaps using the actual work piece as a test to determine if an applicant can see well enough to perform an essential element of the job?	
4	Is it illegal to ask for a social security number in the application form?	
8	Interested in answer for a client looking at contract jobs. They are a TN non-profit employer and have drafted an agreement for a FLSA exempt position but outlined the terms of the agreement for one year, then evergreen if the terms are still in place. There is some concern grant funding will disappear after one year. If at the end of the term it is not renewed is the employee eligible for unemployment? Thank you	
6	We do pre-employment drug screen (post-accident, reasonable suspicion), we have a current temp to hire employee. If the temp had been tested positive for drugs, then they would not be hired. They were initially drug screened as a temp, and at that point he passed. Our process is that we retest when we hire as our own employee. His test came back positive and invalid.

8	We have J1 students from Jamaica working for us this summer. The students have requested that our company pays for their housing/rent up front and deduct it from their paychecks. Would this be legal if they sign an authorization giving us permission to make the deductions for housing?

5	Is there a checklist to determine the difference between and employee and independent contractor?	
2	New Hire Forms: I have been reviewing our new hire checklist for audit purposes and ensuring there aren't major changes to required notices upon hire. It appears to me that there are four different pamphlets that are given out in California. My understanding is that I have to give out brochures at hire relating to unemployment insurance (DE-2320), state disability insurance (DE-2515) and PFL (DE-2511). However, there is also a form DE 1857 which seems to summarize all three. Can I just give out the DE 1857 or do I really need to provide the individual brochures? Additionally, what exactly is required to be provided related to workers compensation for new hires. I was reading online (I think on the EDD site) that we are required to provide the New Employee's Guide to Workers Compensation Insurance and it says we should get it from the carrier (I know Cal Chamber sells a generic version as well). However, I think we are also required to provide the time of hire booklet (DWC Form 9783.1). Do we really have to provide both of these items? Additionally, if the first item is truly required is there a generic version available from the state instead of getting it from our carrier?

4	I was going through our employee application and we are looking to put or application in a system where we send it to them ahead of time. We are a temp agency and currently we have them come in for their interview and then fill out the application. On the application, it asks whether or not they have been convicted of a felony before. We have ban the box in Rhode Island. If we were to send out the applications ahead of time, would it still be legal to have that on the application?	
7	We have a transportation department. We do pre employment drug testing. We had our first applicant test ever test positive for marijuana. What is my legal responsibly? Is he allowed to contest it? can he re take it? I would like some guidance on what to tell the applicant.

2	I would like your opinion on entering new hires before their start date. We are being directed to get the new employee set up in the system but do not think they should be asked to come in to fill out paperwork before they start. In order to set them up in the system we need their DOB and SSN, which we typically get off the I-9 form.	
8	Separate from the Form I-9, we request a copy of the drivers license since they may drive for us.

Should we amend our EEO statement to be more inclusive based on Philadelphia's fair employment laws? As part of our process we use selection.com to do a criminal check. I know before hand I cannot ask about that. The application explains background screens. Do I have to have this information on the application?

One of these men was really bothered by the comment and assured her that he had been a fan of other women candidates. Do you think this is serious enough to investigate? If so, should I start by meeting with the senior woman leader? Thanks!

The person has a criminal history with misdemeanors over 4 years (2011-2015), 3 different interactions. This is an administrative job that is entry level for us. The applicant has also been asked to take a pre-employment drug screen and has until Friday to do that. Each incident had multiple charges each time (possession of marijuana, drug paraphernalia, open containers, etc.) Everything was dismissed or there was a determination not to prosecute; there were no convictions.

7	I have an employee that is currently working with us as a temporary employee from a staffing agency. Prior to that person starting as a temporary employee we had them get a pre-employment drug test done. The test results came back Negative diluted. He still brought the temporary employee on for a short term assignment. That temporary employee has now been selected to be hired for a permanent position. Due to his diluted drug test, he was told he would have to go for another drug test prior to permanent employment. That employee informed us that they would come make negative, due to visiting friends of the weekend in MA where marijuana use is legal. The state of CT is where this company is and company policy is for new hires to pass a drug test. Would there be any conflict? Seeing that person did Marijuana in a legal state?

8	I have a student employee who gave his social security card as part of his i9 verification. In the background check there was a discrepancy in that the only name associated with the card was his father. Although the name typed on the card was the student there was no association with the students name with that number. The background people said it could be because the father filled out the form for the child or the father applied for a loan or credit card using that number. My question is that is this a legal document or should we be concerned about this hire!

Recently, they have had an issue with several applications testing positive on their drug screening. Question here is: Can the employer ask applicants to put down a deposit of $30 (this covers their cost of the drug screening)? If the potential employee passes the drug screening, the employer will return the full deposit, but if they fail, the employer will keep the deposit to cover their expense. Their hope is this will eliminate applicants coming through that arent serious about their hiring process.	
2	Which forms am I required to provide a new hire in California?	
6	Question 2 of 2: We current have a de-centralized approach to recruiting and hiring and I'd like to ensure that we have a consistent methodology used by everyone involved in the process. Can you share information on best practices and hiring and recruiting and any state specific requirements for Florida, Massachusetts and South Carolina?	
7	I spoke with 2 candidates today who are on different work visas and I want to know more about the costs. The first candidate is currently on a J-1 visa until November and he said at that time, he will have sponsorship through an A3 Visa. The second candidate's husband was relocated from the UK to NYC and he is on L-1 and she is on L-2. What are the implications. These are customer service positions.	
5	Hello, we have an employee who was terminated on 2/14 but we are going to rehire him on 3/20. Does this employee need to fill out a new I9 form?	
3	Background Checks	
8	Hello. In filling out the notice to employee under the wage theft protection act, if we use a written offer letter for employment, do we mark yes for the question: Does a written agreement exist providing the rate(s) of pay? Or do we only mark yes on that question if there is an actual separate employment contract?	
2	We have employees in VA. For new hires what state specific forms are required to be provided?	
1	We check the highest level of education attained for any of our candidates. We have an applicant from South Africa who is an high school graduate. She is saying that she cannot produce anything to prove that she graduated from HS in South Africa, that HS in South Africa do no typically provide certification of graduation.	
7	An employee has an EAD card which expired but he is eligible for the automatic extension that comes with his category and getting the I797C form. How do we update his I-9 form?	
7	I had a candidate who applied on website. Not qualified for the job. We never interviewed him or anything. He responded by email, copying a photo from website and saying I guess you don't want to hire any black employees. I'm not sure if I should just ignore this or address the situation.	
8	We need to hire a couple of managers. I am wondering if you would have any information on personality testing. We have an idea of the type of personality we need, but how to find out if the candidate fits the mold? Is there a test you know of? Company that administers? Anything along those lines?	
2	Is it recommended that a facility do e-verify on new hires?	
8	We made an offer to a technician and they accepted. They have to go through their background check, etc. and we tell them not to give notice until they pass. Another manager who worked with this employee in the past is recommending he not be hired due to the past situation (driving with an expired drivers license). They want to rescind the offer based on the managers feedback.	
1	We have a manager that wants to hire a dental assistant to which he had been convicted of a felony offense of possession of a controlled substance. The manager was told that offense should be dropped to a misdemeanor, however, she had not received anything that states this. We have advised her that because he has a felony it wold not be wise to hire the individual. What type of a liability with this cause the company should she choose to move forward with the candidate?	
5	We are currently hiring for a position that requires good eyesight. Is there an eye exam I can do on the spot at interviews? Candidates do submit to a pre-employment physical where eye exam is included, but I'd like to get an idea of how good their vision is before moving on to a job offer.	
5	What should an employer be aware of when hiring in Alabama? What needs to be put in place?	
7	We had an employee come in on his first day. We do Everify and after two hours we were unable to confirm his SSN. He said he's had this problem before and walked off. Do we pay him the two hours? Should we put him in as a new hire?	
3	Agencies for background checks	
3	Who is the person in a company that should process a background check on a candidate?	
6	Regarding applicant tracking for veteran status and EEOC for govern contractor. When do we need to do that for online applications? When they apply online, or when they come in for the interview? How would we do that for sites like craigslist?	
3	Can you run a background check before an offer is made?	
3	What is required to be provided to an employee when they do a background check? They give them the FCRA summary of rights. Virginia	
6	We are in the hire process and references and background check have checked out. We are concerned about their Facebook posting however. There were some items where they were using profanity in relation to a political candidate and another where they were complaining about their previous boss to their friends.	
6	We have a couple of physicians we are looking to employ. Can we class them as ICs? One physician was hired through an agency. We pay the agency a placement and a per hour fee. The doctor says he is not getting paid enough through the agency and is asking for an IC agreement. He is a locum tenens. The other physician we are interested in hiring as an IC - it seems so vague. We would typically sign physicians under a contract. We had concerns about this individuals and we to hire her on a locum basis so we can pay her hourly as an IC. She follows protocols and there is a set schedule.	
8	Hello, I received the question below from a client & would like input. We can't comment on what other employers do of course and can only help them understand their own business: Why are our field supervisors hourly? Previously we got advice that regardless of title, if a person who was primarily in a supervisory role performed the tasks of an hourly person and was out of the office more than 50% of the time, that they had to be paid hourly. However, our competitors (including GE and Baker Hughes) pay these same guys salaried. Were getting our asses kicked trying to compete for top talent at this position, because theyre currently salaried and were telling them that they have to change to hourly. Fear of change is keeping them from coming to work for us. The ones we have hired are killing us with overtime. So were uncompetitive on hiring and then were paying above the market ... double whammy! How are our competitors paying these same guy on a salary basis?	
8	A client has a division of seasonal employees who are not offered benefits. They are drafting a document to employees and want to make sure it is correct. Seasonal and temporary employees are not eligible for enrollment for benefits. Based on the classification for this position and our insurance carrier restrictions, you are not eligible for benefits.

8	Internship programs - We would like to sponsor an employee who would like to work with us as an unpaid intern. We would like to know what types of legal documents (worker's compensation waiver) and other related documents that the employee is required to complete. The employee will be enrolling into an MBA program at a local university for 1 year. The university will monitor the students progress and request reports related to the work experience. The duration of the work experience will be for 1 year.	
3	In regards to background checks, Federal law does not prohibit employers from conducting background checks before an offer of employment is made. State laws, however, may have restrictions. Although in most states a standard background check can be conducted prior to an offer, a small number of states do not allow it. Can you confirm what states? Presuming best practice is to send a background check after sending the contract. Please advise.	
5	I want to hire an employee for a short term contract. The resource wants to be an employee and get health care benefits rather than a contractor. The contract may be short, initially like 3 months with the option to renew. I'm concerned hiring an employee for a short term contract and needing to terminate the employee after the contract. 1. Can I do this? Or do I risk a lawsuit for terminating? 2. If i can terminate, what language do I need in the contract to protect our company regarding any potential legal ramifications.	
5	Under what section in a job description should the "ability to travel X% of time" be written?	
8	It has to do with the I-9 form. I'm putting together a training on how to fill them out properly. The last part, section 2, where employer fills out. It says employer business or origination name and address. What would we put in that part because we have so many different names? Should we put the location name the employee is working at or the over all name? Would we put the DBA names or the legal name? Would the address be the head quarters address or the location where the employee is located?	
6	We have hired an intern who is under 18 - can we send him for a drug test which is our normal hiring protocol or do we need his parents permission?	
1	Offer of employment for an applicant who wants to work a specific shift. She wants to work 730-4 but the hours are 8-430. Are we obligated to let her work 730 -400 if it's due to daycare issues?	
6	We are hiring a foreign student from India for 10 weeks as an intern. She goes to the University of Texas in Dallas. What documentation do I need to make sure that I collect for payroll purposes?	
8	What would you do if you found out someone owed a ton of personal income tax (they were listed in a newspaper article on a list of people who owed an exorbitant amount of income tax ). The position this person would fill would have access to a company credit card for purchasing travel and other company related items, and also to some petty cash. I like the candidate and the individual is qualified for the position, but Im a bit torn about what Ive discovered. I dont want to be paranoid, thinking that this individual would be dishonest because I dont know all the facts. During the background check, do I need to include a credit check, as well? The position is not in Accounting, so money access is limited and only as directed. Should I ask the candidate about this?	
1	Can we accept a social security card with the wrong name as a "list C" document on the I-9? If her drivers' license was used for "list B" document and has her current/correct name?	
6	We are hiring a consultant. What paperwork do we need them to complete? What are state and federal guidlines? I want to make sure I am giving them every thing I need to give them. Thank you	
5	Job applications Sales position opening and wondering if I have to interview everyone who submitted a resume?	
3	I have a question on the possible new CA rule on background check. Working on updating my employee Handbook and would like to know if the background check should be performed during a conditional offer of employment or during the probationary period? Please email response.	
3	If we complete a background check on a potential employee that comes back with results that cause us not to hire that individual, is there anything that we should/are required to do other the sending them a declination letter?	
7	A volunteer had something come up on his record regarding indecency with a child and he was on the sex offender registry. We sent the pre-adverse action notice and he said this should not have come up that it was dismissed. We directed him to the background check company and afterwards, we received information stating the record was dismissed and everything is clean. Can we still take action based on what we saw before?	
7	During a job interview a candidate volunteered that he has had multiple shoulder surgeries. We operate quarries and the job is very physically demanding. Before extending an offer, can we ask to see a release from the doctor? If we wait until after an offer to see a release, how would we handle if he refuses? Could we require a fitness for duty after a conditional offer? This hire will be in Iowa.	
2	From : gina@dixon-associates.com Subject : FW: New Health Insurance Marketplace Coverage Good afternoon, Would you be able to provide me with the below highlighted items? From: Maria Soloperto [mailto:MSoloperto@Komangs.com] Sent: Monday, March 20, 2017 10:49 AM To: Gina Chase Subject: New Health Insurance Marketplace Coverage Good morning Gina, I am trying to figure out where to go for certain documents that I believe newly hired employee's should be supplied with at DOH. 1. New Health Insurance Marketplace Coverage Options Form. The one that I have which is filled out but outdated is OMB No. 1210-0149 (Expires 11-30-2013). Also we currently are not supplying any Notice of COBRA continuation coverage notices upon hire, or any of the state mandated notices that I believe are required. Are you the "go to" person for a question like this?	
7	An employee brought me his receipt from the SSA for his SS card. How do I enter that on the I-9? How do I complete the I-9 when he brings me the actual card?	
8	Candidate came up on the sex offender register; violent crime from 2008. Can the employer not move forward with the hire?

4	When calling on references, what questions are we allowed to ask? Can we ask if the company would hire that candidate back?	
7	I received the below question from a client. Can you please assist? We have a project that we need help with for a short period of time. Management is proposing that we bring on an individual as a consultant. Since its such a short amount of time, we dont want to hire him as we couldnt provide full time work for him. This individual doesnt have a business where he does this type of thing. Were just looking for his input and experience to help us out. My thought is that we really cant bring him on as a consultant. Wed pay him more than the $600 limit and need to 1099 him. And since he doesnt do this as a business that wouldnt work. Also he wouldnt be covered under our workers comp if he was a consultant, so hed need to have his own coverage. Can you give us some advice on what our options are in this situation?	
4	We really like the "Employment Application-Professional" Form, however, due to the nature of our work we would like to ask about criminal history, can this question be added to the form?	
4	We have a new manager who will be interviewing for the first time. Do have any resources which would assist her in learning about interviewing? What questions to ask and now ask?	
3	Im new with the company. They have been doing Drug and Background screening. We run a convenience store business and there is lots of turnover. We were doing the background screen first, but found at least 30% don't show for the drug test. We switched the order of drug screening first, then background check. Is there anything that prohibits the drug screening first?

5	I'm looking for a template for an agreement that our company might sign with a person (local Mexican consultant) to pay him for candidate referrals who we would hire.	
8	I am thinking it may be time to change our procedures when it comes to background screenings. In the past, the supervisor or manager request that HR runs the background screenings and we send it back to the supervisor/manager for review. I have gone to different HR seminars/webinars and they mention that supv/mgmt. should not be looking at them after they have been run; that we should only disclosed they have met the qualifications to be hired. Can you provide your thoughts and recommendations in regards to disclosing screenings to anyone outside of HR? Can you also provide recommendation on where the drug screen results should be filed? Currently we file in an employee file (not personnel file) with a section tab called background screenings. Recently, one of my staff has gone to a HR seminar and was told they should be filed with the medical file.	
8	Good Morning, The client that is having an HR issue is Wisconsin based not Illinois based. Can this please be corrected? Thank you.	
6	We require candidates to complete applications. We have candidates come to us via temporary agencies and 3rd party recruiters. When we do a direct hire or to temp to hire, should have candidates complete our company's application prior to initiating the pre-employment screening process/giving the offer? From previous experience I believe we are supposed to but I cannot find any regulation to support that.	
7	we are having an issue with the employee name suffix. we have employees that have JR in their name. the DL does not have it, the social does and when he fills out his I-9 he does not include it. He also does not use it on his signature. What legal name should we use in our employee system and on the new hire paperwork? should we make him include the JR? We have always used what the employee uses on his I-9 as the name for our employee file. Please help

4	Can an employer ask for a yes/no response about disability status on a job application?

Thanks.	
1	We have an employee with a H-4 visa. She has this visa because her husband has a H1-B visa.

8	We have a very specific process that we following when hiring employees. The protocol includes posting the job internally and externally. We had several interviews and picked the best candidate.

6	We have decided to hire a paid intern, what paperwork do they need to complete? Do they need to complete an Application, W-4 & I9? Do we need to present them with all the WC, EDD and Sexual Harassment brochures?	
8	Good Afternoon, We currently employ 88 f/t employees. Now that the I-9 Form has been updated, do we need to submit it to anyone? We currently just collect the new hires two forms of ID and have them complete the I-9 and we complete our sections as well. We keep the I-9's on file. Is this the correct way to handle it? Also, can you please advise the best way to handle employee's personal files, medical records, disciplinary actions, training records, etc... Thank you, Kellie Morningstar

Are there any limitations in what the contract states? For example patient ownership, examination billing, whose responsible for lease, equipment, employees etc. Thanks for your help.	
5	what tools are available that all me to pre-screen employees for problems with absenteeism	
8	We are hiring a new Executive Director and part of our hiring practices for these positions is to perform a credit check. This individual will have access to cash flow, etc. Therefore, it is relevant to the job. However, the candidate is pushing back stating that in the state of NV it is illegal to perform a credit check. Is this true?	
4	When should you ask a potential employee to complete a background check form. Is it ok to ask them during the 1st interview, after or before	
8	(spoke to user's spouse: Gladys - suggested she get added as a user) We put our employees through a 12 tests process. One employee had 4 positive tests out of the 12. The testing vendor said the employee has prescriptions for these 4 positives so truly they're not positive. How should I process this employee? I want to reduce liability for the company. The employee says he'll take these medicines at night.	
3	I have a question regarding best practices when selecting aliases to run a criminal search background check. There are times where it is cost prohibitive to run all found aliases for a candidate (40+). We do want to ensure that we are doing our due diligence, however.

They sent him for a drug test and havent gotten the drug test back. Theyd still like to offer him employment, but he would be an auto tech and from time to time would be required to drive a car on their lot. Theyre wondering from a liability standpoint, can they offer him employment or not offer him? They offered contingent upon passing the drug test. Their insurance requires everyone to sign off as drug free as they all may drive company vehicles at some point, so the insurance company probably wouldn't allow the hire.	
3	We are hiring an employee through a temp-to-hire agency. However, we perform background checks on all our employees. This temporary employee will have access to confidential information and we would like to perform a background on their before they come on board.

What do I need to be aware of? Can he work until his documents come in? I know him personally, and I know his parents and I know they are US citizens.	
8	I scheduled an in-person interview with an applicant. They showed up on the wrong Monday and thus will have to come back next Monday to interview. Our front office caught wind of this as they see the applicants come in the door. The position being filled is for the front office. They now know that the applicant got the wrong day. Since the position is a billing & scheduling specialist, I do feel they made a bad impression as they scheduled wrong already. Is it legal to cancel an interview I already scheduled based off of this information? Or should I go forth with the interview knowing they won't be a good fit? There are many qualified applicants and this is one of many interviews scheduled. It's already a tough competition as it is. Over 150 applications came in within a few weeks for this position.

6	Hello! We are having trouble identifying international students during the hiring process. Currently, we do not participate in the OPT and CPT programs for individuals with F-1 visas. However, we are hiring people who received work authorization through another company and then applying with us. They do not disclose on the front end that they are international students, and we have been having issues deducting SS and medicaid/medicare taxes from their paychecks and then having to reimburse them. What are different options for us to uncover their how they have received work authorization without being discriminatory or breaking any hiring laws?	
8	To whom this may concern: I recently completed an I-9 audit on all current and termed employee files for our company. I noticed that new forms need to be filled out by all current employees as section 2 and 3 was never filled out by the employer and the form being used was expired. Do you have a sample document of an I-9 audit memo that I can distribute to my employees to inform them of why an audit was done and what needs to be done and why a new I-9 needs to be completed. I appreciate any help that can provided to me. Thank you- Kayla W.

4	We have a question regarding the legal ability to ask about an employees ability to work in the US. Legally we can ask if the individual is authorized to work in the US. However, we are an ITAR facility and in order to be compliant we can only hire a US Person (Citizen, permanent resident, green card holder). Can we be more specific in our question regarding the candidates ability to comply with this requirement?	
8	One of our entities where we have corporate oversight to, hires temps to come work at their site. They assign temporary access cards into the worksite for the day so they can perform their jobs for that time period. It turns out that they just hired someone who is the son of an employee. The son is hired through the temp agency and theyre having that employee work in the office as an intern. This person is an intern, the person he would be reporting to is a family member, and theyre asking for him to be given access to the HRIS system, which would give him access to payroll, etc.	
3	Hi- to explain in a little more detail. We have in the past come across a background check where the SSN search has come up with 40 or so names, anything reported associated with that SSN. Often its nicknames, misspellings, maiden names etc. However, we then have to decide which aliases to then run a county criminal search on, and there is a cost associated with each name. This is where we struggle on deciding what needs to be run. Thanks, Kayleigh	
7	We have an employee that may come back with a positive test result. He was informed that he would be subject to a drug screen, but he did not sign an authorization form for us to perform the test. Would this be a problem?	
8	We normally run a criminal background check and driving record for all of our employees. We have a few people that we just hired from out of state. They live in Nevada, but are working for us in Minnesota (and residing here in the meantime as well). I sent the criminal and driving records request over to the company that we use and they said that they can not run a criminal check on them unless their drivers license says they are living in MN. I am told Nevada has very strict rules on who can see that information. Could you please guide me in the right direction so that I can complete our process for these new hires?	
7	I'm about to enter an I-9 in E-Verify. He gave a final decree of adoption as a List C document. That is not on the List. Can we let him know that we cannot accept it?	
3	During interviews, we have all candidates fill out three forms to speed up the process, in the chance that they do receive an offer: 1) An application 2) Background check form 3) Drug test waiver form These three forms, along with their resume, is kept on file. There is nothing that is done with them, unless they receive an offer. My question is, if we do not give an offer, is it okay to shred the application, background check form, and drug test (for a lack of space)? That way, we only keep the resumes on file? My second question is, how long do we need to keep the resumes on file for? Thank you

The social worker in charge of her Mother's case was the one who pressed charges and she was found guilty.	
3	The people who apply to volunteer with our non-profit complete a DOJ live-scan background check that they pay for.

There is a form to be complete by HR and then the employee must sign it. Is that information I am allowed to share with a 3rd party in respects to an employee's background screen.

1	I am going through a full internal audit of our I-9 files and have found several things that need fixing that I am not 100% sure about. My questions are listed below. My predecessor, Brittany, in signing the Forms I-9 of new employees, signed and dated both the Section 2 signature line AND the Section 3 signature line. None of these people were rehired or changed names or anything this was just an error she made on more than a few forms. I was wondering if I needed to cross it out/redo those pages without her signature in Section 3. (I discovered this because one of the employees just changed her name to her husbands last name and there is no place for me to sign off on that name change since Brittany already signed there.) One of our former employees left the SSN line blank on her I-9 section 1 and Brittany filled it in for her. I was wondering if there was any action needed here or if, since its a former employee, we can just let it go. We began in March of last year to p	
8	I received the following inquiry: "A question was raised about the sensitivity of asking about work availability from folks with a military commitment, particular people in the Reserves. How can interviewers better understand fit based on work schedule availability beyond simply stating the required work schedule for the vacancy?" In my opinion, in order to stay away from any potential discriminatory questions, I feel the safest bet would to just stick with the question of "Do you meet the availability requirements outlines in the job description?" However, any direction or advise your team could give would be so helpful. Thank you! - Paige Miller PhysAssist/TeamHealth

8	We are a staffing agency in Texas and have a dilemma on a background check. We have a client that referred an employee to us and asked us to onboard him so could start working for them. When our branch ran the background the results came back with a charge of sex offender. To be honest with you, the person who reviews the background checks automatically disqualifies any one with this type of charge and Pre adverse and adverse letter are sent. The employee reached out to us, the corporate office to complaint and now he is telling us that we disqualify him from this position as he was told by the client that he didn't meet our background check requirements so he couldn't work for them. The client doesn't have any type of background check requirements and the employee has told me that the client know about the charges and they are okay with that. We are in the process of investigating it from the client but need to know what to do and if we are in the wrong for disqualifying Sex Offender.

When she did go the clinic the approval had expired and the clinic called the employer. An unauthorized employee answered and could not find the HRM so he authorized the clinic to do the test. The employer would like to rescind the offer? Issues?	
1	An individual was hired at a property and was not able to furnish a social security card and had some trouble obtaining a copy at the SSA because the last name was incorrect.

Is that acceptable?

8	> > A new business would like to do some job shadowing before the individual is hired. What are the limitations or risks in doing this? > > > Our Response: > If an individual is simply shadowing (watching) and performs absolutely no work, and the purpose of the shadowing is simply for a realistic job preview (not a skills assessment) the risk is minimal. Anyone visiting the business is covered by the general liability insurance, again provided these individuals are performing no work, the individual would be like any other visitor on the employer site. > > If this individual is asked to perform work to show his or her skills, it has become an employment relationship, with I-9, minimum wage, and wage payment timing rules the employer must comply with. The question becomes whether te employer is going to take a risk and have the individual receive a 1099, or be more compliant from a wage and hour perspective and hire the person for the day, which creates potential termination issues if the person is rejected (terminated). > > Please note that the information provided herein is practical HR, not legal advice.

8	Regarding my last question - I was referring to when candidates request a copy of the completed background report. There is a box that candidates check-off on the background authorization form requesting a copy. When this is checked, the employer must mail the completed report within 3 business days of receipt under ICRA. What is the regulation under FCRA and CCRAA (if it is addressed under these two acts)? The question was not about the adverse action process/ltr. Sorry for not being clear.

This past week the individual was in one of our yards performing manual labor. They sent the hours to payroll to pay the person. The president said he is going to pay him personally, because he isnt an employee. But he was performing work on the yard, cleaning up, etc. Should the individual be paid through the company as a w-2 employee or would it be okay for the president to pay him privately or as an independent contractor?

8	We just found out that our clerk's office has been running background checks prior to interviewing candidates. In addition, when they pull driving license checks, they will use it as a tie-breaker for equally qualified candidates, selecting the one who has the fewest tickets. They go one step further, in that if the not-selected candidate with numerous tickets applies for another position, they don't grant them an interview. I'm trying to find verbiage where this is unlawful (in addition to being not recommended). Can someone direct me to a law or statute?

8	We have an applicant that we have made an offer to who was accused of having a less than professional interaction with one of our vendors, prior to starting. It was during the drug screen. The manager obtained the applicant's side of the story and it may not be as severe as it was initially made out to be. We aren't necessarily considering rescinding the offer but it did make us wonder what the risk would be if there were a situation where we did want to rescind an offer which had already been made.	
8	Hello. One of our practices in Florida interviewed a technician who disclosed during the interview that she has a back condition that is so bad she had to be honorably discharged from the military. She noted that she is aware of the physical demands of the job, and has no needed accommodations. The practice is concerned because they have had 2 workers comp insurers drop them, mainly due to new employees with health conditions exacerbating their conditions on the job and filing for workers comp. We know that an employee may not be discriminated against for a health condition. The practice is wondering if there is anything they can do to 1. Protect themselves from this employee also exacerbating her condition and 2. to get further clarification about the condition to ensure the employee will actually be able to perform the manual labor required in this position. Thank you in advance!	
6	I'm trying to understand the I-9 process. Do we need to update old I-9 forms each time a new version comes out? How do we handle a situation when we think documents we're receiving are invalid or false? If we do E-verify, do we need to do it on all new hires and active employees?	
6	We are starting to review our background check process and it has been some time since we have reviewed it. What are the best practices for ensuring compliance with FCRA; how are people communicating decisions to applicants? All of our hires are in Ohio and we use a third party agency to conduct the checks (ADP). We started looking at Sterling as well in terms of turnaround time. The representative started talking about adverse actions, etc. If we were to not inform people that a criminal record was the basis for the decision; would that be problematic?	
8	We are doing fabric cutting (apparel manufacturing) service. We have a candidate who will be 18 years old in a few months and is a drop-out from school.

And any codes or regulation of EDD the employer should be aware of and follow?	
8	It's regarding the 1-9 storage and inspection. My understanding is because we using the Compigo system, they said we can sign and store all I-9s digitally. I just want to verify this correct. Do we have to have paper documents along with the electronic files?

4	Hello. During a telephone screening call, am I permitted to ask the potential candidate if they need H-1 visa sponsorship?

8	We are a staffing agency. Before we place a candidate they come in for a group interview so that a Recruiter can meet them and discuss what jobs they are interested in and gauge professionalism, experience etc. It could be weeks to months down the road that the candidate is then placed in a job, and sometimes the Recruiters rely on those group interview notes to gauge personality/culture fit. What, if anything, can we include in the notes on a candidate regarding hairstyle, visible tattoos/facial piercings, attitude, and/or employment authorization expiration for F1 students on temporary visas? thank you for your help!	
6	We are looking to hire a temporary employee for approximately a 4 month assignment in Georgia. We do not have any other temporary employees and we don't have an associate handbook or policies for temporary positions, since we never use them. What is the recommendation for details the offer letter should include to ensure clear requirements for their assignment? Any kind of contract for the assignment will not nullify the at-will employment relationship, correct? Also, all permanent employees are given holidays as paid. Are we required to also pay the temporary employee for those holidays?

6	Business client is getting creative regarding temp to perm hire. We usually do an agency hire - bring in a temp, and then if position works out, we post it internally to see if a current employee would be interested. We are being asked by the temporary agency to provide a temp to perm opportunity offer letter stating what the expected full time salary would be should things work out. Not sure if we are comfortable doing this and wanted to seek another opinion.	
7	we rec'd a drug screen back for a potential new hire and it came back negative but was noted as "safety sensitive concern for potentially sedating medications". Are we allowed to ask this guy what medications he is taking? And, If we hired him, he would be on different jobsites and possibly be on lifts so do we have right to tell him that even though he passed drug test, due to the safety concern of his meds, we feel he would not be a good fit for this position?	
8	2. I-9 where it asks individual for place of residence, some expats coming over, they don't have an address up front. Can they use the hotel address? I don't think they can use the employers address.	
6	We have a lot of seasonal hiring because of summer camp. Last year we left everyone active in payroll system as we only pay a fee for the number of checks we run. Do we have to redo all the paperwork for hire again? I'm mainly concerned about the I-9 and its process.	
7	We are going to be hiring a consultant. Since I have been here, we havent been involved in hiring someone that will come into the office and work from here regularly. This is a CPA and he may eventually become an employee, but for now he is going to work on projects for our clients. He will work from our office and will use the office of a retired employee, having access to a desk computer/equipment. He will bring his own laptop though. From the payroll side we know we do a 1099. We want to talk about other ways to onboard a consultant. We have a consultant agreement with him. Do we have them sign off on our handbook and policies? Do we have them attend our trainings? We dont need an I-9 because hes not an employee, correct? Where is the line between treating like an employee versus an independent contractor/consultant?	
5	What is your recommendation on having specific lifting requirements in a job description? Example: Should we include a 25 lbs requirement in an Office Assistant job description if it is not essential to the job? And, how often should the job description and physical requirements be reviewed?

7	Candidate was extended an offer however he did not fill out his application factually in that he had a previous conviction; background check showed one prior misdemeanor and one pending. Should the employer provide the pre-adverse action notice?	
6	Need some information regarding E-Verify. We are a very small company and currently maintain I-9 Forms for all our employees and have them provide 2 forms of ID and retain that information on file according to retention rules. We recently hired a student from India that needs to update his I-983 form and requires the E- Verified number of the company to submit to his school In order to extend his work authorization. To my knowledge we have never registered with E-verify so we don't have a verified number for the company. If I register, will that mean that we will have to start to use E-verify for all employees and register all our employees going forward.

As most of the paperwork was filled out, the Manager spoke with the applicant and he seemed inebriated to included slurred speech. Once the applicant left, the Manager contacted HR. Our question is, do we have to hire this applicant? The Manager would rather not. NOTE: No background has been ran, no written offer was given. Only verbal offer over the phone.	
1	I have a new employee and am completing the Form I-9. She said she does not yet have a social security number. How does this work for E-verify?	
8	We pay a referral bonus currently and are considering differentiating the bonus based on the role. If someone refers a senior level staff member they get one amount and for other roles they get less. This seems discriminatory - is this approach common?

1	QUESTION Hello, We have a Federal Cobra group, in Philadelphia, PA, with the following question: We have an employee we would like to hire. Her immediate supervisor, Rudy, asked her to come in and fill out paperwork and provide her documents for the I-9. She filled out all documents and listed her name as GENA BELL and when I looked at her copy of her documents, she had her SS card listed as GENA BELL and her PA Driver's License listed as GINA BELL. I asked Rudy to find out why the discrepancy and to please find out if she had a passport or any other document listed in column A on the I-9 to prove her correct name. She stated that GINA on her license was an error that she never got corrected, and she does not have a passport. She stated she does have her voter registration card, which is listed under column B on the I-9, and she will bring it in tomorrow to provide her 2nd requirement for the I-9 for GENA BELL. She also said she was going to go to the DMV and attempt to get her spelling of her name corrected. If she comes in tomorrow with the voter registration spelled GENA BELL does that fulfill her I-9 requirements since I already have a copy of her SS card? (that would be both B & C documents). In addition to that, should we ask for a copy of her PA License once she gets it corrected to GENA BELL? (I'm not even sure if we are legally allowed to do that?) Also, as we discussed, she has worked for large companies in the past (Marriot, Sheraton, etc.) and stated she never had a problem with this before. Is there anything else we should/shouldn't do in this unique situation? I await your reply. Thanks! Best regards, Lisa L.

3	Question from our client MDV: They want to know if they are required to send the adverse action letters for both a drug test or just a criminal background check? Also, what is the potential penalty if a letter is not sent? If an applicant is not hired because they lied on their application which is discovered during a background check. They were not hired officially because they lied on the application. Does that still justify a adverse letter? Also if an applicant discloses criminal activity during an interview done by a background check provider prior to a check actually being performed. Would they still be required to generate a letter?

We are currently posting flyers around the company that read " $ 500 bonus for both you and NEW experienced Insulator! * new applicant needs 3+ years of insulation experience.

We chose who we thought were the best candidates to interview, made our decision, and then sent notice to all applicants that the position had filled. We now have several applicants who we did not interview that are asking for feedback. We're happy to provide feedback, we just wanted to see if there was anything that we should/shouldn't say from an HR perspective.
