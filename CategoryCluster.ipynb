The lawyer is advising me, but we have a very small space. It will be a scene if we do it with everybody else there. Should I have them clear the office? How do I do this without tipping her off? I am not physically there so my attending will be a tip off. I am worried she will start videotaping and that it will be a full blown scene. I am worried about the other employees more than her at this point. I want to minimize the impact on our small staff. We have 3 reporters, one of whom is being terminated. The other reporters feel like she is being treated unfairly. Many days she does not come in until 12 (after PT). Should the manager set the meeting? How do we get the lap top? I can have a thumb drive to drag personal stuff onto it? Can we hold her final check if she does not return the equipment?

We realize that she may decide to end her employment with us over this change in compensation package.

      "ThinkHR Team, Please review the question posed by my client, Level 5, LLC below highlighted in yellow. We appreciate your thoughts and comments with regards to the GA DOL regs and state law. Per our discussion, heres the email from Brad that he wanted to propose to the owners. Could you please verify that we are in compliance with any Georgia Department of Labor regulations pertaining to vacation payout and termination/resignation concerns. Thank you for your assistance. I am considering a revision to the vacation policy. I will need to submit the policy to the partners for approval. The proposal: 1. Two weeks vacation - new hires earn vacation hours out of the gate but must work 6 months to get the benefit of vacation. 2. After 4 years the employee begins earning an additional week so that they have 3 weeks vacation in year 5. 3. After 8 years the employee begins earning an additional week so that they earn 4 weeks vacation in year 9. 4. Carry over: * It is our intent that our employees utilize vacation not save it up. * Two weeks is the maximum carry over * Upon Resignation or termination, vacation paid to employees is a maximum of 4 weeks. I want to make sure that they approach above does not materially differ from our current policy in terms of resignation or termination. I also want to make sure that it is legal, meaning they have 6 weeks carried over if the employee has been with the company longer than 8 years but we are only paying 4 weeks.\n",

I know right now we do not pay out the personal leave and the handbook states that, but they are thinking about doing it for the vacation leave as well. Also if you can are you able to stipulate that they would not pay it out for salary employees, but will for hourly employees?\" Thanks! ***\n",

This isn't during a reduction in force, but more for when a high level executive isn't performing well and will be relieved of their duties but given a generous severance package. We want to be generous but also understand laws in giving someone time to consider the package presented. Is there a minimum amount of days we're supposed to give for someone to consider the package presented? Follow-up, what are some other \"nice\" things to give someone in a severance package besides $$? We've given people the use of a recruiter or outplacement services in the past. Candice Qualls\n",
