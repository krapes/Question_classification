3	Via vmail: I have a question about a one month resignation I received from an employee. After the client found out he would be resigning, they wanted to sever the agreement. We no longer require the employee's services because of this so we would like to cut the one month short. 805-234-1601

3	An employer (grocery store) subtracts any register shortages from their employee's paychecks. The employer ensures that even with the shortage deductions that employee meets the minimum wage requirements each paycheck. If an employee terminates and still "owes" the company money based on previous register shortages, can the employer pull the remaining balance from the individual's paycheck even if this causes the employee to hit under the minimum wage hourly rate?	
6	In CA can we force an employee to have their final check issued by direct deposit vs a live check?	
0	We are working on calculating an annual leave (PTO) payout. I want to understand how the daily rate would be calculated. So if an employee is accruing a certain number of days, in order to pay out that value, how would we calculate the daily rate? We are planning a termination and we are told vacation accrues every day. What is the accrual rate? Do they accrue for all hours? If he works a portion of the pay period, how many hours accrued?	
4	We have an employee who has only been with us for 3 weeks. She's been coming in late, forgetting to clock in/out and last Friday she was a no call/no show. She eventually called to say she'd been in a car accident and would need to be off for Monday too. When I went to cover her shift I discovered that the places she was to been cleaning have not been properly cleaned I'd like to terminate her. Am I okay to do so considering the reason she is out is due to a health reason (car accident).	
2	Do you have access to or have any benchmark data for executive employment agreements as it relates to severance payments. Specifically for a company with around 175 employees in Tennessee. I found a Lee Hecht Harrison and a world at work study. It's difficult to compare to those since company size is important.	
6	Quick Question - we had an individual resign recently. His last day is Friday. I presume that his final paycheck should include his accrued but unused vacation hours?	
1	I spoke to our local police and I will terminate her today and the police will be on site. I have documented all identified fraudulent activity. I also called our liability specialist. I am concerned for what happens after today. I need to make restoration with my clients. I am concerned that when I reach out to them if one of them gets upset there could be a approach that they make against us. Are we in a position to get the money from her?	
1	We are an At Will state (but also have remote employees in various other states), what level of documentation is needed to terminate employment. Cant we just say not a fit? I would like to further officially understand the at will and needed documentation surrounding it.	
1	We have a longer term manager we are seeking to terminate. We recently discovered there have been coupon/discounts that this manager have applied spanning a 2 year period, however these cannot be substantiated in the reporting (e.g. coupons not present, etc.). We do intent to get the police involved. Is the police report necessary to terminate?	
5	We have an issue with a long time employee. This employee has been with the company for many years. He has been counseled and written up on no less than two separate occasions for asking female employees out to lunch or to get a drink. Even after being spoken to about it he then tries to apologize by bringing them flowers and asking them out again. We have had another incident with him, and we have decided that this is the final straw. We are planning to terminate, however, the CEO wants to offer him the choice of resigning (mentioning retirement) and allowing this to be his two weeks' notice. What are your thoughts about this?	
1	Exempt employee provided notice through this Friday but is not returning this week, are we required to pay her for the holidays?	
4	Is Erin available? I am at the end of a long termination. We are ready to terminate her. We held off because we were trying to close a round of funding. The lawyer is advising me, but we have a very small space. It will be a scene if we do it with everybody else there. Should I have them clear the office? How do I do this without tipping her off? I am not physically there so my attending will be a tip off. I am worried she will start videotaping and that it will be a full blown scene. I am worried about the other employees more than her at this point. I want to minimize the impact on our small staff. We have 3 reporters, one of whom is being terminated. The other reporters feel like she is being treated unfairly. Many days she does not come in until 12 (after PT). Should the manager set the meeting? How do we get the lap top? I can have a thumb drive to drag personal stuff onto it? Can we hold her final check if she does not return the equipment? The separation agreement requires the computer and any other equipment be returned.	
0	ThinkHR Team, Please review the question posed by my client, Level 5, LLC below highlighted in yellow. We appreciate your thoughts and comments with regards to the GA DOL regs and state law. Per our discussion, heres the email from Brad that he wanted to propose to the owners. Could you please verify that we are in compliance with any Georgia Department of Labor regulations pertaining to vacation payout and termination/resignation concerns. Thank you for your assistance. I am considering a revision to the vacation policy. I will need to submit the policy to the partners for approval. The proposal: 1. Two weeks vacation - new hires earn vacation hours out of the gate but must work 6 months to get the benefit of vacation. 2. After 4 years the employee begins earning an additional week so that they have 3 weeks vacation in year 5. 3. After 8 years the employee begins earning an additional week so that they earn 4 weeks vacation in year 9. 4. Carry over: * It is our intent that our employees utilize vacation not save it up. * Two weeks is the maximum carry over * Upon Resignation or termination, vacation paid to employees is a maximum of 4 weeks. I want to make sure that they approach above does not materially differ from our current policy in terms of resignation or termination. I also want to make sure that it is legal, meaning they have 6 weeks carried over if the employee has been with the company longer than 8 years but we are only paying 4 weeks.	
3	I've got a company with 225 employees in Texas. They are in 11 other states. They are wanting to set up a form for deductions from final paychecks. If somebody steals or takes more vacation than they have, can we deduct that. California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, North Carolina, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, Texas. Negative paid time off balances, and loss to the company, stolen money, equipment.	
4	We are restructuring our staff, bringing on 1 to 2 new positions, and changing staff compensation plans. The compensation package that we offer our outside sales person is going to change substantially. She would have the potential to make the receive the same or more compensation under the new plan, but it would require increased revenue generation on her part (more sales annually). We realize that she may decide to end her employment with us over this change in compensation package. (The job description is not changing in any substantial way so the position is not being eliminated rather it will be compensated in a different manner.) If she chooses to leave based on the change in compensation, is she eligible to apply for unemployment?	
4	We terminated an employee and lost the unemployment claim so now we are making sure An employee was counseled on the 30th regarding excessive absenteeism and tardiness. On Monday she said she would be late - I told her to take care of her vehicle and I understand. Today I got a text 30 minutes before she is to be here and she will be late today as well. In the warning that she signed it said she could have no further tardy for six months. Can we terminate? Will she have a successful unemployment claim?	
1	We have an employee that just offered their 30 days notice. They have been sworn into the Air Force as an officer. Does this change our ability to release immediately? Will we have to pay the resignation period?	
2	Are there any recent (last 24 months) severance agreement cases that provided favorable outcomes to employees with under 25 employees? Are severance agreements advised for groups that size if they have a clear employee handbook signed at hire? What states require severance?	
1	After 12 months we'll terminate an employee from benefits who has a workers' comp claim, we will also be terminating them as employee. How best should we communicate this to employees. Our lawyer and carriers have said that this policy is okay? .	
6	Final pay for California, must we pay on final date of employment or do we have 72 hours?	
3	It only is a docx. There is no link to the three forms listed.	
1	We have found one of our front desk employees has put a resume on the company computer. We have a policy that states employees may not use company equipment (including the computer) for anything other than business reasons. We want to terminate her.	
0	We do vacation/personal time as PTO all lumped together. Employees accrue time each pay period. If someone leaves and they have a negative balance, can I deducted those hours from the last paycheck. These are PTO hours we paid them for, but they had not accrued the time yet. ( essentially overpaid PTO)	
5	Calling on behalf of Pate Trucking Company: They are for profit in TX with almost 200 employees. A supervisor (employed since 2014) was out on surgery leave 5/4-5/29 unbeknownst to HR. He came back to work and worked for several weeks and the manager terminated him this past Friday for performance issues. There was no prior discipline. FMLA was not designated but he is exempt and they continued to pay him and the deductions continued. He came back to the exact same position. He is over age 40. We don't detail of the performance issues. He called and said he couldn't be terminated because FMLA was not designated. His supervisor is under age 40.	
2	Do you have a proprietary data form for exiting employees to sign? Currently have a non-disclosure/no-compete policy in place. Thanks very much, Mindy	
1	I checked our online enrollment system and it does not appear to specifically ask the employee to consent to the deductions. Can we still take them?

4	We let a receptionist go on Friday. We did not have a lot of work for her and she said she understood at the time. She has now come back and is saying we should have given her severance pay etc. She is asking that we give her a formal letter of dismissal.

3	We have a client that had employee access an HR document that included employee SSNs and salary information. The document had been accidentally saved to a shared drive and was not password protected. The employee that accessed the document then used the salary information to try and negotiate his salary. They want to know if this could be considered grounds for immediate dismissal and what is their PI obligation is to all other employees now that they know SSNs were accessed. Thanks!	
0	When calculating final pay for an employee and vacation. If the vacation is not earned until the employee has been here one year, are we required to pay it out if they leave prior to their year anniversary? What are the guidelines about providing employment references/verifications?	
4	An employee started in housekeeping last Monday. She has a terrible attitude and didn't show up for work Friday. Saturday she showed up and said she didn't know she was scheduled to work Friday. I met with her yesterday and wrote up a verbal warning. She got an accident (car) yesterday and said she was fine. She called in today and I told her we are terminating employment. She told me she was going to have to hire a lawyer because she is 3 months pregnant and ordered to work (we did not tell her that). She said one of her coworkers texted her saying you better come to work or you will lose her job. The employee denies the request. I told her to come in and get her check and she said she paid this other employee for the uniform, which that employee also denies. We did know she was pregnant. The employee was training her in the laundry. She is not a lead necessarily. She said she had to to go to the doctor. She has told people she is thinking about not keeping the baby and she has to go in for drug testing and somebody thought she went in for her required testing. She says no told her she was supposed to work on Friday. Should I rescind the termination?	
3	Can we get a template for layoffs for a construction company?

4	We have a WA employee who did not participate in our active open enrollment, therefore, since no selections were made her benefits were canceled. She is now calling in sick repeatedly but claims she can not provide a doctors note since we canceled her coverage. Are we allowed to separate employment?	
1	Hello, What is either the best practice or federal guideline for giving someone time to consider a severance package. This isn't during a reduction in force, but more for when a high level executive isn't performing well and will be relieved of their duties but given a generous severance package. We want to be generous but also understand laws in giving someone time to consider the package presented. Is there a minimum amount of days we're supposed to give for someone to consider the package presented? Follow-up, what are some other "nice" things to give someone in a severance package besides $$? We've given people the use of a recruiter or outplacement services in the past. Candice Qualls	
4	Our client has an employee who filed a WC claim upon her return from a hunting vacation. It was brought to our attention that this same employee advised and instructed anther employee to file a WC claim. Additionally, her husband settled a large WC claim with his employer. Our client would like to terminate her employment as it seems that she may be creating a morale issue among the workforce.	
5	An employee was recently in the hospital for a non-work related illness. He left the hospital against medical advice and has not worked since his hospitalization. His supervisor subsequently advised him that in order to return to work he would need a doctor's note before returning. It's been two weeks since the employee spoke with his supervisor and he called today to request that he be laid off. He advised he feels he is not able to return to work because he does not believe he can do the physical labor associated with his job. He also stated that if he was laid off he would be eligible for medicaid which would cover his medical costs for his hospitalization and for future medical treatment. The supervisor suggested that he take a leave of absence and he replied that he needed to be laid off in order to be eligible for aid per a conversation he had with a nurse. Could you please recommend the best way for us to address this? Thank you

0	What is considered best practice/customary when offering a terminated EE severance for two months? Are wages paid in a lump sum amount at the onset of the severance period, including any commissions that would be due, auto stipend. etc.? Or is an EE paid semi-monthly, per our regular pay schedule, throughout the severance period? Do employers typically allow PTO to continue accruing during the severance period, and pay out the balance of unused/accrued PTO time at the end of the severance period (9/1/17) or at the time of termination? Lastly, do you have a template that could be used to summarize the agreement, and how benefits are to be addressed? We are considering delaying the first day of COBRA to 9/1/17, aligning with the end of the severance period. In the meantime, would the EE remain active in our payroll system, or terminated? Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

I tried to call the facility it appears the doctor practices at but you can not reach anyone. What should I do?

4	Our Michigan office has a few college students doing an internship and they are paid interns. Unfortunately, one of them seems not to be a good fit and HR is receiving many complaints from employees. Although we have not recorded any tardiness and poor performance of this intern and have not officially disciplined her yet, but employees wants her to go now. Can we end her internship immediately without giving any reasons? It's an internship relationship, not employment relationship from our point of view, but since we are paying her, I wonder from the legal point of view, the court regards it as an employment relationship if we are sued by her.

4	employee hired on 5/30 went into labor and gave birth to a child on 7/3. Here are the clients questions: 1) can they terminate her since she is not even working there for more than 2 months? They cannot afford to keep her position open for the six weeks she is entitled too under NY State DBL. 2) It there intention is to terminate her, what should they do in order to ensure they are on sold footing. 3) she is still in the benefit eligibility waiting period (1st of the month following 60 days) so she is not eligible for company provided medical benefits. 4) Is there a state law "FMLA style" in place that would obligate the employer to provide coverage?	
5	We have an employee who has a threatening attitude towards other employees. Some employee's have not come into work claiming they are afraid of him. We would like to terminate him, but employee's have told me that he has PTSD. He has never disclosed anything about it or brought in a doctor's note. What is the risk in terminating him?	
6	We have an employee who is claiming that we are not allowed to deduct the loan amount from his final wages. Are his regular deductions considered part of the gross wages for the minimum wage purposes? His last paycheck was a net zero after all the deductions were taken out, could this be a problem? Could the employer be subject to waiting time penalties because his gross fell below minimum wage?	
5	We have an employee who request time off but his vacation request was not approved. He requested the time off through our online system, however, in addition to this his supervisor advised that unless he could get coverage for the time off requested, this was not approved. Even after reminders, he never followed up with his supervisor to confirm he got coverage, but then did not show up for work during the time off requested. We now consider this as being absent without approval, and consider it a no call no show. How should we notify the employee of this?	
5	Question about employee termination... We have an employee that has been out on workers comp for an extended amount of time, His restrictions were such that we could not provide modified duty. our works comp provider recently set him up to work in a return to work program that could accommodate his limitations. We have scheduled him to report 2 times now and he has not gone. The first time he just ignored it then said his daughter was visiting. The second time he claimed he was out of the state. We feel we have cause for termination for job abandonment but wanted to run it past you first. Thanks,

0	Hi - I received the following questions from a client and am hoping you can give guidance: "If we currently offer vacation and personal leave and we decide when an employee leaves that we do not want to pay that out can we do that as long as the employee manual states that or do we have to pay it out since they have accrued it? I know right now we do not pay out the personal leave and the handbook states that, but they are thinking about doing it for the vacation leave as well. Also if you can are you able to stipulate that they would not pay it out for salary employees, but will for hourly employees?" Thanks!

3	We have a repayment agreement in place for employees who receive a sign on bonus or relocation, etc. as part of their offer letter. The terms basically state that if they leave the company within a year or are fired for cause, they will need to repay the amount. But how can we go about doing this? Can we withhold from someone's paycheck and how much? What recourse does the company have if the employee just refuses to pay the money? Some of these bonus amounts are quite large so it wouldn't be feasible to only be able to withhold from someone's paycheck.	
1	We have an employee currently filling a full-time position that has on-going performance issues. These have been documented and we did have an opportunity to release from employment however did not. We would like to change this position to two part-time positions to perhaps push the employee to leave. Is this proper? Are there things we need to consider?

So is there a way we can put in a policy that we will hold them responsible for giving us advance notice or we can hold some amount from them to cover the cost of the training we do with them. Eventually it is costing the company time n money and all the departments run into chaos.

4	I received an email from one of our employees notifying me that effective today, she is resigning because she does not feel safe in the workplace. Her supervisor, who is also her friend, made a comment about the employee's mental capacity. It is known that the employee has a mental disability. The comment made its way up to our company president and the president, with a female witness present, discussed the matter with the supervisor. The employee is now upset, we believe, because the company president is now involved. The employee stated that she was not offended by the comment that her supervisor made, and now feels uncomfortable continuing to work here. How should we respond? The supervisor is on suspension for a completely unrelated matter.

(He had a seizure-no equipment was involved. He did hit his head on the pavement of the property though). I called in a worker's comp claim on Friday. The employee stayed in the hospital Thursday through Saturday, in the ICU. His manager went to visit him, and the employee gave his permission for his doctor to give the manager his diagnosis-cirrhosis of the liver due to drinking all and every day. We've had an idea that he'd been drinking at work a couple of times previously, but had no evidence, or real reason to start an investigation other than another employee saying they may have smelled it on him, and him leaving the work site for two hours to take a nap (in which he was written up for). This morning he wanted to come back to work, and said his doctor has cleared him, but has not shown us that documentation.

4	As a follow up to my previous issue the employee who sent the potentially abusive email has now sent out an email to the entire groups stating that two of her teammates are liars, and claiming multiple other inflammatory issues including acknowledging essentially being abusive. We feel that this along with her earlier behavior warrants dismissal, and I'd like to talk this through with someone.

Issues: 1.Injured driver took dog to work & rode along with new driver to train while on light duty, instead of training, played fetch with dog using injured shoulder (statement available). 2.Driver does not want to ride along with new drivers, did light duty jobs on his own unit, burned out pump on unit for 2nd time (expensive & major repairs, have 1st write-up from 1st time pump was burned out). 3.It has been discussed to release driver due to costly damages and continual improper handling of unit. We can continue to pay medical bills and therapy related to shoulder injury. Question: With 1st & 2nd write-up of pump being burned out, statement from another driver stating this employee did not fulfill his duties as requested, can we terminate on these grounds?	
0	What is the legal requirement in regards to timing of paying out an employee who terminates voluntarily or involuntarily from a company? Most specifically, how soon does a company need to pay out salary and accrued vacation/PTO time?	
2	I am creating a termination checklist for our company to use going forward. In looking over the checklist you have online, the below items were mentioned. Can you send me a sample of what these items should look like? State Unemployment forms/ pamphlets Termination letter Severance Agreement/Release of Claims, if applicable	
1	We took a big project in Missouri (we are in California). We had unexpected expenses for the implementation of this project. We brought in part-time employees to help. He wants to make layoffs in accounting and customer service. One employee in particular has carpal tunnel workers' compensation and goes to physical therapy. Can we lay this person off? "partnering people with knowledge" says we can if there is a financial hardship on the company. The employee is not leave.	
5	There is an employee who has given his two weeks notice, he will be intermittently working until the 21st. He will not come back to the office to perform work after today, we want to pay him today for the time through the 21st, whether he performs work after this or not. We are not terminating him, we are honoring his resignation, but is it allowable to pay him today through the final date, July 21st?	
3	Call relayed via Jasmine in sales at 9:15 am 7/11/17 Employee termination and they're resigning. Question about training a new employee. Please call EE resigned and had given two weeks notice but would like to let the person go early. Can I do this?	
4	We have an employee who advised our Administrator in May of impending retirement citing she will resign once her house has closed. Our owner wants to part ways now, and search for her replacement. Are there any issues in doing this?	
5	I have an employee who is a manager that has been here less than a year and his supervisor wants to let him go due to his attitude. They want to terminate him and he is in Texas. There was a lot of verbal communication but nothing was documented. He is under a protected class (he is from India he has brown skin). I want them to provide enough documentation. What if we offer him two weeks of severance pay? Is there a severance agreement that will remove him from he filing an EEO complaint? . Is there a severance agreement template that you can provide? He is over the age of 40.	
5	I have an employee they want to terminate him. He is in CA. I have documentation, counseling form. He was probation for 2 days because of performance. Am I okay to terminate him? Under 40. Ethnicity is 2 or more races.	
6	We had an employee who we let go last week due to attendance - he has an outstanding loan. Can we deduct what is owed from his final paycheck?	
3	We have a sales coordinator who was asked by another employee about a family rate to stay at the hotel. our handbook states that employee rooms have to be booked online however the sales coordinator told the other employee that rate would be $150, the employee understood it as $150 for the entire not a night. Sales coordinator never mentioned that to her supervisor or anyone but she technically did not book an employee rate of $39 a night. Now the employee's family is very upset because they got charged $150 a night when they were promised $150 for the entire stay. Since the Sales coordinator violated how the employee rate was booked is this grounds for termination with no approval.	
5	TRIPLE FRESH - PA GROUP - FEDERAL COBRA Good afternoon, The above group has the following question: We have an EE who is salary + overtime. We are looking at laying him off due to poor sales. We would like to change him to hourly so we can use him a few hours each week to help make up the difference between his unemployment and his salary. The idea is that he can use the time in a sales capacity to help build sales with the goal of having enough to bring him back full time. He has questioned this though, essentially suggesting that changing his status would open us up to litigation. My thought is he is non-exempt (he still gets OT), and while his job includes managerial duties, this fact does not change the fact that he can be laid off. I await your reply. Thanks. Best regards, Lisa L. Reed Due to overall company drop in sales/revenue, there is a lack of work in catering, where this employee works. There are other managers, but not in his area. There was a Director until January, but that person left. At this time, we divided his position into two and gave part of the job to Catering Sales and the other to Catering Operations. This layoff is the operations manager, so until the sales improve, there is nothing to operate. We would reduce his hours to part time until/unless the business picks up.	
4	We are a medical group located in MD, DC and VA. One of our employees in VA has had poor attendance since last year. She was written up in 9/26 & 11/4/2016 (suspended in November), spoke to her again in December, and then again given a written warning on 3/3/2017. On the March write up, her manager told her that any tardiness can lead to termination. For the last two weeks she has come in late and her lunch breaks are longer than the time allotted. We plan to terminate her. Please email me or call me to review this issue. Thank you.	
1	We are looking at a RIF and layoffs. We will need to terminate approx. 30 employees due to reduction in force. What kind of notice are we required to provide? Do we have to pay out vacation? Do we have to offer severance pay?	
4	We have an employee who was terminated from our company last Friday. She called and said she wanted her paycheck and that in TN, the final pay laws says she needs to be paid within 72 hours.	
2	Wanted to review the wording for the documentation we will be providing an employee upon termination. We want to state the termination is for misconduct based on the improper use of a company credit card.	
2	Do you have an example certified letter that we can send to an employee who quit who took our company laptop requesting it's return?	
2	I'm completing a termination form and wanted to run the reason by you. Basically the employee misused the company credit card several times and she's admitted to it. I was thinking of writing in 'lack of trust' and misuse of credit card. What do you suggest?	
2	When an employee quits and they took the company laptop. 1. What are the ways to get the company equipment back? 2. Are we able to hold their final check until they return the equipment? 3. If they were caught stealing and we have identified the amount are we legally able to take that amount out of their last paycheck? _____ Our Response: You are not able to hold pay, this could be a wage and hour violation, so take other legal remedies to collect company equipment. You reference that the employee was caught stealing. If you have video surveillance or a witness to the situation or a confession signed by the employee, you may file a police report and take legal action to seek recovery of any theft. Otherwise, without the ability to provide proof of theft, it is best addressed with filing a loss to the business, as you could be held liable for defamation of character when there is an inability to prove theft. I recommend you seek recovery with legal support and or small claims. We'd appreciate your feedback. Please take a moment to tell us how we did: Click here to begin.

4	With Michael Smith: We're going to tell the employees tomorrow about the location closure and close the location at the end of the month. We are going to offer these 2 employees a position at another office. One of these employees is problematic and we should have dealt with her before now. I feel like we have to bring her along. What if these employees decline the job(s). If the employee doesn't want to go and we say this is all we have and tell her to resign will she get UI? We try to avoid paying UI. The manager is white and she is a minority. We have had issues with her. I am hesitant to offer one a job and lay her off without write ups...? I do not know if we have jobs posted elsewhere or not.	
1	We are terminating an employee today and would like a checklist and information for guidance.	
3	Follow up question regarding the waiting time penalty that a former employee is stating we owe. The employee resigned on 12/21 with no advanced notice.	
4	We have an employee that was arrested over the weekend and is being held in jail. She was arrested for a prior conviction of issuing a worthless check which is being classified as a Felony charge. This is not the first time she has been arrested in the last two months, the other was driving on a suspended license and again was in jail. She is currently being held with no bond but is due to go to court January 3rd. She works in our accounting department, so this is obviously a concern. Our Handbook states we have no tolerance for Criminal Convictions. It also states that our Standards of Conduct in and out of the workplace are always to be a standard level of performance. Our handbook also states that Immediate Termination can result due to Violation of Law. In your estimation are we okay to terminate this employee?	
3	A group has 12 employees. One of the employees went out on WC leave in Oct. The WC carrier investigated and found the claim to be fraudulent. Can they term the EE? Can they retroactively term the group health benefits? Could he receive state COBRA?	
1	We have an employee terminating (Illinois location) and wants to give 2 weeks notice and then take the remaining 3 weeks of his vested vacation. I assume he wants to do this to stay on benefits. What can we do in the situation? Thanks!	
0	An employee that is fired or quits - are they entitled to vacation under California law?	
1	Our business is planning lay off about 45 employees of the 165 throughout all our locations in CA and NC. We do not think this will amount to 33% in any one of our locations, so we will not be required to give the employees 60 days notice. I would like to know if there are any other notice requirements besides the WARN Act. Or do we need to report this to any governing board? Also, what laws come into play in terms of Unemployment. Will we be held responsible to cover the unemployment costs through the state?	
4	We have an employee who started last April. She had to take leave in August for emergency surgery. We allowed her the time off even though she was not yet eligible for FMLA, and she was able to get STD. She returned in October, but subsequently has been having performance issues, not following instruction, and refusing to attend mandatory meetings. We have decided to terminate.	
5	We had hired a DM in August on salaried position. We promised him 2 weeks leave when we hired him but due to complaints from fellow female employees, we had to let him go. He is asking for his leave pay. Do you know what's the MD law? Are we supposed to just pay him prorated or full 2 weeks?	
2	As a follow up to our earlier conversation regarding the termination of an employee for performance issues, what should we state is the reason for the termination?	
4	Brenda Carpenter, Durant Health Care Call back: 920.494.7344 We have an employee with an ongoing attendance issue. She recently applied for FMLA due to a serious health condition, and certification states intermittently leave frequency of two days a month. She has already used her two days this month, and called in due to another illness on 12/27. She also called in again on 12/30, stating she was using a vacation day (that was not pre-approved). Are there any concerns in processing termination?	
3	Can an employer just not show up to an unemployment hearing	
1	We had an employee that got arrested. How can we proceed? Can we terminate?	
5	We had to terminate some team members before the end of the year. One was in another state, he hasnt returned his equipment and one expense report, and he hasnt signed his general release agreement. He is requesting a copy of our employee handbook. We want to talk about the situation.	
0	Our vacation pay out policy states that employees must give 30 days notice to receive their unused vacation pay at the end of employment. Shorter notice will result in prorated payout of vacation, and termination by the employer may result in loss of all vacation. We have an employee who quit with no notice; can you confirm that we are not required to pay out her unused vacation?	
4	An employee that was recently terminated called and asked for a termination letter. She was terminated for gross misconduct. Can you think of a reason why we would not supply her with this information? Is there anything we need to avoid?	
4	I have an employee that has been with us 9 months. She has had a lot of attendance issues and makes a lot of errors in her work. She is now requesting a medical leave for 8 weeks. I would like to terminate the employee based on both her attendance and work errors. Are there legal liabilities since she has medical problems?	
3	an employee was caught stealing money out of the cash register on viewing the security camera videos. How do we approach the employee? What is our legal stance on terminating this employee or seeking reimbursement?	
4	I have an employee who we are contemplating dismissing due to a lack of performance and it is a sales position and they are not meeting their numbers. The beginning of last week she had some health issues and she was instructed not to speak at all and she is having another procedure on the 16th. I want to make sure that we are handling this correctly. She has been with the company about two years and the numbers in general have not been great and In Sept we talked about poor performance and we had her develop a plan to improve. I do not have an email regarding this conversation; but, have the plan. Nothing was documented. She was last in sales in Sept, October and November.	
0	We have a situation where we wanted to terminate an employee for sexual harassment. We gave him the option of termination or resignation after, we suspended him without pay for a few days. He is asking about his vacation payout. Our policy states that employees are not entitled to this payout if they leave on bad terms, or if they do not provide adequate notice when resigning, Do we need to pay this vacation time out? Is this allowed in Oregon?	
2	My question is in the state of CA can we impose a temporary work furlough due to lack of production in our business unpaid, 2-3 weeks.	
3	A group is terminating employment with one of the companies and providing employment with same terms and conditions with the other company. If an employee refuses to accept the other employment, would she be eligible for UI benefits? Please send the CA HIPP Notice.	
5	We have an employee that requested Christmas weekend off. We accommodated his request. Then he came back after and said he decided not to go on his trip for Christmas but instead for New Years. He was told it was too late to accommodate his request and he needed to be at work. He then called off for 3 days over the New Years weekend and said he was in San Diego. We let him know that he did not have approval to take the time off and if he was sick for 3 days he would need to bring in a doctors note. He then said he was needed in San Diego to care for a sick family member. He was then asked to get a note from a doctor indicating the need for him to be there to care for the family member. If he does not have this could we consider this a resignation?	
4	We opened a new store in MD on 11/12/16. We talked with a friend about coming to work as a manager. Before the shop opened they sent out flyers, and we compensated them for this pre-work. When the shop opened they come on as a manager. We started having problems with this manager right away. It was clear she wasn't happy and had several melt downs. On 12/23 she text, she was not opening shop at 9:00 am as required and instead she was coming at 1:00 pm with all employees to have a meeting regarding all the concerns. I brought her into office, and talked to her. She claims there is a franchise agreement that prohibits a stylist to be alone in the shop for 4 hours. I cancelled the meeting, and she quit. She tried to get all the other employees to leave too, none of them left. After a week she texted to pick up belongings. She got all her stuff on Saturday and acted very professional. Yesterday she texts is there any way I can be a part time stylist? Today have you guys discussed any way I can be a PT stylist? How do I get her to stop texting me?	
2	Arizona branch - going over the termination packets with the manager there and he mentioned the HIPP notice talks about California. I thought AZ also had the HIPP program..	
3	We had two employees approach us that they have been having an affair for several months and one of them is married. There is nothing in our policy that you cannot fraternize in the workplace. Everyone has noticed somethings going on. I took the Senior of the two back in December and let them know that the others were complaining about their behavior and it was disruptive to the rest of the office. She left it with consider it done and it stopped. The partners want to let one of them go. One of hem has had job performance issues and they want to terminate them?	
6	An employee was witnessed by our video surveillance stealing money from our deposit. We confirmed that the deposit was short. May we take the money from her final paycheck? May we press charges?	
1	If an employee gives two week notice and says that 12/31 is the termination date, we have received everything back from him and want to pay the final check, can we wait until the next pay period to pay this out? We had two sales employees resign. Because they went to a competitor, we told them we did not need them to stay on for the balance of the two weeks, and dismissed them. They are asking about their pay for the two weeks' notice. Are we required to pay this?	
2	We are changing an employee from a W-2 employee to an IC. Does she need to receive termination paperwork?	
3	Employee failed drug test, we put them on probation. We asked them to take a followup test, and they refused stating they knew it would come up positive. So, we went ahead and terminated them. On term letter there is no mention of the reason for termination on your sample term letter. Should I put the reason for termination on the letter?	
2	Can you please provide severance information?	
3	The question is regarding an employee that stole money from the safe.	
2	I was wondering if UST think has a sample termination letter. I did not see one.	
4	An employee had a non-work injury and reduced her hours to part-time earlier this year. Around March she said she couldn't work at all. We allowed her time off but she did not formally request leave or mention FMLA. She was not eligible for FMLA due to her hire date. She has been on leave since March. We received a notice of claim filed from the unemployment department. How should I respond?	
1	As a follow up to my last question, we have an employee who has been incarcerated for 2 weeks. We have determined that he will most likely not be returning to work. How can we best proceed with termination at this point?	
3	An employee resigned and sent us an email for her reason for resignation. There are no accusations or allegations of anything wrong, or confidential information, but I just want to confirm that there would be no violations if we shared this with the employee's manager's manager. Thoughts?	
6	If an employer issues a final check to a California employee late, do we need to include a late penalty per day?	
5	I have an employee who is a manager that has been here less than a year and his supervisor wants to let him go due to his attitude. They want to terminate him and he is in Texas. There was a lot of verbal communication but nothing was documented. He is under a protected class (he is from India he has brown skin). I want them to provide enough documentation. What if we offer him two weeks of severance pay? Is there a severance agreement that will remove him from he filing an EEO complaint? . Is there a severance agreement template that you can provide? He is over the age of 40.	
4	We hired a CNA about 2 weeks ago. We discussed the job duties with her during the interview. Now she presented us with a doctor's note indicating that she cannot lift more than 10 lbs. Lifting more than 10 lbs is an essential job function. We have no other positions available to accommodate her. May we let her go?	
4	We have an employee who has been charged with serious felony charges, but the case could drag out over a long period of time. She is currently PRN status for scheduling. How do we go about terming her employment without it coming back on us? Do we just not let her pick up any hours so once she goes 30 days without working we term her for that reason? Or can we term her now knowing she has been charged with these felony charges? If we do term her now can she come back on as for something for terming her? She was arrested and taken into jail in May. We knew because she let the scheduler know she wouldn't be in to work shifts. She told her there were no charges against her and we let her work after getting out on bond. Then yesterday a deputy came in and told us she had been formally charged. They are two Class A felonies. There was a meeting with the employee yesterday and she is on a suspension. They are drug related charges - possession and distribution, evading tax. She has been very open regarding the charges.	
3	PA Employer wishes to terminate employee during 90 day introductory period. Employee Handbook does not reference termination during period. Only that period may be extended. Can employee be terminated for poor performance immediately? Or must we counsel employee?	
6	In reference to an exempt employee's final pay, if their final day is mid week , do we have to pay them for the full week?	
0	Do employees need to be paid for unused PTO upon termination or if insufficient notice is given under Minnesota Law?	
3	If an employee gives two weeks notice and then states that they are not going to work through the full notice during the second part of the notice, when does the 72-hours start? I spoke with someone from the DLSE and they stated that the 72-hours had already been exhausted during the first 72-hours of the notice period and that we would have to provide the employee with their check immediately. Is that correct?	
1	This is part of a restructuring and we will be hiring a new CTO who will be doing a skills analysis to determine who will be a fit and who will not be. Some will be laid off. Is there a specific way to go about this?	
6	When I pay an exempt employee in the final workweek and am figuring out the hourly equivalent of their salary, do I divide the annual salary by 2080 hours and use that rate? Or do I use the semi-monthly salary divided by the number of hours? The second way gets a lower number.	
5	We found out this morning that one of our employees has passed away. We have life insurance, but he didnt fill out the beneficiary form, we will handle that with the carrier. He cancelled his direct deposit so we have to issue him a final paycheck. He had been a no call no show for a couple of days. We went to retrieve our company vehicle and law enforcement and a family member was there. We have not been officially notified yet by his family. To whom do we make the check payable?	
5	We have an employee who we want to terminate. He is an apprentice. We feel he is accident prone. He has been in 4 vehicle accidents outside of work; the latest resulting of having his pinky severed and reattached. He doesn't operate a company truck. Employee provided a doctor's note advising that that he is going to see the doctor at the end of the week.	
6	Rachel Li, HR Coordinator called. Rose and Jack are no longer at Agiltron. If an employee owes the company money, is it legal to deduct from their final paycheck? The employee signed a relocation and legal fee agreement that if she resigned within two years, she would repay the full relocation and legal fee expenses.	
0	Do we have to pay out vacation upon termination?	
6	A Florida worker passed away and relatives can't cash his last payroll check. Can the deceased's last payroll check be re-printed to someone else?	
4	We have a employee who file EEOC claim against us. She was offered a transfer to another location and she refused it. Now she turned in her two weeks notice. If she changes her mind and says she still wants her job, can we say no you turned in your 2 weeks notice?	
5	Someone is on an H1B and it will be expiring soon. We are likely going to make the decision not to renew it. I believe he has 10 days to find a new employer to sponsor him or he needs to leave the country. Do we need any documentation on his performance if we choose not to renew the visa ir can the expiration of the visa be reason enough to not consider renewal? This is part of a larger restructuring and the CTO will be doing skills analysis to determine who will no longer be a fit.	
5	I have an employee that has been out off and on for over a couple years on FMLA. His performance has been marginal and we have want to terminate him, but haven't due to his medical condition. We believe he senses that he is on the hot seat with us. He recently was caught using our internet and computer equipment trying to view pornography sites. We have in our employee handbook a section titled Rules of Conduct and Personal Responsibility. Under that section is a bullet point stating: SAS Internet or email accounts should be used solely for company purposes and employees should be aware that such use is NOT private and may be monitored. Are we opening ourselves up to litigation if we terminate for this violation?	
6	I will be terminating 3 employees and would like to discuss each scenario for potential risk. Also, when are final checks due? Are there any state forms I must provide? When are final commissions due?	
0	If an employer has only sick time, does that have to be paid out to employees' upon termination?	
6	We have an employee in VA who terminated. When are we required to pay out his final pay?	
2	Termination of an employee over the age of 40 - Are there any age specific things I need to put in the termination letter? There is no severance being offered.	
4	We have an employee (150 in CA) who started on 6/28/17 and per the supervisor she is not working out. The supervisor said she is not retaining information and has made several mistakes. I explained that there is a learning curve and some employees take longer than others. However, the manager said that she received a complaint from another employee that the new hire used profanity and called the other employee a profane word. Another employee overheard the conversation. Can we terminate?	
1	By the end of the year we are looking to close down part of the operations. We are shutting down because we are opening an operation in Texas that will house part of our production department. We aren't sure how many people will be impacted yet; it might be less than 50 (we have about 200 people in product total). In looking at the Cal-Warn Act it talks about being triggered if there is a plant closing, a mass layoff, or a relocation. We understand the first two items but aren't sure what "relocation" means. We are relocating a portion of the business but it is one department at our employment site, not the whole site. If less than 50 people are affected would this still trigger Cal-WARN? Really, we need to understand how "relocation" is defined in this context and whether it is a relocation in conjunction with a plant closing or mass layoff or if it stands alone.	
4	A new employee has been taking a lot of time off during her 90-days waiting period for sick/vacation pay. We have approved the time off but have not docked her pay. If she separates from employment before she earns accruals, can we recover the payment from her final wages?	
4	An employee was hired in April. She has made several mistakes in her work, lack of detail causing errors, and was not providing the high level of customer service we expect. We counseled her in the past, with no success. We were going to let her go Friday afternoon, but she left work early on Friday without authorization, then called us to say that she is in CA caring for her mom who had a stroke. How should we manage?	
3	What is called when a manager, who has turned in their notice (6-weeks in advance), notifies the team of their departure without permission and then didn't tell anyone? This has caused much hardship for both the company and employees since it was announced outside the plan. We would like to terminate her prior to the resignation date based on this. It's not insubordination exactly, but it came back through an employee who as upset about their department closing since the manager is leaving and not being replaced.	
1	We have an employee that has been on leave and we have decided to terminate him. Should we term him employment in the system?	
5	We are a contractor at a site where the general contractor requires drug testing for all our employees. Our employees were tested today. For one employee, his first test was rejected because he had with him hand warmers and rubber bands (items needed to keep urine warm). his second sample was insufficient to test and he has refused a third test. Can we terminate him even though we have not gotten a positive drug test from him?	
5	We have an employee who has quit working with us. He has some PTO that we owe to him. He has a child support order, and we would also like to deduct for the premiums for the full month. If we do this, he will not have enough to cover everything. Can we reduce the amount for the child support order?	
2	How to write a termination email to an employee in Houston?

5	We have an employee who had provided two weeks notice and he's asked off for time to look for other employment during that time. He is a exempt employee and we'd really like to let him go before that 2 weeks. If we do that do we risk that termination becoming involuntary.	
3	Hi, Headquarter located in NV, and the employee is located in CA. Is there any regulation that protects employee not to get terminated earlier than requested resignation date? The employment contract type is at will. Example: Employee submits a notification of resignation to the employer 30 days in advance. The employer would like to terminate this employee in 15 days as they found a new replacement. Also, Can this employee at least file for unemployment?	
6	I have a deceased employee in Illinois. We need to pay final wages and commission, and final expenses to his spouse. If she provides and will and a letter stating she is the legal representative and includes directions for method of payment, is that within the law. Also, is there a timeframe in Illinois that this payment must be made or does it depend on when we receive her paper work?	
4	An employee has been under a performance improvement plan.

3	Matt (broker) on line..he is with the client. Husband and wife worked for employer. The wife notified employer that her husband resigned (in a text as he does not speak English). Subsequent to the husband's termination the wife, who worked on an as needed basis, was not called into work by the employer since the employer assumed that she would not work for the company without her husband being employed as well. The employer would like to close the employment record for the wife and has already done so for the husband. There is no final pay involved. How should the employer handle?	
5	It involves an employee who was injured on the job (workers comp), and has now returned to work. (was out for quite some time) The issue is that the employee was not really meeting their job description and goals prior to the injury, however I don't believe that was discussed with him, and now we feel we need to move on and replace him. We don't know if there are legal implications for doing this.....	
1	We had an employee who we terminated in June 28th. He just returned his severance agreement today. We have already just ran payroll. Do we have to cut a manual check for this, or can we wait until the next pay period?

1	We have three employees we will soon be terminating. This year we had investors buy into our company. They have been reviewing reports and trying to help with profits and bottom-line. They looked to see which positions are not needed, who is being paid too much, etc. That's the info I got. Here are the three individuals we are considering and why: 1. Been here 14 years, highest paid employee ($72k), 42 years old. Wife works here too. We are offering severance including two weeks per year worked and have the standard letter with the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act language. Owner wants to give him notice first. The position is more of a luxury offering to customers, teaches them how to use products, etc. 2. Male, 44 years old, 1 yr 9 months service, paid base + commission. Showroom sales manager position. Over the course of employment has had several performance issues, management style can't resolve conflict within the group. His boss left at beginning of year, and the position was given to someone else. He has been coasting for the rest of year. Not a fit. Another showroom manager, female similar age, in another location will also take on this role. 3. She is 29, been here 1 yr 6 months, hourly employee. Department is overstaffed and she was the last to be hired. However, the department manager wants to tell her we would consider contract work as needed. No performance problems. Director of Marketing came in today, said she needed to move forward with the terminations of 2 & 3. Can we do these at separate times? Should they be considered layoff? Do we have to give #3 a release agreement? What is the best way to announce this?	
3	It has to do with the WARN act for layoffs. We had some layoffs in March and April and they were keeping it under the number for giving the 60 day notice. They are considering doing more layoffs. Is there a waiting period between layoffs? What is the time?	
4	I have a current staff member who has now had couple of incidents where she hit her head while working due to negligence on her part. This has been filed as a workman's comp claim both times which is costing the company money. Am I able to terminate her if this persists and at what point can I let her go due to her inability to manage her surroundings while at work? Thank you.	
3	2. I have called about the owner of company, comes in and yells at someone. I've decided I'm going to give notice. I was going to offer my manager that I will help him find someone, train, and transition. In consideration of that I want to be laid off so I can get unemployment. Is that legal?	
5	We have an employee who is a CDL driver. He's was been having health issues, and is too dizzy to drive. We've been going through the interactive process with him and he's only able to be on a leave. We's currently only an FMLA leave through 7/14, his doctor has referred him to a specialist for a mental health referral, but has provided us with not date to extend the leave. We would like to terminate his employment as he is unable to perform the essential functions of his job.	
5	We have an employee who injured himself during off hours. He provided medical certification with restrictions. If we can accommodate but he's not following his doctor's orders, can we discipline?	
6	We have an employee who we gave a verbal 30 day notice to terminate his employment. He works remotely and has a company laptop. Are we allowed to withhold the cost of a replacement laptop from his final paycheck or hold his final paycheck? The company is located in Michigan and he lives in Pennsylvania. Are there federal/state laws that prohibit us from recouping this equipment or the replacement cost for the laptop?	
6	via phone: We had an employee at our GA location pass away. I know from a Federal side how to handle. I need to know how to handle the final wages for the state of GA as far as taxation goes. I would also need guidance on who the final pay should to go, and what documentation they may need it any.	
5	An employee aggravated a herniated disk on the job. Workers compensation carrier and doctor returned him to work with modified duty and doctor restrictions. yet he doesn't seem willing to do the work. For example; The employee may be asked to use the forklift around the construction yard within the doctors restrictions - but suggests he cant due to medications yet is able to use his vehicle to travel to and from work. Additionally; the employee contends he cannot perform task requiring physical labor within the doctors restrictions yet was observed jumping over a puddle to access his vehicle a motion not likely advisable given his injury and even performing work at another unrelated employer. With frequent objections by the employee to perform work related requests within the doctors restrictions at what point can he be terminated? Please advise.	
4	An employee in our Canada office has give her resignation for Jan. 20th 2017. We would like to make this Friday Jan. 06 2017 her last day? Is this possible do we have to pay out any additional work weeks per Canada Employment Law.	
5	An employee is being charged with domestic violence (strangulation and assault) of his girlfriend. He does apartment maintenance and resides on our property in one of our apartments. Can we terminate because he was arrested and due to the potential to hurt someone during work hours? We have a 1-day no call/no show policy. He was out and didn't call in yesterday. Can we terminate for that reason?	
0	We are an Illinois employer and offer time off benefits in the forms of separate Vacation, Sick, and Personal days. Sick days obviously are reserved for illness, while Vacation and Personal time may be used for any reason. The only additional restriction placed on Personal days are that the time off approval is subject to manager discretion and department needs. Does IL law require that we pay out both unused Vacation and Personal time upon an employee's termination?	
5	We have an employee that has been missing work and today I found out that he had to report to jail for something, and he is out on a work release. He came in yesterday for 45 minutes and left and did not say anything. He is missing too much work and call out a lot. Can we terminate him?	
4	An employee who is the Payroll Specialist in the HR Dept., returned from FMLA/CFRA on December 5th. She had taken five months off for the birth of her child. Upon her return she only wanted to work four days a week. We held her position open for her and I explained that her position is a full time, salaried, exempt position. I offered that we could change her position to hourly so she could work four days a week but she did not want the loss of income from only working four days a week, she wanted to continue to draw her full salary. It is obvious in her performance and attitude that she does not want to return to her usual and customary position. She took the last week of December off and the day after she returned to the office filed a WC claim for stress and anxiety. Can I terminate her at this point without legal repercussions? She has only shown up for work a handful of days in December and is not doing her job to satisfaction. She has already been given a verbal warning.	
3	An employee's spouse was hired for a job about 2 hours away. The employee has requested to continue employment by working from home. However, the executives have decided that this is not a possibility as they are trying to create a cohesive environment having everyone in the same office space. We will let him know today. What questions can be asked about his relocation?	
4	I believe I have a job abandonment issue. We have an employee who has not shown up to work. She hasn't been in since 11/29. Tuesday and Wednesday we have not seen her. Friday and Monday were holidays. Messages have been left and she has not returned calls. She cleared out her desk as well. What do I need to do? We do not currently have a job abandonment policy.

What questions can be asked about his relocation? Follow Up: I am trying to determine if HR needs to be present in the meeting, as we have concluded we cannot permit the telework.	
4	We terminated an employee yesterday and gave her a severance agreement. She has signed it and returned it. Under the New York law, if an employee receives a check and then deposits it, determines the act of waiving her rights under the severance agreement. However, the employer is direct depositing her check, does a direct deposit constitute the same waiving rights as a physical deposit?	
1	How do we legally lay off an older employee?

1	We have an employee out on leave since December 13th. We have laid off the employee's at that location. Do we have to keep him through the FMLA? Can we offer him severance? Can we take the COBRA premiums out of his severance?	
5	I had an employee placed on a leave due to an investigation into an incident. The incident was founded and we terminated the employee over the phone. After that, he was unresponsive to any information given to him. A termination letter and his final check were sent to him within the three-day mark to his home address on file. It has been over 2 weeks now and he just called saying he never got anything and when relaying the address to him he said he forgot to put the apt number on it when he did his original paperwork. Are we liable because he didn't get his check within 3 days?	
2	Can you provide information on layoffs? We would appreciate any supporting information around layoffs that may be helpful.	
3	Hello, Can I terminate a pregnant employee that has a history of absence and was counseled about it as any other employee? This employee is not eligible for FMLA yet, but will on 1/11/17. This employee was release by the doctor to be out of work until giving birth. This employee does not have any available vacation nor sick time available. Please let me know your thoughts! Thank you	
1	We have an employee who we suspect will be extending their resignation as a month or so ago the employees manager indicated he and his subordinate were engaging in a possible relationship. This is against our company policy. Is there anything we need to ask in the meeting to limit liability for a possible harassment or coerced termination claim?	
2	Can you send me your final pay whitepaper?	
0	We had a remote employee in Florida resign. Our policy says unused vacation is not paid out unless the employee is here more than a year. I want to make sure that is allowable in Florida.	
5	We hired a former volunteer this year after he turned 18. He has been demanding about getting better pay and a better position; he wants a position that has not yet even been posted. Recently he sent a threatening email to a dept. director which threatened the program director and her husband. The company wants to terminate this employee for violation of the workplace violence policy.	
1	We have an employee who resigned the date we expected her to return from Maternity Leave. Are there any special notices required at time of separation?	
1	For the WARN act, at what point would we be following the CA guidelines and the federal guidelines? We have companies across the US and I just want to make sure I am following the correct guidelines.	
4	We have an employee who has repeatedly had issue. First she was not following the company dress code, then we received complaints about her from our agents, she also has had several issues with her colleges and lastly, we believe that she is falsifying her time card. She states that she's here at 7:00 am, but on several occasions the morning supervisor has seen her come in later. If the termination is not strictly performance, what can we say during the termination meeting?

2	The company discontinued a intern position within the company because of a company reorganization. This is a part time position. Should you provide a letter of termination to the intern?	
4	An employee went out on maternity leave end of November she came in last week and told me she was not coming back to work. She had 46 sick days that she could use and that would put her getting paid thru early February. If we typically do not pay terminated employees sick time, would you recommend we only pay up until the day she informed us of her plans?	
4	We have an employee who could not fulfill the essential functions of her job after STD leave of absence ended. Her LTD claim is pending. We offered to her and she accepted a temporary part-time position which is to end on January 15. During this time we had to restructure the department to continue without a manager and found that the position (which she previously held) was no longer necessary or efficient within our client service model. The employee has now indicated that she would like to return full-time with accommodations for her disability. We are working to determine our staffing needs in her department and plan to create a job description for a new position if one is warranted. Are we obligated to offer the position to her if she cannot fulfill the essential functions of the job? We do not have any other open positions at this time, and I assume we are not obligated to create a new position for her if there is no business case to do so?	
1	Can we terminate via phone?	
5	We have an employee that said he was leaving (I do not know all the particulars of this). In his resignation, given on 12/27/16, he said his last day would be January 6, 2017. He basically has been unreachable with projects that were still in his care. Several management and co-employees have tried contacting him several times via email, texting, and calling with only a couple of responses. I have sent him forms to fill out for payroll and those have not been returned. It seems he has not fulfilled the duties of his position in the last two weeks. Client projects have become delinquent which is of the greatest concern. With that little bit of background, some of the questions we have are: Is this considered job abandonment? Does he qualify for COBRA, vacation/PTO pay if it is? Are there forms that need to be filled out indicating this? Handbook says with 2 weeks notice, PTO will be paid but he has not fulfilled his obligations in those two weeks so are we still required to pay this?

2	Please send sample verbiage for termination and announcement of departures.	
1	We have a video of an employee getting a bunch of plastic wrap putting it into a ball and tossing it. The manager recorded it. I was looking in the handbook and I didn't see horseplay in there. What should we call this termination?

NJC Hired another driver who has been driving for a short period of time. NJC hired this new driver without reviewing the Motor Vehicle Reports.

That also didn't work out, he was making mistakes and was careless. We moved him to another position. Now he is in a role where he has little responsibility and just has to put things away. I've gotten reports that he is continually making mistakes. This morning it was brought to my attention that he was also bad mouthing the company. The supervisor spoke to him about this issue and about the carelessness in his work and explained that the last change was a last attempt.

And out of all of those 116 are part-time and 147 are full time. We don't know if this is considered a plant closing or a mass layoff.	
4	Question from client: Recently the employees daughter reached out to Deborah and said her Mother (our Employee) was in Jail. This is due to prior unfortunate circumstances that the employee thought she had resolved. The employee will stand before a judge again on Monday the 17th, at that time they will decide whether she will stay in Jail longer or be released. This is all just according to the employees daughter. How do we handle a situation like this in order to be in compliance? Do we put her job on hold until the 17th or longer? Do we reach out to our contact (Melissas Daughter) after the 17th and see if the employee is returning to work?

1	In our Delaware office the warehouse/logistics department it has been slowing down and we have less business. We have been considering cutting down on the workforce. We have one employee working there who was reportedly taking our company truck to go buy drugs, etc. He acted shocked, embarrassed and said it didnt happen. The partner is the one who reported the issue about him. The person who was accused of the situation, is one of the employees we would like to let go as well as another person. We have two specific positions that may be affected, with two employees in each position. One person from each position would be downsized. The individual who was accused/approached is one of the employees who would be let go. We want to discuss our risks.	
3	Im at a client site, and they have an employee who has been here 15 years who is not performing well. They want to let him go. If they offer him compensation, what should they call it? This would be a termination for performance, not a layoff. The new manager is complaining about this employees work. He is a painter, and not doing a great job. The manager has been here two months and has written him up. Typically, for separation packages the company gives people one week for every year of employment. They dont want to do that in this case. Recently, they also let go another man who was part time and also over 65.	
4	I have an employee who resigned. She was a salaried employee. She did accrue PTO but in our policy we do not have to pay it out. June 26 was the last day of the pay period. June 23rd was her resignation date.

5	Amy-stellar employee's performance plummetd over last 3 mo. Dist.Mgr/VP did performance APR-employee admitted to failure to perform.Also indicated personal issues/depression with no detail, but had a melt-down in front of DM.

I was overturned on that-the needs of the business won't allow that much time. The rep has a "hot"territory and we need a capable person to cover it. Just checking to make sure no interference with Med Leave (we have <50 emp) or wrongful termination.

4	We terminated an employee for an excess of negative guest complaints. They all came in within a short time span. Additionally, we had some executives at the restaurant who observed this employee and wanted to terminate immediately without knowledge of the customer complaints. The employee was terminated and soon after called in complaining that she had been treating unfairly but in her email referenced her thoughts on how a coworker, not here, have been treated differently with negative guest complaint online. we contacted the person's office with additional complaints of this individual. I'd like to discuss the situation further with you and see what you think of the approach I took.

1	We have a need to reduce positions within the company due to economic reasons. Our policy is to take into account the employee's seniority and productivity when determining who will be affected by the layoff. For one such situation, we have identified an individual that management wants to lay off due to his productivity, however, he is not the most recently hired, and there is no backup to support there are performance issues with this employee. What is the risk to the employer in this circumstance? Can we still lay him off?	
1	We have an employee who is continuously showing up to work appearing to be under the influence. We have had customer complaints. We are an at will state, so we know we can term her for no reason. Do we just say that we are terminating her because it wasn't working out, or what reason do we give?	
2	Can you send me information on termination paperwork for California?	
1	We are considering doing a RIF at work due to a restructure. What are the guidelines around that? Are there any best practices?	
2	Can you please provide information about severance agreements and releases? Also, if there are requirements for employees affected who are over age 40, please include that as well.	
5	An employee was hired recently and worked only 2 days. He came back on the third day and said that his knees could not take the standing all day and he left. He has not returned since. We have no other positions to offer him. How should we manage?	
1	We had a bus driver who transports children to a local school strike a child. The school will most assuredly be reporting the incident to CPS. The employee is off today. Are we able to suspend her pending investigation while we determine if we can proceed with termination?	
5	We terminated someone earlier, and I kind of noticed when I was putting together the paystub. The sick pay was showing a balance still. He also said we owed him 14 hours of sick time.	
1	We have an employee who has been terminated for over a month and has not returned our company computer, phone and headset. We have tried contacting multiple times and have not heard back. What can we do about this situation?	
2	Can you please send information about the WARN act? We are considering a layoff/rif and need to know if it applies.	
4	We are a small company and need to downsize a bit. One of the people we were going to layoff has been out on leave due to a surgery. This employee has been here many years, she is probably eligible for Medicare. We need to eliminate some jobs and restructure, but we are getting complaints about this person and her performance. She is the person who corrects other people's mistakes, but she is making her own mistakes and not doing a good job of correcting hers or others' mistakes. So she is one person we would want to layoff. She will be returning to work from her leave soon and we want to talk about the situation.	
1	We have a senior employee in our marketing department who was hired in September 2016 but is not working out. Specifically, he is not able to deliver what we need for the company to be successful and we are planning to terminate his position and bring in someone more senior with a different skill set. The management team interviewed another, more senior person to join us as the head of marketing on a consulting basis. However, we would like to have some overlap between the two individuals. My concerns are that the current incumbent is going to taint the incoming consultant's point of view on the company and that might even have a negative impact on morale with other coworkers once he knows he is leaving (by interacting in an unprofessional manner). We are considering offering him a severance and a retention bonus.	
2	Employer is terminating an employee for bringing a gun into the workplace. Need forms. Will have a second person at the termination.	
3	A client's employee resigned. She had a prior workers' comp injury and had stated she would be looking for other work. She submitted a resignation letter. Later that same day, a workers' comp attorney (not from the client's carrier) faxed a letter to our client rescinding the employee's resignation. Do they have the authority to do that? My client is unsure what to do with that.	
6	Final check to a laid off employee about two weeks ago. However, the check bounced. We reissued the check and put in the mail but the employee has not received it. He wants his check now and wants it in cash. We can not put a stop payment on the check because the person who handles that task is out of the country. We can pay a portion of it in cash. Could we still be liable for a penalty?	
2	Termination notice.	
2	Termination notice.	
1	We have an employee who has been on an performance improvement plan, on his final warning. We have determined that we need to move towards termination. We've been trying to get him to come in for a meeting to process the termination, but he seems to be avoiding the meeting. Can we conduct the meeting over the phone.	
1	If we are a private company, do we have to allow employees to buy back PTO if they are terminated or quit?	
5	We have an employee who we hired in 2015 as supervisor trainee. He went through an extensive interview process. He has been asking for and increase in wages. He started looking for other employment and gave a potential employer my name as a reference . I am in a position where I need to bring another employee up to the trainee position as I need someone to fill the role and move into the supervisor role. His performance and focus has slipped, resulting in a $3000 mistake as of late. The last performance review showed that his performance has dipped.	
3	We will be terminating an employee who worked for us only a few months (4). Will he be eligible for unemployment benefits through his former employer or us? His former employer is out of business now, we bought them out. We'll be paying out severance pay. Will this affect his ability to get benefits?	
4	We terminated an employee on Friday because of an aggressive post she made on FB. The employee took a client to the hospital and entered a Facebook post using the "F" word against the doctor who was treating our client. This is against our company's social media policy. The (former) employee has asked us for a copy of the policy and the copy of the post she wrote, she said because she had since deleted the post. We received a copy of the post from an email from a former employee who saw it on FB and forwarded it to us and to the County. Should I give her a copy of the policy and the post?	
2	Do we tax a severance check?	
2	Is an employment separation related to being a no call/no show considered an involuntary or voluntary termination?	
2	Can you send me termination guidelines for the state of MN? Involuntary without documentation specifically	
4	We have an employee who has been responsible for learning and implementing a new Electronic Healthcare Recording system and the office manager. It has become evident she is not up to the task and needs constant guidance. She lacks the ability to figure things out regarding the system on her own. It is over her head. Her position has been lowered to be solely responsible for the EHR, relieving her as office manager. She has been verbally notified with a list of tasks she is responsible for. A new job description has not been given to her yet. Can we terminate her now? OR should we have her sign a new job description? Since the new job technically is a demotion, can we lower her salary, and give her a 30 day review in this new position. Then put her on a performance review plan if necessary. Can we review her performance/attitude with only a list of tasks and not having an updated formal job description reflecting the office manager duty change?	
1	I have 3 employees we are going to be processing final paychecks for. I will be offering them alternative positions since we will be eliminating their current positions. We are reassigning them. Do I need to issue final paychecks?	
0	We have an employee who has resigned. We have an unlimited amount of time off. The employee has offered three weeks of notice with the last week as "vacation" time. Do I have to pay her for the last week?	
5	We have an employee who we are negotiating a termination with. We initially planed on offering an severance agreement. He would like to remain on our payroll through the end of August so that he can tell other employers he's still employed. If we offer the transition pay through August instead of severance what is his inducement to sign the release of liability as he would if he receive a severance payment.	
5	We have an employee with whom we are negotiating a severance agreement. He would like for us to pay for his COBRA premiums through the end of September. Should we pay those directly to the COBRA administrator or should we pay the money directly to the employee? What are the tax benefits of each? We will not offering a severance payment to the employee. He will be offered transition pay through the end of the month of August so that he can tell future employers he's still employed but he won't be performing work for us.	
0	I recently spoke with an advisor regarding our unlimited PTO policy and payout of an employee's final workweek as vacation. She called me back and claims she spoke to the state and was told we have to honor or payout that final week. What is your take?	
5	As a follow up to my previous question, the employee has yet to provide a date to extend his FMLA leave. The last notes states that he cannot return to work until he sees a specialist and he has an apt to see the specialist. His doctor will not update his paperwork to reflect a return date and we would like to terminate his employment. Can we do so?	
4	Government contractor We have an employee working at a client site and she has given her notice. Her notice period ends this Friday but we are need to remove her early. There are some questionable ethics violations. We would like to discuss the risks of letting her go early?	
6	An employee is located in Colorado. This employee has given us notice and I'm wondering what the final pay timing rules are for the state of Colorado.	
4	We have an employee who resigned by email 7/15 citing ongoing illness, She had told staff she was receiving treatment for a benign brain tumor which was affecting her mental state and in the past had referred to other medical and emotional issues.. She had an emotional meeting with supervisor and Executive Director on 7/10 re failure to receive title change she believed she had been promised. Her supervisor had chosen to defer (not deny) decision until issues he had with her performance and interactions with other staff had been resolved. Executive Director counseled her to go home and rest. She texted her supervisor she needed the week off and told him she was seeing her doctor on 7/14. On 7/13 I called and emailed to remind her to bring a note from her doctor after 3 or more days of absence, per agency policy. On 7/15 she sent an email resigning in order to take time to care for herself & to recover from illness. Does she have grounds legal action or collecting unemployment?	
1	We are closing our Mississippi facility and offering employees a severance. I have a separation and release form that I will be using. Can you tell me the terms for the release. How many days to employees have to sign, once signed, what is the waiting period for their check where they can rescind the agreement? Once the waiting period has passed, how many days do we have to deliver their check? We are a CA company but this location is in MS, so not sure what rules apply. Thanks so much!	
5	Employee in CA was placed on PIP and then notified us that he needs a personal leave of absence for personal reasons. Did not indicate whether medically related. We are not approving his personal leave, would he have any job protection? We gave him a signing bonus of $15k less than a year ago, and the provision was that he had to remain with the company for a minimum of 12 months or be liable for repaying that bonus. We are not taking anything from his final wages. If we invoice him for that amount, will we collect gross or net? He contributed over $6k of that bonus to his 401k. No way to recoup that, right?	
1	We released an employee due to ongoing performance short-falls. In completing the separation notice for unemployment purposes, what do we say?	
2	Do 1099s need to receive a separation notice upon their resignation?	
2	I need assistance completing the notice of change of relationship form for the employee who brought a loaded gun into the workplace. Final question.	
5	Our owners also own a restaurant. A rehired 28-year-old line cook had been her one year before leaving. He is dating a 17-year-old employee. That employees mom found out and called the cops. The girl has not admitted the relationship. He has provided marijuana to her. The cook is back at work and has text messages from the girl proving the relationship was consensual. Can they terminate the cook? Owner is concerned that other minor employees work there.	
5	I am looking to write up a document or complete a separation for for a stylist who didn't report to work on Saturday. The manager called him to come into work and the employee yelled at him saying he was in Atlanta. We consider this a no call no show since the manager had to call him. This is not the first time he was a no call no show. He was suspended for leaving his shift early. (3 days) Want some guidance on the wording of separation.	
6	Employer pays for employee uniforms up front but when an employee is separated from employment, the employee must turn in all uniforms or the employer deducts the cost of the missing uniforms from the final paycheck. The employee acknowledged this policy by signing a document at the beginning of their employment. I understand that the deduction from final wages can't drop the wages below minimum wage, but is the employer allowed to take the uniform costs out of accrued PTO being paid out upon termination (not wages earned by working) that would have been included on the final paycheck?	
3	If a 43 year old employee explained during their 90 day probationary period (not yet completed) they need to have surgery and it is not a work related injury, can you terminate the employee without issue (not in a protected class either)	
6	Does having California employees sign a Final Paycheck Acknowledgement (like the one here from CalChamber http://1080b7859aada3d0beaf-0bfa255627b9560d816ed2fdd9632edf.r19.cf2.rackcdn.com/uploaded/f/0e2989027_1394650946_final-paycheck-acknowledgement-english.pdf ) really protect us in any tangible way that is worth the amount of time they take to generate? Is it really any better than having the employee sign any acknowledgment saying that they received their final check for X amount? We have around 10 employees in California but are headquartered in Austin, TX with about 350 total employees nationwide.	
2	Questions on non-exempt employees, terminating a receptionist, managing meal breaks, non-exempts responding to emails while on leave.	
4	(With Toni, Supervisor) We need to terminate someone today and I need the proper verbiage. An employee was scheduled for jury duty and indicated she was not released and that she had to report. During that day she was not responding and she texted that she was released from jury duty at 4:00 p.m. She states she lost the pink slip to be paid from jury duty. We contacted the court and found out she was not required to report for jury duty. I told her I found she was not required to report and I directed her to go to the court and get something in writing so we could pay her. She came back with a slip stating she was not required to report. She said she showed up and was there from 8-9 then left and she told a coworker that she just wanted the day off. She lied about the situation. We have text messages stating the lies. We feel she should be terminated for timecard falsification. Toni - I did not text her until 12:30. I asked if she was still at jury duty and she said "yes it is just for today." and she confirmed it would be all day. Her position is an outbound assistant and the schedule is constantly changing and she has a special position and we have to have notice to cover the doctor. She came to me and asked me about jury duty because she has never had it before. She apologized for lying and stated she "just wanted a day off."	
0	Do we have to payout vacation and sick at termination in Georgia, New Jersey and New York?	
4	We operate our school 51 weeks per year. Although we allow our teachers to take pre-requested vacation time off, it is with limitations and does not apply to Part Time teachers. One of our part time teachers sent me an email stating that she will be travelling during the summer months and will not be available to work, but she looks forward to returning to the new school year in the fall. Per our policy, we would notify her that this would be considered her resignation, as she is an at-will employee. Can you help me compose the appropriate language?	
6	I have a client who hired an employee from a temp agency. the employee gave notice to the employer on Monday that Friday would be the last day. Friday he was expecting check. Temp agency said it could be another week before the employee receives the check. What are the OR laws regarding final pay?	
5	We have a terminated employee in Casper, WY. Our policy states that he would not eligible to receive his PTO since he left without notice. I am just making sure we do not have to pay him.	
4	We have a workers compensation case. The employee was put on modified duty and last Wednesday we said we can offer you modified duty and let her know to start on 4/3 at 8:30. She called back later and said she had an emergency two week trip out of the country. I expressed to her our concern that shes been off work since November, and that a doctor is seeing you and youll be out of the country and we dont know what will happen to you. According to our adjuster, we were told that we could have her come to our office the next day (Thursday) to sign a form that she is declining modified duty. We discussed that with the employee and set a time for the meeting. She didn't show up on Thursday or Friday. We had heard her plane ticket was for Saturday. Since she didn't come in to speak with us about the decline of modified duty, we expect her to be at work today at 8:30. If she doesnt show up for three days, we can follow our normal process for job abandonment and termination, right?	
3	We have an employee who we terminated on 3/14/17. Payroll, when they cut the final check, they cut two checks, one for 2/28-3/11. For the additional dates worked was issued on 3/11. For both checks they dated it with the same date and deducted from the employees flexible spending account, etc. I understand you can only deduct one per payroll date. The employee is located in TX, even though our headquarters are located in CA.	
3	If an employee is termed do they need to pay them for earned but taken PTO. Or since they were termed can they not pay them. We have in handbook that if employee resigns with no 2 weeks notice no PTO paid out.	
1	We terminated an employee and we are trying to negotiate a settlement package. Does the U.S. offer something similar and can you offer a sample? This employee worked in Florida.	
3	No call/no show - two days, is that grounds for termination? There was an altercation on Thursday, she was a no show on Friday, and again today. It is in our policy that a no call/no show is job abandonment.	
5	An employee has been on disability going on 5 months now and they want to terminate him. I am concerned. The employee wants to come back and they don't want him to come back - he ruined the opportunity. I have never received a doctor's note. I have been asking since the beginning. I sent him FMLA information. He left in November due to back issues. They were done - they decided he's done based on contacting his boss on February 13th extending his leave to March 15th. I emailed and 4 weeks later, (around 3/13) he showed up with his medical file. I turned it away. I told him I sent him the document we needed. I told him we could not guarantee his job. He said his phone was disconnected. He contacted me and added his boss and COO on the email and stated he has a release to return to work on 4/3. I told him he was not approved to return and told him we needed to talk. Friday he emailed me - I told him we had not determined whether he was reinstated - was this ok? I feel like he was trying to set us up. What should we do now?	
5	We had an employee who has been out. The last doctors note the employee has severe sickness and will not be returning to work anymore. I just got this note from the manager but it was from September 2016. The employee almost passed away he was so sick. Do we need to offer FMLA to him?	
3	What is the best way to word my absenteeism policy? How many absences is too many? How many write ups before someone cannot claim unemployment? Can you look up Virginia, Maryland and Arizona? It's 3 write ups in North Carolina before an employee is denied the ability to file for unemployment.	
3	I need some sort of resource to support that an employee who terminated on 3/31/17 should not have an additional deduction for medical premium (amounting to three deductions instead of 2 for the month).	
1	We have an employee voluntarily terminating. We have 13 employees, do we have to provide COBRA notice? (Ronald Wood, rwood@electo-fix.com, 5086950228, has service through Eastern Benefits Group)	
2	California Termination Packet	
5	We have an employee who has been out on a WC leave for a month and we have had no contact with him. Our WC carrier has has no contact him his either. Can we move forward with termination?	
4	We have a legal secretary who was hired in November and she has constant absences (they may be valid). It's either her kids, or something with her car, etc. Can we terminate her at this point? She has used all available paid time off and the absences and constant lateness are impacting the rest of the team.	
2	Do you have a sample termination letter?	
6	A new employee showed for work one day and never returned. After 1 week and numerous unanswered calls we are terminating the person and sending the final check via certified mail with a letter of termination. Is this correct?	
4	We would like to terminate a manager due to insubordination. She has not been counseled or written up in the past, but the company owners do not want to extend the employment relationship any longer. Can we have her sign a non-compete agreement, or an agreement not to take our employees, or the knowledge of our employees that she has?	
4	On 11/1 an employee was issued a final warning for insubordination (being rude to her supervisor). An additional incident would be grounds for termination. What took place this morning is unrelated to her prior warnings but they want to terminate. What are your thoughts? The office manager saw this employee's office door was closed and with the lights off. She opened the door and found the employee lying on the ground, asked if she was okay and the employee responded that she was on the floor for a few seconds only hoping her headache would go away. Because our policy states that employees need to notify their supervisor if they are not feeling well and she didn't, they want to make this her termination reason.	
6	If a California employee walks out saying they quit, do we count the weekend towards the 72 hours for their final paycheck?	
6	We have an employee who died and we need to know what do about his final paycheck. If we want to mail it to his final paycheck without completing the affidavit, can we mail it?	
3	Can an employer terminate an employee during their six month probationary period without a reason?	
6	regarding termination. we are calling an employee in who is suspended to get final check. Do we need to pay them for calling them in to pick up the final check?	
6	We have an employee that has given their 2-week notice. Her insurance is valid through the end of the month. Are we legally able to deduct her final portion of the health, dental, etc in her last paycheck. Typically that deduction would be in the last paycheck of the month for which she will no longer be employed.	
2	What are the termination requirements in California?	
3	My question is, I have to do a layoff. I have a woman that is out on maternity leave who would be part of the layoff and I just wanted to talk about that with someone.	
6	Payroll deduction on final pay - if we take out the full month's worth of health benefit premiums, that will give her a net pay of $44.00. This will bring her well below minimum wage for hours worked. Is that permissible?	
4	We have an employee who has been on medical leave for 8 weeks, going into the 9th week. We are swamped and feel we are facing an 'undue hardship' at this point. We needed people so we began interviewing and we made a job offer today. At 2:30 the person said she is going to think about it but wants to consider it and sleep on it and let me know tomorrow. After I made the offer, I received an email from the woman in my office who oversees the service team members. She received a note from the employee who is out and she said she is feeling better and will be back next Tuesday. Our employee manual says on return from leave the company may return them to original job, another leave, or the employment may be terminated. Do I have to give this employee her job back?	
5	We have an employee who has been out on a leave. He is planning to return to work, but is jaw is wired shut and therefore he may be unable to perform his job as one of the essential job functions is to speak. He is part of a weight staff. We have to layoff 1 FT and 1 PT person. We have chosen him. Is there any liability?	
1	We will be processing a termination due to a client/contract change and budgetary requirements. We have three (3) employees at a client site, and their contract has ended. The renewal will only permit keeping two (2) employees. How do we communicate this to the employee who will be laid-off? The client made the ultimate decision of who was retained and not. We will be giving the employee a two week notice of separation. If the employee opts to leave earlier, are we obligated to pay him for the two week period? Do we have to extend severance?	
1	We have an employee that is chronically ill (various regular colds, etc.). May we fire her?	
6	lauren@forte.fit Lauren Foundos 516-376-3519 9 Terminated an employee in California. What are the final pay requirements. Employer wired final pay to employee's checking account on the date of termination and advised the employee of the termination.	
1	We have a former employee who has filed for Unemployment Insurance (UI). We used your services to properly document the reason for separation, gross insubordination. How do we complete the UI form?	
4	I have an employee that is constantly late and absent. She also is bad at her job...... I want to let her go. What are my options	
1	We require our employees to check in and offer their availability so we can schedule them accordingly and have two (2) employees who have not been able to accept work in a given workweek or have been non-responsible for a period of several months. May be terminate? Is this involuntary or voluntary?	
5	Hi, I have an employee who was constantly absent (on and off) while on his 60 day probationary period. He has not reported to work in over 2 weeks now but we had not terminated him because he came highly recommended by one of our Managers. I will be sending him a Job Abandonment Certified letter today as I have done in the past with previous employees. Please confirm if the letter is absolutely necessary at this point- since he's already not been reporting to work for 2 weeks now. In addition, please advise what his termination day should be in our Active Employee records (Paylocity). Would it be the last day he worked or today's date as that is the date on the letter? Please review and confirm. Thanks and regards, D. Garcia (786) 230-2804	
1	Employees who are given a stippend, and allowance for cell phones. Some employees get CC and gas cards. Some get laptops. We want to create a form, checklist of what we give employees. Change of relationship form- can we add a section about equipment?	
1	We are going to be conducting a reduction in force which will impact 13 employees. One of the impacted employees will be the individual we previously discussed who was bitten by a dog onsite. The manager of his department is being impacted and his two peers are also being impacted. However, we want to offer his two peers positions as sales people, but not him. The decision is based on performance. On individual is clearly outpacing him in performance and the other is doing better as well but I'm not certain how large the performance gap is. They were all hired around the same time, none of them are 40 or over and the two being offered alternative positions are both female. Additionally, if someone is on FMLA and impacted by the RIF, do we have to consider anything special?	
1	The questions is when an employee gives a 2 week notice and we wish to not abide by that, do we have to? Or can we just tell the employee that we don't need them anymore?	
3	if an employee was approved for time off prior to a suspension resulting in termination. Are they entitled to be paid for the time previously submitted?	
5	An employee works as an installer and his knees are failing him where he can no longer perform the essential job duties. We have no other position for him to transfer to. Since we do not have STD benefits, I would like to lay him off so that he can collect UI, until he can get his knee repaired to continue working. Risks?	
5	We have a person who was a full time employee but is now a 1099 employee. Can he still collect unemployment?	
4	We received a resignation letter from an employee that stated " I am giving my notice in order to help my daughter with her children. It has been a pleasure to work for the Caring Community. I am available to work the followiing days to help with the transition 7/12/17, 7/27/17, 7/3/17. Thank you again for the opportunity to work at the Caring Community. She is arguing that she should have been paid holiday time for 7/4/17. She states she only works 1 day a week and worked her 1 day that week on 7/3/17. Being her last day worked and resignation was effective on 7/3/17. We did not pay her holiday time. Should we have?	
3	If an employee is under work restrictions from a non-work related injury, and we have moved the employee to several different positions within those restrictions, but the employee is still saying they cannot do the job, can we terminate?

2	Hello. Can you please provide guidance on final wages to deceased in Connecticut? For example, how they are taxed versus if the last week was vacation pay? In addition, are there any resources available on how unreimbursed expenses should be processed. Thank you, Jaime	
1	We have a couple of employees who have worked for us about 5-6 years. There is no documentation of any disciplinary action however, the manager says these employees are working below the needs of the job and wants to terminate at-will. Both are black and I"m concerned this will appear discriminatory. What are your thoughts?	
6	Do we issue a final paycheck on an employees last day of employment?	
4	We have an employee out on maternity leave for 4 months and she is requesting another 6 months. She is asking for us to lay her off so she can collect unemployment. We currently have a part time employee filling her position. Would we be able to lay her off?	
5	We are terminating an employee who has had behavioral problems in the past including coming into the office after hours to sleep, and defacing his office by spraying some type of liquid on the walls and spilling his business cards around his office. We have been working with him for a while, understanding he has a mental health condition or addiction problem. He is now in a detox, but we are moving forward with the termination due to defacing company property and violation of company policy. Pay day is Friday, and I am going to keep his direct deposit active, as we understand that he is currently homeless. His address on file is his father's house, but we understand he has been evicted from that house. Oregon law requires us to pay him within 24 hours from date of termination, but without his ability to come to the office, we are going to make his funds available to him via direct deposit, 3 days after his termination date. Risks? He has a loan and we will not be able to collect on that loan, we understand we will absorb that cost. Can we discuss COBRA and 401k notices?	
1	I was informed by Chicago public schools we would need to eliminate a position in our special education department. We identified who we will let go due to qualifications needed for a future program we are planning for.	
5	We had an employee who started on June 19th his last day physically worked was June 30th. He has had medical issues and not worked since. We did a leave without pay. When would last day be? The last day physically worked? or July 14th RTW which is when we made the decision to not allow him anymore days to get resolved. He would be eligible for benefits on July 1st. Would like to discuss.	
1	We have over 100 employees nationwide, approximately 70 in CA, and we are closing down a plant that has approximately 7 employees, both union and non-union. Would the federal WARN Act and/or the CA WARN Act apply to this business closure? May we provide 60 days severance in lieu of providing notice? What other factors should we consider?	
1	Good Morning, We have an employee who has exhausted their medical leave. At this point we need to replace the position. We would like to offer a severance package with pay through the end of the year, COBRA, but with a 1-2 year no compete as this is a VP role. Is there any issue with that? Sincerely, Kelly Dougherty	
4	We are a company of about 100 people. A director of a division, a woman is married to one of her subordinates. He is a staff level person - they were married before they worked together here. They separated and he began an affair with another subordinate on the same team (the wife's team). This woman was up for review and the director had to administer her review and recommended her for a 5% raise, which we gave her. The employee said to the president/owner can we talk about the raise (because she was not happy about it). He directed to her to me, as he had discussed the raise with the director. She never came to talk to me and she resigned. According to the director she quit because the husband told her to quit. What do we do and what action can we take against the male employee? She quit last night and said she is moving out of state. We have no rule against dating. The male employee is acting real unprofessional, I feel. He has not done anything unprofessional besides telling her (the female employee) to quit. How does it benefit us to ask about the raise?	
2	Are we required to give terminated employees the form UIA 1711 in Michigan?	
3	Do you have any forms for repayment agreements? As in to ask an employee to repay the company for any loans if they are to be separated within a certain timeframe?	
1	Employee has been with the company less than 90 days. A competitor has closed its door and we are wanting to hire some of their more seasoned employees. Therefore, the owner would like to terminate the new employee in order to hire the employee from the competitor. What reasons do i give her for a termination?	
5	We have a very disgruntled employee. He refuses to wear safety glasses and has already been written up three times. He also refuses to take our 2 mins training videos stating that it's not his job and that we can fire him if we want to. He has a performance review coming up. He is upset because about a year ago he only received about a 50 cent raise, but he has not demonstrated good work performance and furthermore, refuses to follow safety procedures.	
1	I have 2 questions - 1 -The first one is about correct phrasing for a termination, like a reason 2- The other one is regarding exempt vs non- exempt compliance. We have a shipping manager who manages only 1 employee, and I want to see if we can pay him overtime.	
1	We do seasonal cold weather shelters in addition to the homeless shelters. The seasonal shelters have been extended every year. We will hire certain individual seasonally. Previously we would terminate their employment. We are now considering keeping them on instead. They would just not be working for 4 months. What are the issues in doing this?	
2	Do you have a sample Exit Interview?	
5	California employee - has been a no show for three days. What should we do? We've called and he hasn't returned our calls. Also he owes us some money for a loan. Can we take it out of his check even if it leaves him with a zero balance.	
6	An employee has resigned and we are paying out their final check. They have a negative PTO balance of 40 hours. Per company policy, we deduct that from the final paycheck.	
2	An employer in California with over 100 employees is having to close down their facility. What information can you provide regarding the federal and California state WARN Acts, and how employers need to manage this process?	
1	Follow up: We will be closing down our Austin location which has 28 FTEs. Will we need to provide the WARN Notice to those 28 employees? We will be closing down our Dallas location which has over 50 employees, but we are offering a transfer to our other Dallas location for 90% of those employees and will be laying off 10% of them. Is the WARN Notice required for our Dallas location?	
1	We are looking at terminating an employee. What types of documentation should we have. Termination	
5	We have an employee and on May 24 he no call no showed and they both agreed that his next time would be a suspension and possible termination. On July 7 he was spoken to about productivity. Today he called an hour after his shift and he told his supervisor he was having car trouble and he was suspended for today. They want to let him go for production. The supervisor wants to know for them to terminate him now? They need to call in at least one hour ahead of their scheduled shift per our company policy.	
5	We had an employee who started on June 19th his last day physically worked was June 30th. He has had medical issues and not worked since. We did a leave without pay. When would last day be? The last day physically worked? or July 14th RTW which is when we made the decision to not allow him anymore days to get resolved. He would be eligible for benefits on July 1st. Would like to discuss.

3	Client has an employee who has been with them for 2 years who have breast cancer; restructuring company and eliminating all positions in her job. What are the employers exposure?	
4	We are a medical staffing company. We employee different medical staff to work for our end client on hourly per Diem. I have an employee I want to fire. No call no show for the last 2 shifts. Have tried to have her and have gotten no response from her. How formal do I need to be in this process to be compliant. We have signed document that if she is no-call no show we will not continue employment. Can I just mail her a letter and be done? She is not due anymore pay.	
4	We have a small office where a family of employees works. A new employee was hired for that office. She filed a complaint with the corporate office stating she felt uncomfortable working there with the lead person of the office. He never made eye contact with her, never talked to her, etc. They decided to fire her to avoid future risk with her given she filed a complaint. What are your thoughts on how this was handled?	
3	We are terminating a person for cause today. They brandish their firearm on the 10th of July. What date do I put on the form?	
3	I have a client the sent the email below with an employee relation question and I wanted to run it by you guys. See below. I have two employees that have been on our radar recently. There have bene many factors for both of these employees that have raised our attention. One is that they continue to use cell phones at their desks which is against company policy. Each have bene written up at least once for these actions. The other major thing has been their attitude in the office and with other employees. We monitor our employees emails when these situations arise to make sure our customers are getting the level of performance that we guarentee. In monitoring their email we have found emails between the two employees that state in several different ways that they are hoping to get fired so that they can collect unemployment. We have only scratched the surface, and have found many emails with this as the topic. On our corporate email servers during work hours...... We also monitor internet usage, and can see one of the two repeatedly on Indeed.com throughout the day almost every day. I have had issues in the past where it seems to me that it is a clear case for the employee to not collect unemployment, and they go on to collect the full amount for as long as possible. I know that you cannot give a definitive answer yes or no, but I want to know if those emails are grounds for termination with low chance of me having to payout unemployment. Please get back to me when you can. Thanks!	
4	We maybe firing somebody tomorrow and I want to talk it through with someone - ongoing issue with an employee. We want to get some final advice on the proper separation agreement with a NDA. The employee has been under performing the last 4-5 months and has been on a weekly PIP and it is not going well and she is saying you have to terminate me. We definitely have cause for termination but we want to be fair and equitable and offer her a package. How can we minimize legal implications? She is age 63, and was with the company 14 years. I got some language on separation agreements. The employee cut the conversation off with the supervisor and stated she wanted to speak to with the executive director and she wants a package. She said "I'm done" and refused to put together the plan. She's coming in and getting her work done, the supervisor is not speaking with her. She has decided not speak to her supervisor. No prior supervisor documented the performance issues in the past. Was does the 21 days' consideration mean? If she were terminated tomorrow, do we have to have an agreement written? Can we agree that we will draft an agreement? Paid administrative leave - that assumes we put together a package without input from her? Then we offer the package - she states she wants 9 months to a year for health coverage and cash. We're a non-profit. The executive director offered to mentor her to find another job. She said she has been so beaten up here she cannot look for other employment.	
4	I have an exempt employee we will terminate tomorrow. She only worked Monday of this payroll period. She called in sick today.

The notification and election letter is attached, and it is the employer responsibility to notify the former employee of his rights to continue. If he elects, Dana is responsible for the full cost of the coverage. He also has a special enrollment period to enroll in individual coverage. You have 10 days from the date of coverage termination to provide him the letter. He has 30 days from the date of coverage termination to elect and remit payment to United Transportation Services.

2	I see that you all have a termination notice listed however, I am needing to obtain termination forms for the use of our clients. Do you happen to have a standard version of a termination form that can be sent over to us upon the termination of an employee?	
3	My question is, can an employer hold an expense reimbursement check from a terminated employee who has not returned company equipment? The employee is in Illinois.	
4	We have an employee who is not capable of performing the job. She's not meeting expectations, and we've been working with her. She's working 80 hours a week, she's not sleeping and she's started smoking again. She has two more weeks to improve her performance, and this doesn't happen we'll need to proceed with termination. We would like to offer her the option to resign with two weeks pay and benefits. We want to allow her to leave with dignity and on her own terms. If she agrees to resign we will agree to not "fight" her unemployment claim. Whereas if she is terminated we'll have to state the facts and if she's terminated for cause she won't receive unemployment.	
1	Hi Bethany, One more follow up question for you related to our discussion regarding the dog incident as it relates to the RIF. Are we able to take experience into account for our business decision regarding the decision as to which 2 individuals we offer sales positions to? [cid:image001.png@01D2FFEB.B13B80F0] Above is the objective results from inception through June regarding the sales opportunities the 3 individuals created. As you can see, there is a huge gap between Kristin and Hailey. There is a smaller gap between Hailey and Casey (Casey is the individual weve been discussing), so the results back up our decision, however the gap isnt as big as wed like. The other thing that is factoring into the decision is actual sales experience. Kristen and Hailey both have sales experience, specifically selling to businesses like our customers. Casey does not have this experience. So in summary, our business decision is based on objective results, and relevant experience.... Are we taking on undue risk? Thanks for being a resource Bethany. -Spencer Direct: 952-279-2364 Spencer Barron VP of Finance WAND - The Future of Restaurant Technology (W) www.wandcorp.com (E) spencer.barron@wandcorp.com (P) 800.RUN.WAND

2	Can you please send information about severance and release statements?	
6	A client in FL is preparing a final check for an employee who was terminated for cause. The employee has not returned his uniforms. May the employer deduct the cost of the uniforms from his final check? The employee made numerous errors causing the company to lose money on customer services. May they charge the employee for those losses?	
3	We will be terminating a part-time employee, as due to reevaluation of the job needs. This position needs to be full-time. The individual attends school; therefore we know they cannot accept full-time with us. Are they eligible for UI?	
6	Hi, looking for guidance on handling an employee's final paycheck when their negative on PTO.	
5	An employee has had excessive absences in the past several months due to a medical condition. I provided him with FMLA paperwork and he refused it stating that it is only a sinus infection. His absences are to the scope that it warrants termination, as he has already been written up for his absences, in accordance with our policy. He is refusing to provide any medical justification for his absences. May we terminate his employment?	
2	The question is regarding severance packages. I terminated an employee recently and they are asking if he will receive a severance pay or a severance package. The termination was involuntary due to poor performance.	
6	We have a part-time employee who has provided us with four days notice. Do have to provide her with her final paycheck right away or can we wait until our next pay date which is at the end of the month?	
2	I just have a quick question about exit checklist. When employees are terminated/leave what paperwork/info is given to them upon their exit? Do you have a sample exit checklist that I could obtain?	
1	We have two voluntary resignation coming up next week, one is with effective date 7/25/2017, the other is 7/26/2017.

1	Good Morning, We have an employee who has exhausted their medical leave. At this point we need to replace the position. We would like to offer a severance package with pay through the end of the year, COBRA, but with a 1-2 year no compete as this is a VP role. Is there any issue with that?

5	Termination question: We have an employee that has worked in the maintenance department for over 5 years.Last week while working on the golf course he experienced shortness of breath and an elevated heart rate. An ambulance was called and he was taken to the hospital. Employee was released and returned to work on Tuesday. Employee stated he was released with a light duty request. At this point we are not sure if he provided a release document to his supervisor. Yesterday, the employee over fertilized an area of the golf course which has caused major damage. This is something that an employee with 5 years experience would know the harm that this would cause. The GM at the golf course feels this might have been intentional and is afraid to have him return to work. Currently he has asked him to stay home. Can we terminate him for this huge mistake?	
5	Situation is: we had an employee who did not follow call out procedures and had attendance and lateness issues that led to termination. Recently I received paperwork from department of labor about his discharge. and DOL determined he was not eligible for benefits. Our company would prefer that he received the unemployment benefits. He appealed the determination and there is ow a hearing. My question is, we don't want to go to the hearing, but we want to supply either him or the referee office with a letter saying we don't think his misconduct was willful and would support him receiving the unemployment benefits. Before I send I just want to make sure there was nothing wrong with doing that.	
4	We are going to terminate an employee who has been with us for almost a year. She is not a very good performer but she does try. She is also not willing to work more hours (she works part time). We have found a replacement and would like some guidance on how to best tell her. What are the risks? She is older but so is the entire workforce.	
2	Would you send me information on severance agreement for an employee over 40 years of age?	
5	We are submitting payroll today. One of the MRI techs put in his resignation, and his last day was last Friday.

What is your guidance on how this situation should be handled? What is our obligation to the company and to the employee? Can we term? Must we term?	
5	I have an employee who hasn't been here yet for 90 days and he just texted us that he quit. He still has keys to the building we would like to collect. Can I stop the direct deposit and ask that he come in to collect final wages? This way, he is more likely to come in and return the keys.

5	Employee will be terminated today and I just want to run by my thinking on how much PTO he should be paid given the way he showed up for work this week. On Jan 2 he was scheduled to work but call in 2 hours late, on Jan 3 went to job site stayed in truck the whole time and never went to speak with customer, he was told to wait there until the supervisor showed up but he left anyway. Im not sure what he worked yesterday, and today we were going to terminate him and he did not show up for work. Q last week we had a company wide shut down and I want to confirm what we should pay him. We paid employees - 12 hours holiday and they can use 28 PTO. Our holiday policy is clear employee must work day before and after. We use a point system for PTO - he had 8 hours of points and was going to borrow 20 points from 2017. Should I allow him to use the 8 points but not borrow the 20 points?	
2	I need a termination letter for an associate we termed before the 90 day introductory period.

1	We require time off request forms to be submitted by employee's and their request must be approved for them to take the time off.

1	We are doing some restructuring, and we're combining two separate roles that are in different departments into one. Its hard to explain, but one is a Team Manager for Production, and one is a Community Impact Coordinator (which we'd be promoting to Manager) that works closely with Production. We are working on the new title and JD, but it would be in the Production Department, where the Team Manager works. How do we go about this? The Team Manager is underperforming, on a PIP & does not have the experience or skills to do the new combined position. The current Community Impact Coordinator is performing highly and has the skill to do both. Do we terminate the Team Manager for underperformance, and then restructure the two roles and offer the promotion to the other person? Or do we lay the TM off as a part of the restructure, and let him know that someone else will be taking on his role in addition to their own? And it might look similar, but it is a new role in a new capacity? Thanks

4	In regards to an employee we terminated, we sent her her separation letter and asked her to sign it that she was good with the terms and she has until Friday. This is a severance agreement with a release statement. She countered and now is waiting. Normally we send people their life insurance and we have 30 days to do that. Should we do that now or wait until she returns the release/severance statements?	
1	We are planning on terminating an employee and are seeking guidance as we have not done terminations in the past. The employee does not have the skill set to maintain his position. We have counseled him in the past, and have provided him with email follow ups on the expectations that we need to see. Can we discuss? If we wanted to offer severance, how would that work? He is under age 40.

I investigated and have received written statements from each of the complainants.

Can I bring that info in to my discussion with him? We would like to terminate him due to these complaints, compounded with ongoing other performance issues we have had with him, but are concerned because of his WC claim. Please advise.	
5	Im the single HR person here. In April, our janitor, who had 5 months service claims he was injured while pushing the floor polisher, and hurt his shoulder. There were no witnesses. He requested someone take him to ER, and was told to go home and seek medical attention. He went to PT and they suggested 3 weeks off. When he came back to work he said it was still bothering him. Given the nature of his work we can't accommodate him. Meanwhile, I found a temporary janitor. The employee comes back with note stating he is going for surgery. Finally got surgery last Friday. Travelers, our WC carrier, is saying it will be 3-5 months to recover. They want to know if we are going to release him. Im not sure how to answer that question.

Please advise.

5	I just needed guidance regarding a termination Friday. The employee is sending threatening emails and I don't know if I should take them seriously or not. I started in October. Got to know employees. This employee has always had chip on shoulder, he is very negative, stirs the pot. Has bad attendance, etc. Everyone has had enough of it. The last straw happened on Friday. He is supposed to arrive at 8:30 am, no show. At 9:45 am he sends text, I'm on my way. Got pulled over by a cop. That Monday he was sick, but came to work, and then stayed home Tuesday. Wednesday he came back in and we had just finished payroll. He was pissed off because he didn't get his sick day. Two times he came to the front and harassed the payroll department. The payroll manager asked for him to be suspended for the way he was acting. We didn't suspend him that day because of work need. I wanted to suspend him on Friday, but the managers wanted him terminated. So Friday, he pulled the tardiness scenario. Supervisor hit his limit. We fired the employee. The employees starts emailing at 9:25 pm stating he wants a meeting with the president. I responded today, this was a final decision the president made it with the management team. Then he goes on a rant. I'm calling legal on false termination. He also resumes a tirade regarding an eye situation from last fall. Then he says You are very sexual in speaking to me. I was the one who got the company to give him a chance due to his background (foster kid). He is now taking this all out on me.

4	Received question from client: We are trying to get in touch with an employee to terminate her. She last worked 2 hours on Wednesday. We do not want to have to keep paying her PTO while trying to contact her. Legally, can we tell her that her last day was the last day that she worked? Or do we have to wait until we are able to notify her over the phone of the termination? Or, is there some middle ground? If at all legally possible, we would like to her last day worked to be her last pay date. We do have a policy that you have to work on your last day, but that has only been applied to those voluntarily separating.	
0	PTO. We have a situation that makes us rethink our PTO policy. Is it OK to add things all the time? We are second guessing our payout policy. We have one lump bucket for sick and vacation. Our policy states that in the employees last month, any leave you take will be unpaid and you will get 50% of the PTO balance paid out. We have a 50% payout policy, but we don't want people to take time off after resigning just to use the PTO. Layoff policy - we don't have a severance. We have only paid it out once. But one guy didn't get it and Im concerned it may look like it was due to race.

5	We have an employee who has worked for 25.5 months. Last year, he used 480 hours of FMLA. As of June 6, 2017, he has once again started using intermittent (Periodic) FLMA, for a separate matter. The employee and his direct report manager have a well established protocol for communicating whether or not the employee will be showing up for work, or using FMLA. They have established that they will clearly communicate via phone call or text message, for each instance of FMLA use. On Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, July 19, 20, 21 - the employee failed to communicate his intention of using FMLA, but did not report to work. When HR tried to contact him on Friday, July 21 there as no reply. Due to these 3-consecutive days of no-call, no-show, the employee surpassed the maximum attendance points allowed in a 6-month rolling time frame. The employee was recently contacted and acknowledged that he, "screwed up", by not communicating. Please offer advice- can we term his employment?

3	We have a client that has a Contract Staffing division. A contract employee that was placed with one of their clients was injured and sent to get treated/drug tested right away. They just determined he tested positive on his drug test for marijuana. Our client planned on having their staffing division let the employee go because of the positive drug test, but they are in the middle of a Workers' Compensation claim for him. He only had two days off work, so no more indemnity is being paid, just medical. They have a "Drug and Alcohol Free Workplace' policy in their handbook. I was concerned about one paragraph in the handbook that was vague. Can I please email the paragraph for an opinion?

5	We are going to terminate an employee. He is not scheduled today, do we have to pay him for 4 hours?	
3	If we have a current employee whose status is "casual" and they haven't worked in 2 years because we don't have any work to offer to them. What is the best approach to terminate their employment status? Or is it better to leave them as causal to avoid having to pay unemployment benefits?	
3	If you did not hand out your handbook, that says after 3 days of a no show it is considered abandonment of job and will be assumed you voluntarily quit, yet an employee has missed 4 consecutive days as no shows (no communication on absence) can you send a letter on Abandonment of job? I guess my question is how important is it that they received the company policy related to abandonment of job? When would we safely be able to consider it a voluntary quit?	
6	When are final wages due in California when an employee resigns? Can we pay via direct deposit? Are we obligated to pay out vacation?	
3	If an employee quits on April 4th. And we already paid for the whole month of April for Health insurance. Can you take the amount owed by the employee out of their last check.

5	We have an employee who had a work related injury and we were accommodating his restricitons. He just failed to show up for work for the last couple of weeks. We called ThinkHr and got advice about sending a letter asking the employee to call us about his absences before we decide to terminate. We did that and he has not called us or sent in a note excusing his time off. We would like to terminate.	
1	If an employee terminates their employment giving two weeks notice, but we decide not to take that notice and let them go early, do we treat it as a termination or resignation as far as the last check is concerned? Should that decision be made immediately upon resignation, or can we make the determination after one week?	
4	Walking off the job / Grounds for termination in California? Hello, Earlier this afternoon we had an employee say she was going to the bathroom and she never returned.

However, he just came in an hour before the end of shift and said he over slept and would like to use a sick day since he is now not feeling well. Do you think it's risky to terminate since he said he wants to use a sick pay for today. I have already printed the final check but won't have someone to sign it until tomorrow.

We found emails, while she was out, that are very concerning and we are terminating her employment, today, for cause. She is not in the building.

4	We have question is we have employee just hired on April 10th. She has been calling in sick a lot and leaving early.

We are waiting for the assistant manager to return from her vacation in order to get everyone together to manage the transition.

She is making things difficult, so we wanted to know if we could tell her we are honoring her resignation, pay her through the date she provided, but ask her to leave now.

Can you please pass this question on to the HR consultant :) If an employee is terminated with no cause and then information arises after the termination that leads us to put cause on the request for unemployment... are we obligated to let the employee know what causes were listed on the unemployment request the lead to them being denied benefits?

1	Our policy on retirement reads: It is the policy of the Company that employees shall retire no later than the full retirement age as defined by the Social Security Administration unless the Board of Directors otherwise provides. Normal retirement date is the first of the month immediately following or coincident with the full retirement age as defined by the Social Security Administration. I know for some industries mandatory retirement age is legal but was unsure about banking. Can you please give some insight on this. I submitted a question a while ago about mandatory retirement age. I think I put that we are public but since we are owned by shareholders I guess that would make us private.	
5	Hi there, We have an employee who we terminated earlier this year. He filed for unemployment and the status is pending from the state. He just reached out to ask if we could send him his last 2 pay stubs he received from us. Is it compliant to send those pay stubs to him?

1	We are closing down one of our companies. There are only 4 employees. Is there anything we need to be aware of when terminating?	
5	an employee quit and now can not pick up his paycheck. He has asked if a friend could pick it up. Is this ok with the laws in CA?	
3	An employee in California was recently suspended by his manager. They are expecting to let him go on his last day of suspension. We understand that in California when an employee is let go, we need to also provide their last check. In this transaction is there anything that a manager should or shouldn't say to the employee? What is some advice you can give me in regards to termination in California.	
2	In regards to a severance, is there a release where he can waive future grievance/potential claim?	
1	We have an employee we will be letting go of due to performance issues. Do you have any guidance as to how to communicate this?	
5	Confirm my thoughts about a situation. Employee of 20 years has had performance issues for the past 19 years no write ups. This last year, he has continued with tardiness, attendance, negligence and we started to write him up. Last time, he was suspended for a week without pay and told any other infraction will result in termination. Over the weekend, during a marque event, he disappeared for an hour, leaving the clients without anyone in attendance. Clients were pissed. I assume he left during the event to get supplies. He had asked his manager to schedule him an hour in advance so that they can get prepared. Should I give him the benefit of the doubt and another final warning?	
5	EE 30 year employee. Was moved to another position to help us out and the plan was for him to retire. We are now real slow and there just isn't enough work to keep him busy. Would like to talk about transitioning him out.	
4	I'm looking at terming an employee. Had this employee for about 90 days. She's an assistant to me and my brother and my dad. It's just not working out. Clashing of personalities. We are looking at just getting rid of the position all together I am also contacting my attorney. Would like to hear what you guys have to say as well. We have struggled finding the right person. We hired somebody 90 days ago and she is just not the right fit. We do not have good chemistry. We wanted an older female single type of person who has little distraction, but she is an emotional wreck. Her performance has been average. We were going to do a 90 day review next week and I don't think we are going to get back to her. I don't see us needing a 5th person anymore. I don't want to talk about performance and just say we are eliminating the position. 4 times when I have given constructive criticism she has asked to leave early. She has a tough time with any correction. Yesterday I asked her if there was a problem with our communication because she has to leave the office - 6 times in 3 months. She calls someone. She says she'll leave her personal stuff to lunchtime. She denied it was related. Truly its easier to take this work on individually. She emailed at 5:30 am today to call out sick.	
5	writing for a client - they have a new employee as of June 5th. They have 60 day probationary period. He's been late once and had 2 no-call, no-shows. Then 3 weeks in he injures himself at home and is on a medical leave. cannot lift anything and therefore cannot do the job he was hired for. He's not been added to the group health plan yet as he didn't hit 60 days Does the employer have the right to lay him off?? - he needs to replace him.	
4	An employee quits and give us a 3 day notice. Her last day is Friday. We tell her that we will pay her through Friday, but she does not have to come back to work. Is this a termination?	
5	Nonexempt employee is resigning after only two days of employment. Do we have to pay him for these two days? He showed up today and quit and he worked (training) Monday and Tuesday.

2	Hello, We have a short term employee (non-contractor) with us who has finalized a project and his services are no longer needed. Are there any considerations to make when ending their employment? What verbiage do you propose to use in the termination agreement letter? Thank you	
1	We extended an offer of employment to an individual. This individual accepted our offer in written form. The employee was slated to start on x date, however on this day the employee contacted his manager via text message indicating due to family emergency they would need to delay the start date. At this point we are unsure when the employee can start, and they have not been entirely forthcoming or professional in keeping us apprised of their start date. In light of this, we do want to rescind the offer. Is this possible?	
6	Under Indiana law can an employer withhold money from the final check of an employee for uniforms that have not been returned? A final check would be due to termination, either voluntary or un-voluntary. My hunch is No since it may be construed as a Fine, which is not permitted. Does this sound right?	
6	We have an employee that's quitting and owes a loan to the owner. Is it ok to take her entire paycheck to pay back the loan?	
4	Unregistered User: Cindy Garrett cgarrett@burksent.com 610-376-3738 x234 We have an employee who has been out several times due to her own serious health condition. In her absence we have had an independent contractor come in to do her job. After a careful analysis of her job performance and the cost, it is more cost effective to eliminate her position and outsource it to the independent contractor. The employee is 65 and has been with the company for a long time. What are the risks associated with this?	
3	Small NJ employer group had an employee quit and give 2 weeks notice, however, they did not allow him to work the 2 weeks due to nature of situation. Now, the termed employee is asking for pay for his 2 weeks that he didn't work. Does the group have to pay?	
1	Received a strange phone call from someone outside of the company advising that an employee is going outside of the company to a competitor and sharing trade secrets. Although this notice cannot be verified, we are fairly confident that this is true as some of the details provided make sense. He has has performance issues, and in January we were going to limit his territory and provide him with a performance improvement plan. We want to move forward with termination. We are meeting with our legal counsel on Monday, however, I would like your opinion on this in the meantime.

1	My company is having to lay off a group of employees in our five locations throughout California and North Carolina.

4	We recently terminated a sale rep. They had problems with her not following instructions. It was mostly performance issues. She wants to know the reason for her termination. How should I respond?	
3	Is it possible for someone to receive unemployment if they resign from their position? In other words, if they resign and then apply for unemployment, and the former employer does not challenge the claim, can/will they receive unemployment? Or do they need to be laid off?	
1	We are conducting lay offs at our company, but would like to offer to some of the salary full time employees to move to a per diem status. We do not know at this point how many hours they will be working, but we predict that it will be less than 20 hours/week. I would like to know if this is still considered as a layoff or if it is move to a per diem status if we technically terminating them.	
4	We have an employee that abandoned her truck on the on ramp at Gretna. This morning when I spoke with the terminal manager it was cut and dried, shes termed. She left hundreds of thousands of dollars of equipment on the side of the road (with the keys in it), along with customer freight. The truck was flashing check engine lights and she called another driver to come get her. It is my understanding that she flipped attitude and said some things to the effect of f this, if Kearney doesnt want to get this thing running before they send it this way, f it, Im not going to worry about it. Im tired, Im going home. When it was communicated to her that she was going to be termed, the story changed to she panicked, and the weather was -6 degrees. Would the greater risk be with keeping her knowing she's had two other accidents in the past, or with terming her and her argument of "she feared for her saftey" with the -6 degree weather (she was 1/8 of a mile from a service station).	
1	What notices do we need to provide employees, whom will be part of a company layoff?	
2	Can you please provide general information about layoffs/reductions in force as we discussed earlier today?	
1	We are having to conduct a series of layoffs at our company and I would like to get some advice on Severance Pay. We are planning to give Severance Pay in both states of California and North Carolina. We may use the option of salary continuation. If we decide to provide one week pay, but our last payday does not fall on the last day then can we pay them the following Friday? Also, in this case, what would be their official termination date, the last day worked or the last day we pay them? As a second option if we decide we want to give the employees one week's pay as a lump sum, does it have to be given on their last day of work? Or can we spread out this amount over a period of time? Also, when are we obligated to pay out the remainder of PTO? I know for NC it can be on the normal payday, but for CA can it be on the day we provide their last payment?	
4	unregister user: Joshua Kay jk@chango.co 718-455-2002 question: We notified an employee that she would be terminated and we would be offering a 2-week severance. She then emailed me stating that she had been trying to get an email to me and it wasn't going through but her intention was that they accept her voluntary resignation instead. I responded in writing that we accepted her resignation but then we rescinded the severance offering. My attorney agreed, why would we offer severance if she's resigning. Do you agree?

2	An employee has been a no call / no show for the past 2 weeks. She has not responded to our requests to contact us. We do not have an Emergency Contact family member or friend to contact as an alternative. How should we handle this matter? Do you have a sample job abandonment letter that you can send me?	
5	We have an employee who was terminated on Friday, today he brought back his uniforms and put them in the locked box, so we cannot verify what/how much he returned. That step didnt happen. Usually, we verify what is returned and deduct it from their final pay, but in this case, we cannot make a determination.

He came in at 8:30 this am, wrote the letter at 9:00, saying we agree there is not enough work, hes been absent due to health reasons, little production work, and he should seek work outside of the company.

4	I am a Great Clips Franchisee in Ft Worth, Texas. Here is the background of the situation. The person involved is our Operations Manager. She was ineffective, & we met in late November & I informed her we were dissolving her position. Mid-December she came back with Resigning to take care of her Father (75 years old, recovering from West Nile Virus) She is 53, and has worked for the company since 2006 Jan 5th, I announced her resignation via email effective Jan 31st Her resignation is verbal, we have nothing signed as documentation. She is taking this week as PTO/Vacation. The plan (pending your input) is to give her Vacation pay thru 1/27. & remove all job responsibilities immediately. Last Thursday we discovered she probably had been manipulating data to increase the size of her monthly bonus. The evidence is only circumstantial, however. I would like to have a conversation, & then document the above plan with her. The manipulation of data for the bonus would not be a part of the conversation. I would like just a clean break from her. How can we protect ourselves in this ? 1) Can we record phone conversations with her ? 2) Do we need written resignation as opposed to verbal ? Is my e-mail announcing it adequate, as she has not disputed it? How to hold her to a verbal resignation. 3) What should be the content of the conversation to inform her of our plan? 4) What do we say when asked about references or possibility of return to our company? i.e. how to avoid saying anything 5) Paid time off. 6) FMLA impact of the above. Please let me know when you can call to discuss... Mark Blessing A Great Clips Franchisee 214-212-4599

1	Hi, I have another question. If we fire any employee due to downsizing, is it correct that we can not hire anyone within 3 months? I have to let one employee go due to the rising labor cost (increased minimum pay), we should be okay with the staffing. However, our business is seasonal and always changing. I just want to know in case the business needs more labor due to the increased business column, when are we able to hire someone new to help. Also, do you have any recommendations in terms of wording on how to tell the employees that we have to let her go due to the rising labor cost (increased minimum pay in Sunnyvale)? What's the best practice? Thanks, Catherine >

3	Hi, We have a long term employee (8 years) who has caused a lot of problems in the past and has at least two HR harassment complaints on record that were dealt with ThinkHR help. Investigated, noted and closed. Last one in 4th quarter 2016. There has been an incident where the long term employee was very unprofessional with a new hire in the way he spoke about our company, stating that the new employee should quit while he is ahead. Stating that Eigen is a very late pay on reimbursements and in general bad-mouthing our company. Upon completion of training, the new hire complained directly to his supervisor of the unprofessional long term employee behavior. My plan is to terminate the long term employee by Friday the 13th of January. My concern is how best to do this legally and precisely as this employee will definitely come back and try to sue Eigen. Thank you as always for your help. Maryann

4	A part-time employee who has worked for us less than 6 months has an ongoing health issue that prevents her from showing up to work. She's had the condition prior to hire (however she didn't disclose it), and it's not controlled. We did grant her accommodations twice (less hours/day, less days/week) but she still calls out or has issues at work that are quite serious in nature. Because she's insistent on keeping her job, we finally asked her to not return to work until her doctor completes a form stating she is able to do her job. How long do we have to wait for her to return before we can move to termination?	
4	New hires are placed on a 90-day probationary period. One employee is not working out, and she also came to us to say that she does not feel this is right for her. Must we maintain for full 90 days, Can we let her go now, and could it be a resignation?	
3	employee accused of stealing off the job, our obligation to victim? they just want laptop returned. Should we fire employee? The person was accepted to our training program but was let go. The uniform was not collected. The police came to our offices with information that someone in a second chance uniform was found with items that were not his. A representative from a company from which this person stole, has video that shows it was one of our employees.	
6	How do I handle elected payroll deductions when an employee leaves? IRA and health insurance. We pay that ahead of time (a month in advance). Do we deduct all the way through?	
6	I have an employee that just resigned and when we hired this person 7 months ago we gave him a bonus. It was a contingent bonus. He signed condition of bonus. I would like him to repay the bonus. Do I have to ask him to re pay or can we deduct from final pay? $5000 bonus net is $3800.00. Employee is in NJ. The final check will be a bit over $5000.00	
1	We have a former employee that emailed us 8 months after he resigned with a list of charges from his credit card, exported to Excel, that he said we owe him for unpaid expenses going back three years. There are multiple issues with this outlined below. 1. During employment, he submitted expense reports monthly or more and we have payed everything that was submitted. So that means that none of these expenses were previously submitted. (We will be performing an audit to make sure of this.) 2. Many of these are chargeable expenses, meaning we billed them to the clients for reimbursement. Since they were not submitted, they were never sent to the clients. These projects are closed so we can no longer bill the client. Because of his lack of following procedure, we would be out this money. 3. Per our expense policy, we require receipts for charges greater than $15. Assuming he would not be able to produce many of them, would we be required to pay them? What are our options?	
4	At our summer camp, one of the counselors has Tourettes Syndrome and has been ticking more than usual to the point she is leaving early or not coming in on a daily basis. The camp director believes it is time to release her as she cannot perform her basic job duties and her ticks have become inappropriate for camp. We are waiting for the documentation to come over for what reasonable accommodations have been made to reduce her stress level to manageable, and more information as to when she left the camp or had to be sent home. Please advise what we would be missing to terminate her employment. Thank you.

3	I needed some guidance on properly completing the notice to employee of change in relationship form. What should I put if the employee voluntarily terminates? What about if they are discharged?	
5	We have an employee who is a supervisor and has been with us for 9 years and his regular job includes clinical responsibilities and has to keep his BBS certification (certification to do counseling, licenses clinicians, etc.). With the contracts we have they require that in order to do clinical work a certain level of certification is required and it must be kept up to date (it generally expires every few years). Unfortunately his certification expired February 28th of this year because they added a new requirement that involved taking a test and he did not pass the test. Therefore his certification expired and we scrambled in March to try to figure out what to do. During March we said you can't do the clinical work so focus on the non-clinical part for now. We consulted with the contractor funding his position and they said there is a 90 day period before he takes the test again. The contractor said he is no longer eligible and he can't remain in his position. We came up with a special assignment position beginning April 1st and the contractor agreed to it for a limited period of time. That period of time is up Monday, July 31st. Between April and end of July he needed to accomplish certain things to obtain his certification. He claimed he completed the class and would get scheduled for the retake test. That was all supposed to be accomplished on June 30th but he was hospitalized with an infection in early/mid June and was released July 7th and the doctor who released him returned him to work effective Monday, July 10th but he wasn't well enough to return. He couldn't get his primary care physician or specialist to write him a note. We said you don't need a doctor's note to stay home, you can take paid leave or vacation. He did that and then came into work on July 13th and he tried to work part of the day (he is exempt) through the 19th of July and then contacted me on the 20th and said he couldn't do it and was getting sick again. He went to a specialist and produced a doctor's note that placed him out through August 4th and returned him to work August 7th. Now the problem is that his position ended July 31st and so I am struggling because he has been here long enough to offer FMLA and CFRA. We don't have an alternate position to place him in. Do we need to wait until he comes back to take action or can we say it now? If it is correct that we keep him on board until the 7th, what happens then? We don't have anything else available to place him in. We are about to post another supervisory position that he was hoping to apply for but it requires the same certification and he still doesn't have it nor is he likely to have it August 7th.	
3	I'm trying to fill out a notice of unemployment claim filed.

3	We have a developing scenario involving the elimination of a job position, currently filled by an employee on FMLA. Our employee started intermittent FMLA on June 27, 2017. Although it was intermittent FMLA, the employee has been out continuously since the FMLA began. While out on FMLA, the employee experienced a second, FMLA qualifying event on July 18. The second event is a medical concern that will qualify the employee for Short Term Disability. While the employee was out on FMLA, major restructuring changes were made which affect the employees department; staff will be reduced from 3 full time and 1 part time employee, down to just 2 full time people. The manager wants to eliminate the part time employee, and the FMLA employee. Is it permissible to terminate an employee who is on FMLA, due to the job being eliminated? Are there any special considerations we must take into account, with regard to which of the 3.5 employees are termed, beyond normal considerations?

3	Hi, I have a specific question regarding the ADEA list provided to employees age 40+ who are being laid off. If the company had a layoff in July and those employees have left the company, should their names still be included as "affected" even when they are no longer employees? OR should their names be excluded meaning only those "active" and affected/unaffected be included on the ADEA list? I'm hoping to hear from you today since the notification for the layoff of 1 person is tomorrow. Thanks! Angeli avallandigham@blurb.com 415-786-3112	
3	BayTech Team Hi ThinkHR, BayTech Team, an IT Consultant firm, has an employee who recently provided negligent service to one of their valued clients. By negligent service is during an urgent IT crisis, the EE elected to do no work for over an hour while the client was virtually connected to Baytech's portal, hence the client could see no activity from the EE although he was logged in and claiming that he was attempting to resolve the issue. The client was so upset that they requested a meeting w the owner and stated they were close to terminating their contract, the responded to the client in a derogatory tone, which further exacerbated the client. This EE was placed on a performance probation about 8 months ago and his work ethic (arriving late, low productivity) has continued to decline. This latest episode has caused BayTech Team to want to fire the EE, however they want to be sure they are within the right regs to do so. Any further guidance that you can provide would be greatly appreciated by this Maryland Small employer (<20ees). Thanks!!

5	It's regarding an employee termination in Texas. We conferenced in Shane Stringfellow from Jet Engine Solutions. Employee was hired 2 years ago, as a technician. He worked in the large commercial side originally, and started strong, then he made two pricey mistakes, due to negligence, and got written up. Then the 3rd mistake happened and they wanted him terminated. I interviewed him and he felt he was under a lot of scrutiny. I agreed to transfer him to my side and watch him, and put him on a 6-month probation. He's been with me for 12 months now. The first 6 months he did great, then things started going south. Punctuality and attendance is terrible. He has exhausted all his paid time off and now he is take time off unpaid. During his evaluation, we warned him of the attendance problem. In the past 4 months, he started taking long lunches every day. A couple weeks ago, he commented to lead, "I wish I could go part-time or, better yet, be fired so I can collect unemployment". Do I have grounds for termination? He is a minority and I don't want to get hit with a discrimination claim. He filed for disabled vet benefits under VA. It must have come through for him. He wants to go to school.

Rick factors: Race, age, etc.	
5	We have not been happy with the Director's communication with employees etc. He contacted us saying he would not be in to work on Friday. On Monday there was a meeting he was scheduled for and he did not show up. We found out later that he was in Jamaica to care for his mother and did not know when he would be back. The director gave him my cell phone number and he left a message. He has been gone all week and we have had no response. Normally, this would be job abandonment. This is a little bit of a different scenario. I do have an email from him right afterwards last Monday. He said he was logged in at an internet Cafe and that if documents needed to be signed to contact him by phone. We have attempted to call and email multiple times to ask him for details on his request for leave, however we have not heard back.

5	One of our employees is currently in a rehab center due to drug/alcohol/.gambling addiction. He has been placed on non-FMLA leave but did not return the leave of absence form that I gave to his father to give to him. During our investigation, we learned that the employee had been misappropriating company funds over an extended period of time. This has been evidenced through email correspondence, and the employee admitted to this to his father, who shared the admission with us. The father is asking for us to give his son another chance, and the father would pay us back. We cannot agree to that, and will move forward with the termination. Do you have a sample termination letter that we may use? Should we have legal review this matter? Can I ship the employee's personal belongings to his home address?	
2	Is there a law in New York to provide terminated employee's with a notice of termination?

4	An employee has had a lot of "always something" issues. Today she had car issues. She came to me on Thursday if Collins Vision could provide a loan to her because she found out her drivers license was suspended and needed money to pay to have her license reinstated. What is our obligation there? Our stance on the loan is that we do not want to get into a loan situation. We also have had some theft at the front and we have a suspicion that it could be her. We have an uneasy feeling about here and would prefer not to have her here anymore.	
5	We have an employee who was hired on the condition that he would pass a certification he has failed thee times now. Looking at other options. An employee moved from Oregon to Utah, and the position was contingent on passing the probation period and passing the certification test. He will be here a year tomorrow. We allowed him three chances to pass the test. He cannot perform the role without the certification. We modify the role until the certification is passed. We have no other openings in another position he would be qualified for. The last time he took the test we made it pretty clear that we would not be able to continue allowing him further chances to pass the certification. What about if we were to put him on leave until he passes?

6	An employee resigned in the state of Colorado. Can we pay him via direct deposit on the next schedule pay day?	
5	It looks like he has been careless or negligent previously. He lost a binder which was later returned, but the money was lost. I think we are just going to make it a warning for not handling company property properly. They never put a dash cam back together, the car was broken into and it was stolen. He was on a final warning.	
3	Is it ok to let an employee go earlier then their three week notice. We have a replacement who wants to start right away and so cannot accommodate both the drivers for the same routes.	
4	We have a claim from the EDD for an ex-employee. She was let go because we have video of her stealing from the company. She was an employee for 30 years and she filed a claim for unemployment and put as the reason for separation that the employer said she wasn't honest. We are okay with her getting paid but aren't sure how to respond because we don't want it to appear that we fired her for an invalid reason either.	
2	Employee resigned immediately without notice. When is termination pay due?	
2	What forms are required at termination in California?	
5	We are planning on a termination for poor performance (issues are well documented). The employee has recently called in sick, "injured hand due to overuse." He plans to be back tomorrow.

I know that sick time is not required to be paid out, but was not sure on the time allotted to pay out regular vacation. Does it have to be paid out at the time of final check/termination?	
4	We terminated someone a bit ago for brandishing a loaded firearm in the workplace. We gave her final pay the next day, for termination with cause. Shes saying we owe so much for overtime and wants the amount for the month. She lives with her boyfriends Mom, who works for us. We gave her the final pay through the boyfriend's moms the next day. Additionally, this employee had not cashed several of her checks. On Friday, when we terminated her, she apparently went to the bank to cash all of the uncashed checks, and we had had a problem wiring the money to our account for payroll that week. So, given that the employee had held the checks and tried to cash them all at once, there wasnt sufficient funds. We processed and sent a cashiers check to her via the boyfriends mom, so we ensured she was paid properly. She had her money within a couple of hours and its a done deal. She is threatening to go to the labor board to file a claim against us. We have several questions: Did we pay her correctly for her final pay? Is there liability about the two hours and her not being able to cash her previously unpaid checks immediately? Do we have other liability, shes requesting 30 days of overtime pay. (We believe she has been paid accurately.)	
1	Please give me a call, I have a few follow-up questions. (386) 216-3233 We have only 3 employees in the store that will remain open, one of them is getting terminated today due to a workplace violation, and the others are a manager and a clerk. So, the clerk is the only employee who will be laid off. The store that is closing has only one clerk, one driver, and one assistant manager. All of them will be transferred to the other store. So, I believe that I will give 60 days notice to the one clerk who will be laid off, based on least seniority, correct? Must I still notify the government agency?	
5	We have a teammate who falsified his timesheet by stating that he worked until 4:30 pm but the Manager of his dept. saw his company truck an hour away from his job site at 2:59 pm. When asked by the manager what time he left the jobsite he initially said 4:00pm and then changed to 3:30 pm. When he was told by the manager that he saw his truck at 2:59 pm an hour away from the jobsite he said that wasn't possible. It wasn't him. The manager talked to a mechanic who was at the jobsite and he thought he saw the truck leave the area at approximately 2 pm. This sounds like grounds for termination --Code of ethics and misrepresenting hours on timesheet. He has not been warned about this before though. Should there be an escalated disciplinary process? He is over 50 years old. Your thoughts on this matter? Thanks Michelle Hennessey 603-328-2371	
6	Just wanted to confirm the amount of penalty a company must pay if late on a final check.	
3	When someone does not show up for their shift and we consider it a No Show/No Call is that a voluntary or involuntary resignation? Is there a certain amount of days?

We took him to the industrial clinic for treatment including x-ray. He went back the next day and the x-ray was clear, he was released to work. We had previously attempted to talk him into not resigning but now would like for him to hold to his previous resignation.	
5	I have an employee who has been with us - the shop supervisor - I found out that he was in a company vehicle when he was at home and that he told our VP he was drinking beers and went to the store. This statement came to me because that vehicle had some drug paraphernalia in it. I asked our VP for a statement and I am ready to terminate him. I was trying to pursue that allegation and I found out told 4 other people the same story: the owner's son (with the VP), two coworkers (together). The supervisor is suspected of being the owner of the drug paraphernalia because he was using the vehicle. But he was the one who reported the drugs. The issue is this happened 12 days ago and has just been brought to my attention. He's he been with the company since 2004. When this came to light they decided not to do anything and now they want to get rid of him. I feel my management team has lack of management skills and I am cleaning all of their bloopers. They want him terminated today. How clean can I present it to the employee?

5	An employee has been working with the company for 7 years as a driver in Florida. Our insurance carrier told us we could't allow him to drive for us due to information on a report they ran but they couldn't tell us. He said he were going through clearing his identity. We moved him to another position but it's been a burden because we need a driver. We reached out and he said there's no update to his ability to drive so we gave him a deadline. The truth came out that he was undocumented when 2 managers were speaking with him. What should we do?

This was last Friday. When an employee test negative on these, we take a photo to include in their medical portion of their file. We haven't received results and not sure he went. My concerns are, we should report this to the Union as they have programs in place to assist the employee. However, is this protected under HIPPA/Privacy acts? Which brought to mind should we also have a disclosure on our consent form so that we can report to the union?	
1	We are processing a termination of employment today for an employee with on-going performance short-falls and attendance.

4	We hired a front office staff a month ago and she is not catching on - we're an at-will state. We gave her 6 hours of extra training last week. We can just let her go, can't we? We could give her a written warning and give her a while, but its just going to delay things longer. We over hired but that is not the reason we are letting her go. She is very defensive about training and seems anxious but we are not aware of an ADA issues. What happens if she claims a disability during termination?

We suspended him, pending review and he admitted that he had smoked some pot over the weekend. The results came back showing negative and they did not test for alcohol.

1	We are an electrical contractor and we work with a union. During slow times we lay employees off and they can go back to the union hall for work, we call them back when we have work. This is per the CBA. We have one employee who is pregnant. She has expressed through the union that she would like to stay home and on disability and not be included in the lay off, but that would mean that she would not be subject to callback if we have the ability to call people back. We are not sure what we should do, we have had people sue us in the past because we did not call them back.

1	Hello. My company issued our first employee handbook in April of 2016. In November, 2016, we amended it to reflect a change in the PTO policy, as well as a few other minor changes. We all remember having the team sign an acknowledgement, but can't seem to find those forms. We have an employee leaving, and we want to e sure we are calculating the PTO payout properly (she should be getting less as a result of the handbook changes). Can we base the PTO off of the addendum, even if we can't find the acknowledgement? I do have an email that was sent after the informational meeting about it with the addendum attached, and she was a recipient of that email. Thanks in advance!	
4	Termination. We intended to let this person go on a specific day and walk them out. We would like to now give her notice that her last day will be August 11th. We would like to offer for her to stay on for an additional a week. We are expanding and she is working part-time, she is a 60 year old woman. We have employees that range from 50 to 69. She was hired to do a minimal skill job as a fabric librarian. We have expanded this job to full-time and we want a person to design, market, sell and do the fabric librarian part; her job would be rolled into the larger scale job. She is not qualified to do this new job. We are hiring a 68 year old man with 40 years of experience in the business. We have now realized that being told that today would be her last day would be inhumane. Our intention is to provide severance. We have a check for her today if she chooses to leave. If I were to terminate with or without cause and she accepts to stay until August 11th would we need to provide her her final pay today? What if she decides to stay until August 11th?

3	We have an employee who we terminated. I am not really sure how unemployment works as it relates to the effect on the employer. We do not have to pay extra for this right? This is what we are taxed for? Why would an employer try to fight the granting of unemployment benefits?	
5	Follow up to July 11 issue: We placed the employee on a performance improvement plan. We also have allowed him to work from home as a reasonable accommodation. In the 90 days that he has worked here, he has written only 2 articles for our company, and the last article he wrote is not even about our company's products or services. He has had 16 family emergencies in 90 days that have impacted his attendance and work performance. We are going to terminate him. Can we discuss the risks?

0	A couple of our employees have resigned. They have used their entire PTO allowance for the calendar year. Since they will not be working the full year, by the time they leave, they will owe money for the overused PTO. Our policy states the following: "Upon termination of employment, employee will be compensated for earned but unused vacation and sick/personal days, on a pro-rated basis, and may be required to reimburse the Bank for any unearned but utilized vacation days and sick/personal days." We, therefore, have two questions: 1.) May we go ahead and deduct as many hours as possible from the employees final paycheck? and 2.) If the employees does not work enough hours to cover the owed PTO, may we send a letter requesting reimbursement? Should the requested amount be the net amount, or gross amount? Would you be able to provide a sample letter to be sent? Thank you very much!

4	situation: We have a new employee hired in March of this year. SHe passed her probationary period, however, now has started missing 1 day a week of work; she is an assistant Insurance Underwriter. The UW she assist is constantly behind due to lack of support. The big boss herself has personally done this girls work to get them both caught up, only to heave this employee call in sick, stating car issues the following week. thus once again, everyone falls behind. she's been warned verbally. she's been warned via written warning. Today again, out with car issues even though her co worker has offered to give her a ride! This cannot continue. We are an at will employer, I believe we have enough at this point to legally let her go? if we choose to keep her on a tighter leash, what can we do? can we put her back on probation? give her notice to improve or be termed? say 30-45 days? the writing is on the wall. she's just not going to work out.

1	We have an employee that we were planning on RIF'ing. It is really a re-organization of tasks and therefore eliminating the position.

I am planning to lay another three employees off indicating that it is due to the slow season, and that they can file for unemployment benefits.

4	Regarding an employee termination or voluntary resignation. I have an employee in a manager roll who wrote out resignation 2 weeks notice. She placed it in supervisors office while the supervisor was on vacation. She did not speak to anyone about it. When the supervisor came back and found the note there was only a few days until last day. The supervisor and manager had meeting...they decided to release her that day before the 2 weeks notice. We were going to ask her work the rest of day and fill out all separation paperwork at the end of the day. She decided to leave and asked for us to just email her the paperwork. If employer does not have them wait out notice, is it no longer voluntary resignation?

I have a signed policy by her that the occurrence. For doctors notes, they wouldnt be counted? She is saying she cannot legally be terminated, due to this. She is also pregnant and is an on-call employee without regular hours. She provides care in a care facility to our clients. She is on lifting and other restrictions due to the pregnancy but has not missed any work due to her pregnancy. Can we still terminate her? (Issue 1 of 3)

4	We are looking for HR guidance for a layoff/termination/resignation. We are a non-profit. We are a non-profit and want to eliminate the current program manager. We are considering allowing her to resign rather than being let go. This is a performance issue, the employee is aware of the issue. She is on one written warning in 4/28/17, prior to that there were verbal conversations and back and forth emails. She was making too many mistakes for this position, doesnt have the skillset to do this job. She holds access to some things that I dont have access to. Also, we would like her to wrap up some projects prior to her last day. How might we go about this? (Issue 1 of 3)

5	I have a salaried employee who worked from 7/1-7/12. He took a couple days off in between. He came back 7/17 and gave his resignation. Do I need to pay him through the 17th? He had no accrued time yet since he was new. Exempt employee. They were having personal issues and they gave him some time off. He did not perform any work that day. On the 17th he came in, clocked in and gave his resignation.	
1	Key employee resigned with two-month notice. We have had someone else in that same department give us 6-month notice in the past. His direct report is asking for us not to accept the 2-month notice because he didn't care enough to have the other guy step up and do work during the notice period.	
6	As a follow up to my earlier issue, if the exempt employee came in for an hour on his final day, would we need to pay for that day? What about the rest of that week if he was scheduled off for two days?

5	We let someone go who was within their 90-day introductory period. We felt it wasn't a fit. Some of the reasons we came to this decision include his attendance, complaints from the trainer, complaints from coworkers, his attitude all within the first month of employment. He's insisting we give him a reason and keeps requesting our CEO's phone number to discuss with him. He's also referenced getting his attorney involved. Do we need to give him a reason?	
1	Our organization will be laying off an employee. We have had a management change and new management does not see this employee as an appropriate fit for the organization. There is not substantial evidence in terms of write ups or disciplinary actions in the file, nor is the position title different from other positions similar to theirs. Can we terminate based on position elimination alone? Or are we not able to terminate this employee immediately?

0	An Illinois employer has a vacation policy stating "Employees who have completed one year of continuous service are eligible to use vacation time. Regular, full-time employees accrue vacation time as the following schedule indicates: [accrual schedule]" In practice, this vacation time is only available to the employee (e.g. awarded) upon the employee's anniversary date. When an employee leaves, how much vacation time must the employer pay out? Would it be just the amount available to the employee as of the date of separation or would it also include the amount the employee has accrued since his last anniversary date, even though it's not available? For example, an employee with 3 years of service earns 10 vacation days per year. If that employee leaves at 3 years & 6 months, how much vacation time must the employer pay: 10 days or 15 days?

May we give her final check, have her cash it and pay us back the $2500? What other options are available?

We only have 18 employees at that branch, so we were not required by law to offer any type of FMLA, etc... The manager had agreed to allow her this extra time, she is planning on coming back February 1st, but the manager wants to move her to a different dept. When the employee asked if she had a choice he said no, either you take the new position or we have no place for you. So, I need to know if we have any legal obligation to give her her previous position back since it is still open. And of course the manager did not speak to me prior to talking to the employee....

Our reason for termination was "not a good fit" after having counseled her on various company violations in the past. How should I create this service letter? She wants this to go to a PO Box, not her regular home address. Should I send it to the PO Box or her home address? We believe she is working with legal counsel.

The boyfriend came in hostile and aggressive and got in the employee's face. He then left with our employee while she was still on the clock. The manager made sure the customer was taken care of. The employee said the boyfriend gets really upset and doesn't care who he hurts. The employee said we shouldn't say anything because he has had run ins with the law and doesn't care. "You don't want to get him mad because he could hurt you." The employee talked about drug use in the conversation. She shows up late and there have been other issues. She is clearly not a good fit for the salon.

He is taking a lot of sick leave. We planned to terminate on 8/7 were in the process of putting together a package. Then we found out he is going to have surgery on 8/7 and will take two weeks off to recover. We are concerned that termination after his return will appear to be related to illness. The company has unlimited PTO, with no accrual. The state has SDI and we also have LTD. At a certain point, the employee can take SDI. We suggested that but he doesnt want to take SDI. We are sponsoring his H1-B visa.

4	An employee has had a series of incidents over the last 6 months. She has been on a PIP the last 6-9 months. She has poor relationships throughout the company and people do not want to work with her. A manger sat with her and wanted to terminate her for poor performance.

1	Two employees in IL at two locations. Our employees sell rugs inside one of our customer's stores. The store will no longer be offering rugs and therefore, those positions will be eliminated. Right now it's tentatively slated for the end of the month. However, nothing has been finalized. These employees are married and leaving for a two week trip back to Pakistan. We are concerned they will be on vacation when the final decision is made. We had planned to give them two weeks notice but now concerned they may not get that much notice. Any thoughts?	
5	We are dealing with an employee issue. I have an employee on 7/7/17 who had to submit to a drug test in order to work at a specific plant. The collector said the sample was cold and told the employee to wait in the waiting room and drink water until he could give another sample. He was told that he had to give an observed sample. The employee just left. At our site, that is like raising his hand saying he cant pass. He got in our truck and left, the dispatcher thought he voluntarily resigned, but no one else knew and no action was taken. He didnt show up for work on that next Monday or for the few weeks after. But, he called this Monday (the 31st of July) to say he has a back injury and wants to file a workers compensation claim. He has not been technically terminated, voluntarily or involuntarily. During the time missed, on Monday, he said hes been too sick to come to work. We have proof he has been using our company credit cards during this time for hotel charges in Florida (we are located in MI). We show multiple unauthorized charges to company credit card by him. History regarding the employee, I had sent him through rehab for marijuana in 2015. Hes been with us for over 10 years and helped us build our business and has in the past been a great employee. When I talked with him, and was finally able to reach him this week, he yelled and was defensive to me. This is not the same person I hired, he was definitely acting differently. When I talked with Zurich about his termination, they said we should file a workers comp claim, but we want to terminate. We want to terminate his employment immediately. Would we process a voluntary or involuntary termination? Would we have to file a workers comp claim?	
1	Q2- We may need to let go or reduce payroll a little bit. Would like to talk about offering employees to go on a furlough stay on benefits but would not accrue PTO or any other benefits. It would give us a chance to see if work comes in. We just went through layoffs on July 6th - all impacted people were in Portland. Our company is 73, we have 24 we may need to impact. One option is that we may want to consider furlough. How does that work? Are the specific templates? The employees are in Portland. Would this trigger WARN? What does partial unemployment mean for our UI account in Oregon?

2	Is there a difference in severance versus involuntary termination? Does severance have to be given with a waiver? Waivers have over age 40 requirements? If we do not provide a severance agreement the person can file claims? This individual signed an expectation document (PIP). There is documentation that those requirements were not meant - is that sufficient to mitigate risk?	
2	Possible termination for cause - executive level position. If I say, term for cause, can I quote the employment agreement? Do I have any obligation to inform the employee of the exact reason? Im trying to get the company to move forward with a mutual separation agreement. The owner feels the employee agree to this and is now back tracking and saying he will take this to the board of directors. The owner feels that threat would be considered insubordination. Is this insubordination and therefore grounds for termination?	
4	We have an employee who texted a month ago and stated that she could not work due to an injured arm. We did not get the appropriate forms from her at that time, we have not heard from her and she's ready to return to work. We have not heard from her in a month, can we terminate.	
5	(With Tatiana Johnson): We have an employee who we terminated July 27th and he has company tools, parts, and material, and paper work and a few other things. What is the best way to recover our property? He took an advance of $900-plus and his final wages was only $600. He still owes $2500 on tools he bought on the company credit card. In addition, he took without us knowing, his truck's tools and inventory. He was terminated for reasons no connected with this. He pulled a GPS out of a van and destroyed it in the process, which was the reason for termination. He's been very aggressive - screaming in the office. He requested a week off and he left anyways. On his way home, he took the truck apart and ripped up the GPS and threw it away. We called him and asked for the truck so we could fix the GPS. We picked up the truck and this is how we were notified the GPS was destroyed intentionally. He gave back the keys and the ladders. We found the truck was stripped when we opened the truck $6,000. The repayment for the tool account is $30 every check and there is a written agreement and the last check is supposed to be held in full if something is missing. I know we have to pay the minimum wage. Advances are separate. The advance for wages is in a written policy. They ask for advances almost every week. We have written policies. An attorney reviewed our policies after an EEOC claim said our practices are legal. He was notified by another employee that we realized everything was gone, which is a felony charge. He texted Daron that he has the stuff and needs to return it. How do we proceed - we can send him a list of everything he has or send two people to go there and take the stuff. Or, make the exchange and have something for him to sign that "we're cool." He is African American and has thrown around the word "discrimination." It's unlikely he would be violent. I want to send him a list so he can gather it. What do we do if we pick the items up or ask him to come back here - should we have an agreement or call the police?	
5	Could you please guide us to know what to do with an employees paychecks. He recently passed away and no one has POA of his account.

6	If an employee owes the company money from a past overpayment in payroll, can the entire amount be recouped in their final paycheck?	
2	Do you have a sample "Company Assets" letter that discusses employee's requirement to return keys, etc upon separation, with the potential for recovery costs?	
1	We had an employee on leave for health reasons for approximately one month. We provided ADA accommodation paperwork which he never returned. We received a few weekly doctors notes and a full release to work. Can we terminate based on the various attendance occurrences? Typically, our next step would be termination.	
5	We have an employee whose essential job duty is to drive. He got a DWI over the weekend, and will not be sentenced for 7 days. He has his license right now. He had another DWI 10 years ago and this one may result in a suspended license or jail time. If his license is suspended are we able to terminate his employment?	
3	If an employee is terminated from the company and the company term policy is end of month. What can the company do if the termed employee does not have enough money in their final paycheck to cover the remaining portion of the monthly insurance premiums. Can the company ask the termed employee for the $$ or is the company responsible for paying the remaining amount of insurance premiums.	
6	An Indiana employee left and owes us a considerable amount on the employee account. He signed an agreement giving the company permission to withhold payments and the balance from his final wages. The amount owed exceeds his final wages. Do I have to leave him at least minimum wage?	
3	XXX will be terminating the employment of employee as soon as possible. It is a termination for cause misconduct and violation of his employment agreement. Employee is a resident of Texas. Is there anything special that needs to be done for termination? Client's Question : do we need to do anything special for the state of TX and what day do I have to pay him through? The $2,500 salary would be his pay through the 10th. If pay him through Thursday, the 10th, which is the end of the pay period, his salary amount would be $1,250	
4	We have an employee who started with me as a part-time employee. Shes been here 2-3 months. Yesterday I got a notice for her unemployment due to reduction of hours. She has been working 18-20 hours. In talking with her, I said I would use her 2-3 weekdays and at least one weekend day. About 70% of the time, she comes late and she has been given verbal warnings. Everyone who works with her knows that she is almost always 30-45 minutes late and she has not shown up two times. So In the last 9 shifts, she came late 5 times and one time she called off. Today she was late again by more than 30 minutes. Today we are going to give her a write up. She has incurred more than 4 points. Four points means termination according to our policy. We want to talk about the situation and writing her up or terminating her.	
5	An employee was suppose to be terminated on Friday, but the manager did not do so. His check was sent overnight and should have arrived on Friday. However, the employee came in today and worked 4 hours. He was then let go today. Do we have to pay him the 4 hours?	
1	A sales employee wants to give their two week notice. We would rather let them go earlier.	
3	Q1- We have 2 paid interns last day Thursday the 10th. Our payroll doesn't process until the 15th. Should I write them a check, or have the direct deposit for the 15th or ask them their preference? Q2- We pay them hourly- we are paying them to date (they should be being paid 2 weeks prior) They started right before the 15th pay period so we paid them a week early. They have been being paid up to date. Should I not pay them the final week since they were paid early the first week they started?	
3	Good afternoon. Our company provides a service for a background screening company. A requirement of of the business arrangement is that all our employees must have background screenings. During the course of this process, it was discovered that a current employee had been convicted of child molestation in another state. He does not show up on the Missouri's data base. This employee works in our retail camera store and handles mush of our social media. What are our responsibilities in regards to his employment. Thank you

4	We recently terminated an employee who signed her termination letter/corrective action without reading it, by choice. If she asks for a copy of it, are we required to give it to her?	
3	Follow up to previous inquiry. We were unable to deduct the employee's full portion of benefit premium for the month of August, as she only worked 2 days and did not earn enough in wages. What are our options to collect the employee's responsibility for second half of the month's benefit premium? Can you draft a few sentences to explain this obligation to the employee.	
5	We had a salaried employee who was let go due to employee misconduct. For his final pay, he worked Mon - Wednesday (he was let go Wednesday evening). Do I have to pay him his full salary for the week or do I break it down into the 24 hours he actually worked that week.	
3	Hello! In the state of MA, if an employee leaves voluntarily, are we required to provide Unemployment documents upon resignation or is it only when they are separated from employment through no fault of their own ( i.e. involuntary termination, layoff, etc) Thanks	
1	I was hoping to talk through a situation with someone. We are potentially going to have to downsize and release 3-4 people over the next couple months. As we are taking a look at this, and determining where to start, just wanted to confirm what things to consider and document. We are looking at everyone within in the same job code. We have this position as several different locations. Over the last through years we have new technology which helps us to be more efficient. We are now at the point where we can see we are overstaffed. We have identified how many people per location we need to let go. We have two people we need to let go. If we looked at it from a performance standpoint, there are two people we have identified. It's not that they have been on a performance plan. It is a numbers-driven position. I will need to pull performance reviews before I go into a meeting with our VP.	
2	One of our employer groups is looking for a termination guideline checklist for Florida. Like an exit process upon termination. Is part of that process converting life AD&D?	
1	I'm in TN and we have to give a separation notice when terminating. It just goes to the employee. Is there any consequence if you don't give them this notice? If you give it them to late, is there any consequence to that? What happens if I forget to file it? Q-2 Another employee terminated for unsatisfactory.It was budgetary plus performance. We gave him severance pay, lump sum. I'm wondering how to word the reasons for separation? Budgetary constraints? We don't want to fight him on the unemployment.	
3	hello, can you please advise on this FMLA question, can an employer terminate an employee who is on FMLA and if not and they come back to work when can they terminate this employee? From: Talia Etienne Sent: Tuesday, August 8, 2017 4:00 PM To: Andrew Darrow; AJ Pennella Cc: Susan Orekie Subject: FW: PTO Hi Andrew Please see Rachels response below regarding Martha Carrera. Please advise. Thanks. Talia From: Rachel Friedman Sent: Tuesday, August 08, 2017 3:55 PM To: Talia Etienne Cc: Susan Orekie Subject: RE: PTO Ok, thanks. And where is she with FMLA? When will she have exhausted it? FMLA guarantees you your position back- the real question is whether we are able to terminate prior to her coming back. If the answer is no, what are our options once she comes back- is there a specific period of time we have to keep her on?	
4	I have an employee who has decided to move on. Friday will be her last day. She has been a good employee who we gently encouraged to move on and we want to pay her properly with the least amount of tax impact. She is leaving right before she would have been on vacation for a paid 10 days. Is there a specific process/letter/paperwork I should use?	
3	I have a group who has benefits enrollment ending the at the end of the month of termination. They had an employee whose last day of work was July 24th, but who then resigned as of August 4th. When would the employer have to end benefits for the employee?	
4	I have questions regarding the proper procedure for terminating an employee. She has been falsifying customer receipts. She submitted customer receipts indicating the customer used a coupon and I found out the customers confirmed paying full price. A few other employees tipped me off, and after reviewing a month worth of her receipts I noticed 75 incidents of coupons that were not attached to her receipts. The customers confirmed they did not have a coupon. So far, she owes me $650.	
2	Do you need to create a separation letter for an intern and have them sign it?	
4	We had an employee who was in my office three weeks ago for taking a 30 minute unpaid break, and she then indicated that she would need to take off time under FMLA. She came back into work today and refused to sign a release of medical information form. She is not qualified for FMLA because she has only worked for us for 2 months. We need her to provide a note from her doctor in order to continue her employment. If she does not provided a note can we terminate her?	
4	Employee submitted her resignation about two-three weeks ago. She said her last day, she was hoping, to be on the 18th and the new job starts on 21st. Supervisor reported it to me, and I asked for a resignation letter. I had not received it yet, so I reached out to the employee. She said I really don't know if it will be my last day. Im still waiting on clearances. She sent me a resignation letter that states a tentative date of Friday 8/18. My question, she resigned, tentative date waiting approval. We are in the midst of interviewing a replacement. What happens if we have to pick her termination date?	
1	An employee refuses to leave the property because we didn't give him a reason for termination. What can we do?	
2	We have become aware of the CA Labor Law 2808, which requires terminating employees receive information about continuing coverage for disability extension, workers compensation, etc. Are you aware of any specific language or forms in this regard?	
1	We called in previously about this theft situation. We were working with the local police department to investigate and one employee in particular has been pinpointed as the likely suspect. The detective has indicated they can perform a lie detector test as part of the on-going investigation. We are at the point we simply wish to part ways, on account of the detectives findings. Is this possible?	
5	We have a staff member who is still in his probationary period. We do not currently offer leave leave without pay. This employee has stated he is taking off today and there are some additional days he would like to take off in the couple of weeks. He said he needs this time for personal reasons. Do we have to accommodate this request?	
1	CA employee resigned with a weeks notice. We are trying to figure out notice times. When does the 72 hours start? What if he gave notice yesterday, would the weekend count toward the 72 hours?	
5	Caller Nate Hentges, send to Jeanette. Employee who about 5 months ago was sick and in and out of the hospital. Company laid him off due to downsizing. Now he is requesting a letter that he was medically unfit for the job. Considerations?	
2	Severence Agreement	
4	I'm going to terminate our receptionist for errors. I'm trying to decide if today or Monday would be better. I was planning on having our CFO in the meeting and the CFO is only here today. She has received a verbal and written for mistakes on invoices she sent out. The invoices were mailed to the wrong customer and there were quite a few mailed incorrectly. It was a handwritten envelope and appears to be her handwriting. My concern is she does not always tell the truth and she knows she is on the brink at this point. She may lie and say it was not her but she is the only one who sends out invoices.	
4	We have an employee who brought in a note for modified duty. We complied and put her in another job temporarily. She is doing a very poor job and we have spoken to her and gave her a warning. Can we terminate?	
3	It began to rain and the supervisor advised employees to go to shelter at the location and wait for the rain to stop then they would return to work. The employer was pouring concrete and stopped in the middle due to rain and would have to remain at work to finish the concrete job. Four stayed and six walked off and said you're forcing us to work in the rain we're leaving. They did not have permission to walk off the job.	
6	Several of the employees in one of our salons in PA walked off the job and stole product and took their employee files. What are the PA rules regarding final payment of wages, deductions from final wages for theft, and employee access to personnel files?	
3	Hired an employee 4 weeks ago who referred a former co-worker for hire who was hired. The employer received a FedX with a copy of a letter to the second employee we hired from the VP of HR of his former company which accuses the employee of taking company records, information and pictures that belonged to the company. How should the employer respond?	
0	Employee was not paid PTO at termination of 2.15. What should the employer do?	
6	An employee is scheduled to resign on 4/19. Under the company's current payroll frequency structure, the employee will receive a standard check next week but will then work an additional three days for which the employer will need to issue a final check. Since the amount of the final check will not cover the employee's benefit contribution responsibility for the month, is the employer permitted to deduct the employee's entire monthly premiums responsibility from not the final check but the check schedule for next week?	
3	Good morning! We have a client based in MD who has a question about benefit deductions once an employee who is leaving. The employee's last day of work for the company is this week and medical, dental, etc., benefits will run until the end of this month. The employees at this company get paid weekly. The contact at the group wants to know if they can deduct the remaining of the employee's contributions from the final check. This amount would technically be 3 times the normal deduction since they are normally deducted with each weekly check. Please let me know when you can. Thank you!	
5	I have multiple things going on here. I hired a stylist who walked into the store last Saturday. Tuesday we were short $27.00. Next day another stylist said $30 was stolen from her purse. Now he just worked Saturday and we were short $40 dollars. I have cameras and I saw him on camera stealing. He was supposed to work Sunday but we didn't call him to work. What do we need to do? Total from store is $47 and stylist is $30. Employees know there are cameras. The camera shows him putting the $5 on top of the $20. Can we release him at-will? Is it ok to show him the video? When I call him, if he disagrees, what do I do? I am 99% confident anyone will see he is pocketing the money in the video. The manager agrees. He wants to know when he can work again - can we delay his return?	
1	Giving references for a former employee. We have an employee we will be terminating because the position has been eliminated. What are we allowed to share in a reference?	
5	We had a re-hire tell us that he uses medicinal marijuana on a regular basis. Our employee work with boilers and the work is very dangerous. We have no drug testing policy, but we have some policy in our handbook that states that employees cannot work while impaired. Can we fired him? He's stating that we cannot discriminate against him because he has a medicinal marijuana card.	
6	We had an employee terminate last Friday. His health coverage goes through the end of the month. Are we okay to deduct from his last check the amount he owes for the remainder of the month employee contribution? Can we do this on a pre-tax basis?	
2	We are eliminating a position (outsourcing it) and considering offering a severance package which includes a release. Would you sen me a same document?	
2	HI, I need a sample company wide termination letter to present to our employees tomorrow. We sold our company but everyone will still be employed but under the new company. Do you have an samples we can edit accordingly regarding this situation?	
3	How can we fire an employee due to performance issues? Would the employee be able to apply for unemployment benefits? After the meeting that we document in writing, how can we defend that if the employee hasn't signed it?	
4	We terminated an employee due to poor attendance. We packed her belongings which she has already picked up. Unfortunately, we packed and she took a tablet that was issued by the client to one of the minors she worked with. It was properly collected from the minor but it was being held by your employee. It is technically property of the client. Can we call her and ask that she return it?	
3	CFO went out on stress-related LOA however she never returned the WC Claim so a claim was never filed claim however the employer did inform WC about the potential claim. Subsequently the employee was offered an alternative position as the employer could not accommodate a non-FMLA leave without undue hardship; the employee declined the alternative position. The employer has received a ER response to SDI and does not know how to notate the LDW. The leave date, the actual termination date or the date following the required 30 day notice in her contract. The CFO has retained an attorney to sue the employer for wrongful termination. What should the employer do?	
4	We're considering separation of an employee who has been with the company for about 15 years. We have found evidence that she has used the company credit card for unauthorized and personal purchases. These items are being delivered to her home. We are considering forgoing a police report and legal action if she will simply resign. The amount can be the $30,000 range. Can we establish an agreement whereby she will resign and waive her rights in exchange for us not filing criminal charges?	
4	I have an employee who is chronically missing work. Originally her absences were due to illness and now it's for other reasons.Reasons that we feel do not warrant a call-off such as she's sneezing. She's a good worker when she's here but she's not here enough. She has been absent over 16 days in the last 3 months since we hired her.	
3	An employer issues a form to separating employees that summarizes their final pay & benefit info. The form is issued in advance of the last day. The form states: "I also authorize employer to withhold_______ in unearned, used vacation hours from my remaining pay." The employer has used this form for years and it's unclear to new management why this line exists. It appears that this is for those instances where an employee has been allowed to take more vacation time than is in the leave bank (e.g. paid leave advance, "go negative," etc.) Is there any law, regulation, best practice, etc. that would necessitate such a line? Does the employer need authorization for such a deduction?	
2	What is the final pay requirement for Utah and is there a required termination form?	
1	We will be doing some reductions. Some employees will be offered a severance while others will be offered a stay bonus. Both will be paid in lump sum and under each option we are offering 1 week of severance or 'bonus' for each year of employment. Will either of these types of payments affect an employee's ability to collect unemployment?	
3	If a company has to lay-off some employees due to a decline in business, but then business starts rebounding months after the lay-offs, is the company required to first check with the former employees who were laid-off before re-hiring from other sources? And is there a time threshold after lay-offs (such as a year or two) during which a company must consider re-hiring previously laid-off workers before the company should re-hire from other sources? (Can a company get in trouble if it doesn't check with previously laid-off workers within a certain number of months after a lay-off and then starts re-hiring more workers from other sources?)	
4	One of our employees was caught stealing from a restaurant at a company sponsored event. Can we fire her for cause? There has been no arrest for conviction, but the restaurant provided us with surveillance video, and she had the stolen items in her bag at the office.	
6	(Spoke to Luis Miguel Flores as a courtesy - advised he needs to be added by broker) Our advisory board is asking us to hold off on an employee's final paycheck because they're trying to reconcile vacation an exempt employee took and did not report properly. Some how they got the employee to waive his right to his final paycheck by email. What are your thoughts?	
4	I terminated an employee today and gave her her final paycheck. She asked if mileage was on her paycheck. I told her I hadn't received a request but would pay her as soon as I got that. I got an email asking for 12 miles and I will take care of that. However, she also requested her paychecks to be sent via email versus not mail. I'm not terribly comfortable sending it via email. Can I just send them by mail anyway? If we have an online paystub system that she has access to can we just direct her there?	
5	We have a former employee who was terminated a couple of months ago. He has reached out to the president to talk about the termination. Should we call him back?	
5	When the doctor was on vacation we had another doctor came in to fill in. We paid him as contract labor. We ended it early because he was getting. No forms, no contract. They completed a W-9. We just told him to come in to cover 9-6 and when to take lunch and that we would pay a certain amount for the work. He filed an unemployment claim.	
5	In Michigan, at will employment state, but we have an employee who is litigious, and all but threatens us when things don't go his way. Unfortunately, he doesn't work up to 'par' but complains he is being singled out. What can we do to protect ourselves if we terminate his employment ?	
2	Is a translated Notice to Employee/Change in Relationship form that is translated in Spanish in compliance?	
0	I am calling about final pay for an exempt employee in Massachusetts. We have a policy that states that if an employee "borrows" vacation/PTO and this time is owed to the employee at termiantion, we will deduct for the amount owed. How can we deduct from an exempt employee's wages?	
1	We are going to terminate a manager with cause. We want to talk about severance agreements.	
5	We wish to terminate an employee who is underperforming. There is no write ups or verbal warnings. He is a sales team leader, and over the last couple months the sales team has dissolved. It is this employee, and ops person, and company owner. He no longer has a team to lead. He is not bringing in new business, but also not required to manage a sales force because there are no more employees. We would like to know the best wording or cause of termination. Management would rather use the lack of work for this particular position rather than performance. Looking for guidance on wording for termination. We are ok with paying unemployment, but want to mitigate risk for unlawful termination.	
3	One of my clients is a company of three employees. They are needing to terminate their Sales Team Lead/Manager as there is no longer a team to lead. In addition, this individual is not bringing in any business. How should the employer word the termination?	
3	We currently have an employee who is out on FMLA, and has stated that they will not be returning back to work. How long do we have to wait to cancel their health insurance, and other benefits?	
6	Employee gave notice, this Friday will be her last day. We will owe her this weeks pay. How soon do we have to get her the final wages?	
1	What is our recourse if an employee fails to return an access card to the building. We have asked the employee and we get no response.	
5	Employee provided 2 week notice and he was telling others why he was leaving and the company decided to release him prior to the final resignation date.	
0	We have a policy that any unused vacation time will be paid after an employee is terminated. Can we make it our policy that if the employee resigns but doesn't put in their 3 weeks notice than they are not eligible to receive their vacation paid out? This would not include terminations, just resignations...	
4	We have an employee for about a year and a half and we have had difficulty with her and we tried to work through it. We found some emails that were devastating. We have had her yearly review and we had not recommendations because she is so awesome. She and an ex employee were writing horrible things about us. We wanted to work with her because she had been such an asset to the company; but, since then it has been horrible. She tries to get rid of other employees or tries to get them to do things that Her hair is bothering her the fragrance of her hair bothers her and not she is having heart palpitations and has a doctor's note. She made a comment. We went out over the weekend and bought her a air purifier and the new employee said she would change her shampoo that she has used for 40 years and now she is stating that she just cannot continue to work with this employee. Can we legally let her go?

4	We recently had a layoff of 6 people (not a mass layoff), which includes both of the only 2 senior level managers left in that department and one of them is currently on maternity leave. The one on maternity leave asked if we could postpone her layoff until her maternity leave ends, as we aren't paying her anyway and this way she could delay her UI insurance claim for 2 months. I was wondering if there are any legal implications to postponing a layoff? I don't see any, but thought I'd double check.	
5	If an employee claims he was hurt on the job, but didn't tell anyone; goes to the VA for treatment, stays out from 5/15 and we find out he had been in the hospital with the injury and some other issues. I spoke with him on the phone and he said he was hurt at work. I told him he would have to be evaluated by our clinic to determine if he was hurt on the job. I didn't hear from him for about 2 weeks. I contacted him over and over and no answer to see if he would go to our clinic. He finally said he was available on 6/19 but after that I didn't hear back from him so I reached out again. I held his job open for him, but after he said there is not an expected date of return to work or to go to our clinic and not staying in touch; I terminated because we had a high priority unit that we were working on. He never reported this injury to a manager, safety or supervisor. Terminated on 7/21. What are the company's right with this issue. He has filed for unemployment.

5	cc- lbetz@turnerbrothers.com Additional information from previous call with Renee. It has since been discovered that they fired the employee on 7/26/17, due to previous agreement that if ever used drugs he would be terminated. His girlfriend indicated that he used drugs, so we terminated him via a conversation with the girlfriend. As we have filed a STD claimed we need to know how to stop that claim since he's been terminated.	
5	An attorney had discrepancies in his hours accounting. Can we adjust his final check down from 40 hours to 9 hours? Please call me tomorrow (Wednesday) to discus The attorney is exempt. The attorney enters the hours online and the grant releases funds for us to pay him. The supervisor researched and found there was a lot of discrepancies on his time the last two weeks he worked here. There was no work being done. He falsely put down information stating her performed work. She reported when he left his job site early, when he was supposed to be working 9 hours to make up for other missed time. They are classified as exempt but they are paid an hourly wage off the time sheet and they are deducted leave without pay (i.e. partial absences). The individual is paid by the hour but treated as exempt based on his profession. I instructed payroll to attach the document he can dispute with the final paycheck if he wants. They (management) also recommended against the payout of his annual leave, although he has an exemplary review on file. Can you send me the link with information?

Since the accident, he is still driving very fast and it shows he is typically driving 20 mph over the speed limit. We would like to terminate and would like a second opinion.	
5	I am preparing to fire an outside sales rep who has been working mostly out of his home for the past year, he has company property at his home that I need returned. I am trying to determine what the best way is to handle the whole process. Should I have him come in with all of the company property? (I would think he would then know he is being fired) Or should I have a meeting and then have him go get and return all of the company property? (Seems like such a waste of a drive)	
1	We have several payroll checks we keep getting returned. We have attempted to reach out to the former employees to get a most current address to send to or have them pick them up. We do have more than 100 employees, we believe that due to that we are obligated to report those checks as unclaimed or what is the best practice.	
1	We had four campuses at the end of last year and we when we ended the school year we knew that there was chance that might need to close one campus. We alerted all our teaches. We had a large number of teachers voluntarily resign as a result. We are now at the start of the school year and we will be closing one campus. We will need to lay off two teachers.	
1	We are located in multiple states: ND, WY anf Utah and are in the oil and gas industry. When employees start we often issue them a harrness and a H2s gase monitor at the company expense for the employee to use while employeed. Can we add a policy or statement to our hiring packet that indicates that if those items are not returned the specified amounts will be taken out ouf their last paycheck or pursue action to obtain payment?	
5	The client has a follow up question to the response below: Hi Hannah, Thank you for your help with this question. I would like to add on to this answer. The employee is going on his 30th year with the company and we are not going to let him go. So if we wait until he can come back to full duty whenever that may be, what are our options to help him retire? He is 71 years old and has been in and out of the hospital since 5/15/2017. How is that sort of situation usually handled in order to make sure it is a mutual agreement to retire and not go back and claim unemployment? Can we have them sign a document stating that they are agreeing to retire and receive the certain amount of bonus that the company will offer them? Hope this makes sense. Let me know if it doesnt and I can try to explain.	
1	We just started using Everify. We have a Tentative non-confirmation and the employee did not check whether or not they wanted to contest it. I was told by Everfiy that i need to have a policy in place before terminating an employee for these reasons. Do you have a sample template?	
2	I will be terminating an employee and am looking for guidance on the reason I should give him.

4	Has an employee they had to let go who is threatening to talk to a lawyer. We own a couple stores in San Diego and we are in Minnesota. The employee has had some personal issues with happens often. One time she was unable to get her shift covered. She had a panic during work in front of customers and she had to leave and she has been shaking during haircuts - another employee had to step in and finish the haircut. This weekend she was texting other employees and they got so freaked out because of what she was saying - one employee said her husband wouldn't let her come to work because of the texts. The manager decided it was time to let her go. I told the manager to have her not come in Sunday and come into Monday to meet with her. The employee asked if she was being fired and the managed confirmed and asked her to come in the following morning. She asked for a meeting Wednesday - I declined in a call on Sunday evening and told her she was no longer employed with us. She was slurring her words. She said the manager was horrible to her and screamed and lost it and she hung up on me. She came in on Monday and brought in her key and she would not sign the paperwork and refused to sign because she was talking to her lawyers and again asked for a meeting Wednesday. She got heated in the back room and the manager asked her to leave. She left and we found out after the fact she went to the restaurant next door and made a huge scene and was banging on the doors to get ice because the restaurant is as closed. They banned her from the restaurant. Today my manager received a text from her that stated she had not heard about the meeting with managers and owners and asked for paperwork to forward for her to sign to her attorney and added she had her medical paperwork and asked for a fax number to send it. It seems like she is going through a lot of stuff including not getting people to cover shift and the issues with the cuts. Are we on the right track? She said "I just can't cut hair right now, I just can't do it." They cut her hours down to 5-9 hours per week. I assume she exhausted her sick leave and she never said she had a disability. We never got any paperwork or brought in a note. I do not believe she was paid for the Sunday calls or the meeting on Monday - I don't believe she clocked in. I ran the final check through ADP on Monday and it will direct deposited sometime Wednesday. Should I cancel the ADP? I feel like she will be like - you did something wrong? Will that give her more fuel? Should we be having a meeting with her? She was so scattered and slurring and I could not get a coherent thought. She admitted to having a panic and shaking due to her husband getting out of jail Friday. Should I call her again and agree to a meeting? Should I send her the notice of separation? She wouldn't take the paperwork. Call back: 612-600-8107	
5	I called in April about a situation and I was wondering if you have the noted from that call? I thought I called on April 28th. Back in April a manager received a grievance email from a direct report - that she has been approached by peers that states she (the manager) has asked employees if they thought she has symptoms of a hangover (due to vomiting in restroom) and suspicion of alcoholism being raised. I spoke with the manager who explained her side of the story and recommended she meet with the employee and acknowledge his receipt of the email. He was violently vomiting in the bathroom and people talked. It happened to be a day they were all going out on a team lunch and he was not there. Everyone was talking about it and instead of diffusing the situation she shared an experiencing of her own of coming to work with a hangover. The determination was that open discussion will no longer be discussed in the workplace regarding people's wellness. The employee and the manager talked and she documented the discussion and stated it was positive. in hindsight, we should have an EAP offer to him? He wasn't saying he had an alcohol problem. He has since resigned - he had a performance issue in mid-July via write up and most were due to attendance - he was addressed verbally before hand. He conducted his exit interview with HR today and his story is quite different than what the manager communicated. He states he does not not like how the grievance was handled and that he felt there was a stigma of him being an alcoholic and that the manager never replied to it. That's not true, she met with him. He voluntary resigned - is there anything else that needs to be done? He's saying he resigned due to things (performance being not his fault). I am not sure I want to open up this can of works again by calling him to discuss the exit interview.	
4	If an employee was terminated, can we withhold her final paycheck until she returns her scrubs? Are we permitted to deduct for the cost of the scrubs if she does not return them?	
5	We have an employee that voluntarily resigned but he was in a commission based position along with salary and he is due to leave Sept 1st. When he leaves we will not be able to calculate the commissions that he has earned. Are we required to pay the commission? If we do when do we have to pay it?	
0	We terminated an employee for unauthorized use of company company property. He had PTO days left and wants to be paid for them. In our handbook it states that if you don't give two weeks notice you forfeit your accrued PTO. Do we have the right to not pay him PTO time if he was terminated for cause?

4	It has to do with a situation with an employee who put in her notice and she indicated she felt discriminated against. We want to let her go today but would like to discuss. An employee went into inpatient rehab 6 weeks ago and had performance issues from the beginning. I think we have been really careful with this. Last week we told her we wanted to do a PIP with goals - she was leaving on vacation and set the date for Monday to go over the PIP. We gave her a 30 day goal and made some internal changes so she would be working with a different manager(she stated she had problems with the other manager). She put in her two weeks notice today and indicated that we were discriminating against her and made false accusations of character and threats to be let go. We would like to let her go today, rather than work out the two weeks.

5	I work in England. We have a location in North Carolina. Last year we appointed an Operations Manager there. We asked him to do training and he was supposed to bring in new business. He hasn't done that. We have a maverick director in London who wants to get rid of him. I've read through XpertHR stuff. We have a proper contract in place for this position. Terminations will be a mutual agreement, and provide 8 weeks notice. It goes on to describe term by employer for cause for not meeting material performance objectives. It also states the employer may term only for cause, dishonesty, gross misconduct. We based his bonus on specific performance objectives for the first 6 months. And we were told he met those objectives. When the new guy came in - we told him we were going to pay him a noncontractual bonus of $14,000, but we didn't. New maverick doesn't want to pay it. I think we should honor our verbal commitment. I would like some guidance regarding the termination process should we have a meeting to give him a heads up, what about a letter, final wages, etc?

And her job starts on Wed 8/2/17. She offered to work here at Circle from 4pm - 8pm if we needed her. I was off on Friday and Monday so the information caught me off guard, i asked if i could give her a call later to discuss. I called her at 5pm that same day to ask her to come in for an exit interview and to turn in her keys. She then stated she thought she would just work 4pm-8pm. My question is will she be considered a resigned/quit status or is it considered a termination since i didn't accommodate her to work the 4-8 (a shift that doesn't exist) that she offered.

5	We have an employee an employee who was in an install lead position which means he had one other individual working under him. We had two separate employees complain of his leadership, demining language, and overall attitude towards them. He was verbally warned several times and we saw no change. As many as 4 employees saw this behavior and no change so he was suspended for a week without pay. He was told he would be in the shop until his supervisor saw a change on his attitude. The day he came back he worked a half day and walked out. We want to avoid any backlash. We are thinking we would pay his suspension to try and help avoid an risk of him coming back after us. If we pay, or don't pay, will it help our risk?

3	71 year old estimator and is on the US benefits for 3+ years now. There was an understanding this gentleman would retire at the end of the calendar year and apparently there was some internal quiet discussion with a mid-level manager who offered to let him leave now (last day was 8/8). Now the Seattle office is asking corporate if the employer will pay him through the end of the year...or offer to pay Cobra etc. My initial thought is that since hes medicare eligible he can enroll with Medicare but are there any HR or legal requirements to pay this guy anything at all? I dont believe there was anything in writing about his impending retirement but there could have been some emails back and forth. We arent sure why this mid level manager agreed to let him go now (this was agreed upon by the employee with what appears to be no misgivings) but corporate thinks that possibly this employee wasnt very happy at his job.

4	Good afternoon, I have provided my Employer Group the details outlining their coverage and the provisions stated in their Medical Contract. Theyve asked if its possible for ME to get a letter from Employee who has been awarded disability income that states she is not returning to her position. Also, this is the response I received from them when I asked If someone would be filling the vacant position: her position will be completely dissolved and her duties spread out among the staff. Once the other Office Manager retires or quits, that one will be dissolved as well. Yes, we have a Employee Handbook. Attached. Todd Monis Practice Administrator Thomas Podiatry & Associates 560 Riverside Drive A-101 Salisbury, MD 21801 So my (hopefully) last question is this: Is it MY responsibility to advise the Employee she needs to put something in writing stating she is resigning or will not be returning to work. I thought she verbally told them this when she forwarded the employer the SSI award notice (attached). Thank you!! Debra Debra E.

1	During an investigation of sexual misconduct we discovered additional information about violation of company policies.

3	I have an employee who resigned effective today, 8/9/17. They put in there notice last week. Our next pay date is scheduled for Friday, 8/11/17, but seeing that her last day is today I processed a manual check for all hours that would have been paid on 8/11/17 as well as all hours worked through today and all accrued/unused PTO. Is there any legal requirement that an employer has to cut two separate checks, one for PTO and one for hours worked? Or do we have to cut checks according to the pay period? The employee is arguing that the Company should have provided her two separate checks.	
5	Sanitation department employee has diabetes and at times passes out at work*; employer has accommodated his need for breaks for snacks, and removed him from any duties that involve sharp objects where he might get cut, etc. The employer states that ThinkHR has advised previously to have the employee obtain a medical certification of his ability to perform the duties of his job*. Employer sent the employee to their clinic for a medical examination based on his already modified job description. At the end of the exam he was told that he passed his medical exam and that the report would be sent to the employer. He demanded a copy of the documentation that he passed the medical exam and they told him he can get a copy from his employer as the employer ordered the exam. He became outraged, loud and threw a pen that hit a clinic employee. The clinic called the employer and stated that the employee is banned from the premises. Senior management would like to termination this employee; however, wants to know what the liability or risks are and what steps the employer may take in consideration of his disability.

1	Hi Bethany, One more follow up question for you related to our discussion regarding the dog incident as it relates to the RIF. Are we able to take experience into account for our business decision regarding the decision as to which 2 individuals we offer sales positions to? [cid:image001.png@01D2FFEB.B13B80F0] Above is the objective results from inception through June regarding the sales opportunities the 3 individuals created. As you can see, there is a huge gap between Kristin and Hailey. There is a smaller gap between Hailey and Casey (Casey is the individual weve been discussing), so the results back up our decision, however the gap isnt as big as wed like. The other thing that is factoring into the decision is actual sales experience. Kristen and Hailey both have sales experience, specifically selling to businesses like our customers. Casey does not have this experience. So in summary, our business decision is based on objective results, and relevant experience.... Are we taking on undue risk?

4	We have never terminated an employee by phone before. The supervisor wants to terminate an employee today for performance and have it done by phone. Our first concern is that she is out for a medical issue, but we just confirmed that she is not out on any medical issue. They were going to terminate her yesterday, but she was on an unpaid day as she is today. She went to another state to visit her family, she is too new to have accrued any PTO. What do we need to be aware of in handling this termination by phone?	
5	This is a follow up for an employee who informed us he is taking a leave of absence for a "personal" reason for an unidentified amount of time. Last Wednesday, I asked him to submit a written request with specific reason and dates with a deadline of 7 days. He did not send me a letter. I contacted him this morning via telephone and it doesn't sound like he has any plans to give me a written request with a reason for his leave or a return to work date. I would like to accept his lack of follow through as a voluntary separation. Do you have any sample letters I can send out as the employer?	
3	Is letting an employee go during probationary period consider a termination eligible for Unemployment?	
6	In the state of NY when a terminating employee is going to be paid minimum wage for his final paycheck, how are taxes and benefits handled?

5	I have an employee that had FMLA this year and then stopped coming into work 7/7./7 due to issues with his wife being sick. When we asked for medical documentation he decided to quit on August 2nd. He has not been paid since mid July and he used part of vacation time that he did not earn and he may have uniforms and tools that he may be owing us. He is coming in today. We are in Illinois can we deduct this from his final pay? https://thinkhrcomply.com/ReferenceHome/StateLaws/Illinois#/ReferenceHome/WagesandHours/WagePayment/IllinoisWagePayment

5	In the state of NY, we have a sales rep who is paid a draw. He is leaving at the end of this month. He are paid twice per month. His draw is $4000 bi weekly. We try to recoup that since he is prepaid a commission. Can I pull back all of it, thus giving him a zero check? Or do I have to pay him minimum wage? If I have to pay him minimum wage, we heard that minimum wage in Westchester County is different than NY. What is the minimum wage in Westchester County? Please call me at: 3145932664

3	I received an unemployment response form stating the information I presented was not sufficient to deny the employee unemployment benefits. The employee voluntarily resigned his position and said he was going to another company. What are my options?	
2	Can you please provide me with the CA termination paperwork?

5	Rose was also on the call. Employee is on MLOA. They came in yesterday and resigned, stating he was going to a competitor. The manager took his keys, and told him he was terminated. The employee had been using sick time, not SDI. We don't have a doctor note, but we have his statement that he was having neck surgery on 7/11 and would be out till 8/14. He requested to use all his accrued sick leave and we were paying it.	
3	A client just learned that an employee has died as a result of a suicide. The client is asking if they should direct deposit the employees last paycheck including any vacation pay due, etc. like they normally would. Please advise if there is any reason that they should or they shouldn't do so. Thank you.	
4	If an employee resigns and offers a two week written notice but then we decide as standard practice to release her immediately is she entitled to PILON (pay of lieu of notice)?	
5	We have a part time sales employee based in Idaho who works fairly infrequently. We've decided to separate employment becuase he hasn't been able to deliver sales and has really not been working for the last month or so (he has a fairly flexible schedule and works infrequently). He's paid on an hourly W-2 basis but the timesheets he has turned in reflect that he hasn't worked any hours for sometime. Are there specific things we need to do in terms of the state of Idaho regarding the termination?	
1	An employee has given notice and is leaving under good terms. Do we need to get a resignation statement in writing from the employee? Thanks.	
2	We have an employee that has been written up several times in the past year. We have heard she will be handing in a resignation letter with a termination date in November. If we receive the resignation letter we can terminate immediately instead of waiting correct? We have a policy in our handbook that states "Mosaic Clubs & Resorts reserves the right to have you leave work immediately upon receipt of your notice of resignation and is not obligated to compensate you for your notice period.". Please advise. Thank you.	
2	I am terminating an employee in New York for the first time. Can you tell me what I need to consider when cutting his final checks? Thank you, Teresa

5	An employee began medical leave on 7/24. He showed up on 8/10 and provided a 2-week notice. The manager turned around and terminated immediately. His check was not issued, how do we handle that and sick pay since he was on leave? Will he be eligible for unemployment? Is there liability since he was technically on leave? We did not receive a release back to work.	
6	The company is terminating an employee for gross misconduct and are having them arrested. Can they withhold final paycheck to recoup some of the cost?	
2	I have a question about severance payments. My boss read somewhere that the following items were not to be withheld from severance payments: state income withholding tax (if applicable), medical insurances (health, dental, and vision), 401k contributions and loans, and life insurance. Can you confirm this? Thank you!	
1	Via Voice Mail. Please call: 423-505-2115 We had an employee attend a rally over the weekend (Alt Right Rally). The employee was accosted by another employee due to their attendance and there was also a Facebook post alluding to the fact we employ Nazis. We are unsure how to handle this situation. Please call.	
2	Sent a termination letter via certified mail to employee home however it wasn't delivered. What do I do now?	
1	We have questions relating to exit interview process, and whom we can and should not share information with internally.	
1	We have an employee that admitted to stealing from us. They are in charge of ordering copper wire. In reconciling the invoices with inventory we discovered the theft, and the employee openly admitted this, stating they had a drug problem. Can we terminate, or are we forced to permit the employee to attend rehabilitation?	
1	We have an employee who we are considering terminating due to poor work quality - employee has not been brought through the usual steps of verbal, written, suspension, termination. He is in three protected classes due to his age, ethnicity, and disability. The immediate problem is that the errors made are extremely costly to the company and have to be reworked.	
2	Looking for best practice and guidance on termination.	
5	Can we terminate an employee who is knowingly associated with hate groups and regularly uses racist rhetoric on social media? One of our employees attended the "Unite the Right" Rally in Charlottesville over the weekend. Upon returning to work, he was accosted by another employee who began calling him a "F@#$ing Nazi" and accusing him of murdering people. Then , the employee posted to social media that our business knowingly employees a nazi and that everyone should boycott our business. You may contact me directly at (423) 505-2115. My name is Jason Gill. 25 min	
1	We had an employee that terminated, and we inadvertently overpaid by one full day. We still owe this employee a 30 day payout per our agreement. Can we reduce the 30 day payout to recoup the overpayment?	
6	In California, when an employee voluntarily terminates, I know we have 72 hours to deliver a final paycheck. I know that mailing a paper check within 72 hours meets the requirement, is it the same for initiating a direct deposit within 72 hours, even if the actual funds won't hit their account until a few days later?	
3	An employer verbally resigned to the President/CEO this morning. He didn't provide a letter of resignation; how should we go about requesting that?	
2	Do you have information about job abandonment and terminating an employee for no call no shows?	
4	HR Risk: Sister NP organization with 4 employees and the ED of operations and fund raising. ED has been having performance issues; not completing grants therefore delayed and loss of funding. Last week she missed a deadline again re funding. Employee was on a short leave for surgery which employer accommodated; upon return to work the employee was fully released to work. She has had follow up chemotherapy with the release to work. The employer would like to consider termination. Considerations?	
5	We have someone who filled out a contract who said he would repay relocation if he didn't work for us for at least 12 months. He is not showing up for work. You will agree to work for at least 12 months, voluntary termination prior to this time, full reimbursement is due to the company. Can we withhold the money we have already paid for him? He is not showing up to work, starting last week. He is stating that if he gets fired he won't have to repay it.	
6	We have an employee who showed up to work on Friday, and then advised at the end of that day that they resigned. We know we have 72 hours to provide the final paycheck. Is that 72 work hours? If we issue the check today and send it via overnight courier are still in compliance?	
0	Our company is headquartered in Denver, CO, however we have a remote sales force based throughout the country. Recently we terminated an employee that is based in San Diego, CA. If we have a company policy in place that states we do not pay out any unused PTO when an employee leaves the company for any reason is that policy valid in California?	
1	Two employees: one in California and one in Arizona. This is the first time we have ever terminated employees. We used to offer vacation - and they have some accruals - is it paid out? JustWorks is our PEO. If Arizona does not offer mini-COBRA, does benefits simply end? These are both at-will states - how much do we need reveal - what language should we use? Our founder is terminating these employees because their current skills are not relevant to the direction of the company but he wishes to call it a termination for cause. What is the difference procedurally for firing versus layoff - any tax implications? Sample termination letter?	
1	What methods can we use to deliver the pre-adverse action notice?	
4	I have a new hire office, manger position, started 2 and a half weeks ago. Around 2 weeks ago she emailed me that her dad has passed away. She keeps promising she is coming back to work. Has not been back to work. Searched online for dad obituary and could not find. Situation seems fishy. Want to terminate. Would like to discuss. She was here almost a full week and the following Tuesday she emailed that her father had a stroke. I responded and I did not hear back for two days, she emailed that her dad had passed. I told her we allowed 3 days bereavement for family members and I told her I was flexible for vacation. I emailed her for an update for Friday and told her we would like to attend the visitation/funeral. She emailed the funeral was that morning and would be in the next day. Now she has set times she would be in and kept pushing it out. It has been a couple weeks. I have checked for obituaries and the address of her parents and it sounds like he is still alive according to the church bulletin. Can I let her go for cause? Today was no show/no call. I think I emailed her last on Friday. Her emails are all at 5am. There are a lot of red flags.	
4	We have a part time employee who works in an offsite location. She sent an email requesting a pay increase. We responded that we would have to look at the review process first. She walked out on Thursday and did not return or respond to our calls until this morning, which was beyond the three day no call no show. There was a follow up conversation with the employee this morning and she advised the place up the street is paying more, so she was going to apply there. Are we still able to continue with the voluntary resignation?	
6	I think an employee is trying to use up their vacation time and then quit. If they take more than they accrue can the employer deduct the amount from their final paycheck?	
4	We have an employee who has been here a little over a year. She constantly has garnishments. She is on her 4th garnishment and we got a call that another one is being served. Is there a way we can legally dismiss her because of this?	
2	Can you please send information about job abandonment?	
1	I have an employee, located at our Florida office, that I believe has substance abuse issues along with financial issues that are affecting their level of work productivity. This person also has a high level of absenteeism and has used up all his sick and vacation pay, and now has been forced to take sick days without pay. The manager is more than likely going to terminate him. What should we be doing from an HR standpoint to be documenting things he has done, etc? Do we have grounds to terminate for this behavior? If we do terminate him, are we forced to pay unemployment to him or are there situations where we wouldn't have to? What would be the best way to handle this situation. I am not familiar with FL unemployment and what this employee is entitled to. Please provide step-by-step termination directions and what you would advise on how to handle this situation. Thank you!	
4	One of our employees has gone on disability for trouble with her knee. Her surgery is scheduled for October, but we never received any medical certification. We had a layoff on Friday so we had to let her go because we needed someone in the area. She is asking if she can get disability and unemployment at the same time.	
1	As a follow up to my previous email.... The employee that submitted a resignation letter effective in November but we are accepting the resignation now instead of later holds a position that has a base compensation plus earns commissions on banquets. This person has booked banquets in the next few months. Do we have to pay the full commission for these banquets? Can we prorate since they will not be involved in the banquet, what are we required to do?	
4	We have a new employee who had pre-requested some days off. After those two days, she contacted us to say that she'd been in a car accident. We have not heard from her. We've contacted her and her emergency contacts, with no response. What do we do?	
5	We had an employee that quit and I mailed him his last check in July with a return signature card etc., Just today I received the envelop back with a non-deliverable tag. I do not have a valid phone number for this former employee. What other lengths do I need to go to get him his check?	
4	A client had had a cleaning/housekeeper on the payroll for a while. He told her he doesn't need her anymore. Her last day is tomorrow. She texted me and asked me for a letter stating that her position has been "eliminated". Strange way to put it but you said I would have some HR resources. Can you help me with this? My question is: Is there any negative to providing this letter? Why would the employee be asking for this? What is our appropriate response?	
2	Dan called in with a request for sample termination letter when letting go an employee, for cause. He requested this response to be sent only to Dylan.	
4	(spoke to Amy) We terminated an employee under at-will. We chose not to discuss the various PIPs she had been on. She emailed us asking for her job back. How should I respond? We have no intention of rehiring her.	
5	An employee was terminated for cause last Monday and he was not given his final check and he picked up a payday check Wednesday. He was told he could pick u his final check over the weekend and it was not ready. We mailed out terminated employee's checks (it was not mailed out). He is upset and he has already filed a UI claim. It is now the 6th. We have it, its ready. He texted our chef and said he will not pick it up and he does not trust us and he is filing a TWC claim. Today is the 6th day and he is demanding hand delivery. Can we mail the final check? I will email him and take the chef out of the mix.	
6	An employee was involved in a Workers Compensation accident. After 7 days of the accident, the Medical Review Officer (MRO) disclosed the employee was under the influence of cocaine. The employee was notified he could not come back to work as the company policy does not allow drugs or alcohol at any given time. Do we have flexibility issuing the employee's final wages? How many days do we have to process final wages? Since it took the MRO 7 days from the accident to determine the employee was under the influence.	
0	Can you tell me what states other than California require earned/accrued PTO be paid out within a year when the employee terminates?	
6	When someone leaves and gives us notice when are we required to have their final paycheck?	
5	We terminated someone and gave him a severance letter, he signed and had it notarized but gave him 7 days to revoke it. In an email he stated that he would not revoke it, should we wait the 7 days or can we use his email as validation? Also can we do direct deposit or should it be a manual check?	
1	We're a MA based company with a few EE's in an office in Charlotte, NC. 1 of those EE's resigned. What needs to be provided to them and when?	
5	We have a service manager who is leaving. He put in his two weeks. He over-purchased without authorization. He has been a service technician in the past he is probably going to be working for a client. In the meantime we have been getting calls for him, and he is receiving calls direct to his cell phone about service jobs for customers, to be handled under the table. How can I approach this employee about this? We do not have a non-compete agreement.	
5	We just terminated an employee last Thursday, who is a salaried employee. He only worked for about 28 hours last week and we paid him for that 28 hours he worked accordingly. As he was working half day on Wednesday and Thursday. Do we have to pay him full-day for Wednesday and Thursday that he worked for half-day? The owner told me we do not have to pay overtime if its over overtime - they are hourly employees in the office. They are not the transportation employees.	
2	Can you send me a termination checklist for voluntary and involuntary terminations?	
1	We have an employee who we need to terminate in South Carolina - He is very highly paid - there are performance issues but he may not have been advised of these. Can we still move forward with termination? There is a contract that requires we provide 8 weeks advanced notice. If the person was to come back on us, what amount could they get?	
6	What is the best practice around delivery of a final check for a terminated employee and the processing of a resignation?	
3	If an employee is in jail and has no way to call us to let us know about his whereabouts, can we terminate due to our no-call/no-show policy?	
2	Can you please indicate where I can find a copy of the DOL to provide to an employee we are terminating? We are located in Georgia. Thanks	
1	We are laying off 5 employees from our mid-size company. 4 of them are over 40. What are the requirements for EEOC and the list that we have to provide for age, etc.? Does the list include employees that were not selected for the layoff?	
1	We are terminating an employee in Oregon. Are there any notices, flyers, brochures, etc. that are required for distribution?	
1	We have an employee that we want to terminate for performance issues. We would like to offer him severance. Do we have to have an agreement in place in exchange for payment?	
2	I am planning on selling my business and I am looking for a confidentiality agreement that is more expansive than the samples that you offer. Do you have any other sample documents? I would like something that references HIPAA.	
4	We have a client who was planning to lay off an employee and eliminate the position to combine those duties with another position. The eliminated position happens to be the person over HR. It was later discovered that she failed to verify an employee's eligibility to work in the United States and later falsified documents relating to the matter. Our client feels she her actions of falsifying paperwork were to protect the company not necessarily hide her own mistake. Our client is now trying to determine if they should terminate her due to the hiring issue or continue with the lay off as previously planned. Our client feels that she is the type of person who would bring action for wrongful termination as her duties would be transferred to a male and she is a female. Any guidance would be most appreciated.	
4	an hourly non exempt employee that has not showed up to work or called to let us know she would be out,and today is the third day of no call no show. We have had multiple people try contacting her, hr included, but she is not responding. At what point is an employer able to treat as job abandonment? Thank you.	
0	We have a GA based employer that is letting go an employee from Texas and we are wondering if the state law says that you must pay out employees for unused vacation time. In Georgia you do not have to but in Colorado you do.	
1	We are in Texas and we pay 1-15 on the 15th and 16-end of the month on the last day of the month. We have an employee we resigned with the last day on the company holiday. Do we have to pay for the holiday? How would be compensate her for the days she did work?	
3	My boss said that employers in California can no longer state that an employee is not rehirable anymore during an employment verification. Is that true? Has there been a change to a law?

4	Nora also joined us. Employee was let go last Friday. She phoned asking for a copy of her personnel file. This employee was fired for cause. I have my notes for that, but have not put those in her file. We recently had a domestic incident - two employees were fatally shot. This employee made racial remarks to others about the incident. We chose to fire her. My notes have witness statements and therefore, I'm reluctant to make these part of her personnel file. We decided that no amount of counseling would help her.	
5	We had an employee who was supposed to report onsite on Wednesday of last week. He never called/texted/or showed up, etc. One of our requirements is that he has to work onsite at least week, otherwise we cant keep him on. Prior to that, since his recent hire, we allowed him to work from home, and he would contact us and we would assign work. We gave him a month to figure out transportation down to the office. The month was up and we expected him at the office last Wednesday. He was told in person and in writing about this expectation. At what point can we terminate?	
3	Is it the law when you terminate somebody and they are a temp employee, does the temp agency have to follow a different rule?

2	Hi - Is there any off boarding material avaliable?	
3	When an employee is let go, must in be in writing? Reason for termination is a lay off - not filling the position going forward.	
0	I have 2 questions: 1. Commuter benefits. Terminated employees who have money left in their account. Is the company obligated to reach out to the participant regarding their balance. Do they forfeit that money? What is the employer obligation when participant do not close out their account, and funds are still coming out? 2. Termination. An employee living/working in the state of California terminated on 4/14/2017. We didn't pay until on Tuesday, 4/11/2017, are we obligated to do anything since she was not paid on her termination date of 4/14/2017? Also, our PTO policy stated that employees must meet 6 months of employment to be eligible for PTO payout. This person did not meet this criteria but lives in CA and we don't know if the state law supersede our policy. Are we obligated to payout her PTO hours since she lives in CA? Thank you.	
0	We have a policy stating that vacation time is earned as you work throughout the year. If an exempt employee resigns and has taken more vacation time than "earned", can we deduct the value of the overage from the last pay?	
0	Hello, We have an employee who's probationary period was extended from our usual 1 year, to an additional 6 months due to performance issues. She is now going to be let go, for lack of improvement. While our policy states that an employee cannot use vacation time off, during that period, it does show as accrued each month with the pay period. My question is; due to that accrual, are we required to pay our her balance upon termination?	
1	We are letting an employee go and we would like information about severance agreements and any paperwork we need to complete.	
1	Regarding our telephone conversation from last week, we spoke with our CEO and the company has decided to terminate the employment of the VP of Manufacturing. We do not have enough information to pursue a sexual harassment claim, but we do have enough evidence from various sources to validate his inappropriate workplace behavior. Our legal counsel is creating a separation notice and we will be letting him go today. We will be offering a generous severance package. Can we discuss?	
1	We are Burger King Franchises. Under COBRA we fall under one ownership. We have two store in a particular are, both are a total of 100 employees. We are closing one of them- 22 employees in that branch. Are we subject to WARN?	
1	We are terminating an employee and we need to know if we should provide to the employee a separation letter.	
4	Following up on the last call, the employee came in with doctor's note, but didn't wait to speak with me. She left abruptly. I was prepared to terminate her. She called me later, and I let her know I wanted to talk to her. Can I terminate her over the phone? Last night she sent an email stating she was not going to be in today.	
1	I have an employee that I need to terminate. I need to find out what I need to do to process the termination. We opened this salon a month ago. Employee has poor attendance, excuses all over the board, and she leaves before her shift is over.	
5	An employee abandoned his job. He stopped showing up and didn't call in and when his manager called him, he hung up on him. We issued his final check and sent it out with signature required but it was returned to us. What should we do with the check?	
3	My client is shutting down some satellite locations in different sates that have been operation for some years they are streamlining there operations back to the main location in medley Florida. They are closing a location in Chicago, Houston, new jersey, Virginia, los Angeles and san Francisco the question my clinet has is Hi Todd, I have a question, and I believe I am correct, but just to know if you have heard of this from anyone. Does DFW have to pay vacation? For example we are giving all the employees that were laid off 1 week of vacation, and the only state that is telling me that they are entitled to 2 weeks is Illinois. The way they are looking at it is accrued vacation. These are all hourly employees. I do understand salaried employees may be entitled to it, and maybe we will do something additional only because they have been with DFW since 2003. But as per what I have heard and understand, the company does not HAVE TO and Illinois is an at will state?	
4	Asking on behalf of client, Majors Plastic. Questioning a termination scenario. Early in March 2017, employee fell, no medical attention sought. ON March 13th, employee requested 2 week LOA to care for dying mother. Employee was on a 90 day no miss probationary period. Supervisor told her if she left, she would be terminated to which employee acknowledged. Her mother passed away, she called the company on April 10th asking if she still had a job. Our question is does she have any FMLA protection (she is eligible) for caring for her mother? She didn't specifically request it but it would obviously be implied. She has also since seen a Dr for the previously mentioned illness and has work restrictions. Company wants to keep termination in effect.	
3	Does a Company have the right to garnish an employees last paycheck if company equipment is not returned in working order? The employer wants the employees financially responsible for any damaged property.	
4	We have an employee that has taken a leave of absence, which was unforeseen. Due to the nature of the leave she was unable to contact us until yesterday. She did resign verbally, as her treatment will likely encompass upwards of 90 days. We have some questions. Can we accept the verbal resignation? When do wages have to be paid, the employee stated she is ok with payment occurring on the next regular pay date. Also, she has asked if monies for final wages can be made via direct deposit. Do the laws allow this?	
1	A customer is terminating service with us. How should I handle the layoff with all the employees? Should I give them advance notice? We have 73 employees total and we laying off 30 employees. CA employees.	
1	I need some clarification regarding the WARN Act when I am considering closing a single restaurant due to sales. We have 12 locations, so over 75 employees, but the singe location only employees 40 people	
5	We want to terminate our security manager position. He has not been meeting his quotas.	
1	We have an employee who has retired last week. We are paying him a severance of his health insurance through the end of the year. We are also asking him to keep him available for any consulting questions and we are paying him 40 hours per week through 12/31. What would be the easiest way to do this?	
5	An employee of ours was terminated after working for us for 35 days. He was terminated for rolling a truck when he was reaching for his soda. After the accident insurance would no longer cover him, therefore he could not perform the duties of the job. He has filed for unemployment and they want to grant it to him. How is he eligible for unemployment from us after only 35 days and he is unable to be covered on insurance therefore cannot perform the job he was hired for. How is he still eligible? Thank you!!	
2	Looking for a sample letter to give current interns stating that their summer internship is over . We also would like extend some of them to come back for winter break. Whats the best language?	
1	An employee drives a company vehicle as a perk (salesman) but we are self-funded and we decide who we cover and who we won't. This is the 3rd accident and affected 6 other vehicles. The manager would like to terminate based on this accident. Is this injury retaliation? There are attorneys involved. We are part of a group to self-fund insurance plans and there will be a recommendation from the group based on these plans and he may be kicked off of insurance. I think he admits the accident was his fault and there is a record of his negligence.	
2	I would like to discuss your response further. Do you have a sample letter to rescind employment?	
4	A Georgia employee was a temp for a while and came on board in December. She is 5 months pregnant and has had attendance issues since day one - she has been spoken to and has had two final warnings in her file. Our policy states occurrences that continue will be subject to termination. Additionally, if there is a continuous trend or pattern, we will terminate, even after 90 days. All the absences are oversleeping and they have nothing to do with pregnancy. This morning she stated she did not hear her alarm and overslept (she was almost two hours later today).	
4	I had dismissed a contractor employee and would like to talk to someone. She was working well for the first 3 days then was a no show for 4 days. She returned to work and appeared inebriated and stated her husband was on crack. Employer let her go then checked in with her 6 weeks later and asked for her job back employer agreed. Gung ho on the first day the next she was quiet then the following day showed up and kept on going to the bathroom which seemed odd. The following day she was nervous and ate a whole box of tick tacs. Her behavior was odd and she disappeared reappeared and disappeared. Telling both she was going on break at different times within 20 minutes of each other. Writing changed. Came in and 10 minutes later wanted to go on break employer asked her to stay. We wound up terminating the employee however she is now stating she is going to file a wage claim with the labor commissioner because we paid her $33 per hour not the $40 she requested. Considerations?	
4	An employee was released from a workers' comp leave on Friday, Aug. 4th to full duty. She called out Aug. 7 & 8th. She claimed to having continued pain due to her injury and requested a second opinion from her workers' comp case worker. She failed to call out the 9th, 10th and 11th and is out today. We would like to terminate since she has violated our 3-day no call/no show policy. What are your thoughts?	
1	We had an employee give two weeks notice, however we will be processing termination sooner. Are we obligated to pay them the resignation period? We do not have a policy or procedure that addresses this. The employee works remotely in Arizona.	
6	To Whom It May Concern, In addition to the request below, I would also like to know who to issue the employee's final paycheck to? The final paychecks issued to employees at the time of termination are always live checks, so in this particular case it would also be a live check, but need to know who should be the "Payable To". Thanks, Rita To Whom It May Concern, I recently had an EE unfortunately pass away in California. As we prepare his final paperwork, we've come across the fact that for his Life Insurance he's listed his Domestic Partner (DP), at 100%, but for his 401(k) benefit, he hasn't listed any Beneficiaries. So I need your assistance in understanding who would be eligible to receive his Life Insurance amount. Will it be his DP? If it is, will it be automatic? Or will his Estate receive his funds? For his 401(k) plan, who will be eligible to receive his funds? We don't know if the employee has any living siblings or parents, so we'd like to know how all his funds will be distributed. Please let me know if there's any questions. Thanks, Rita Sahakian Sr. HR Generalist [Sigma Designs] 47467 Fremont Blvd. Fremont, CA 94538 (510) 897-0130	
5	We have an employee who was involved in a very bad work related auto accident. He totaled his car and the car he hit. He was found at fault by the highway patrol and we are considering terminating him. He lives 4 hours away. How should we best handle the termination? Can we send him a certified letter or call him?	
5	We have an employee who has worked for us for over 20 years. He is now in his 60s and just sustained a work-related injury. He fell and hurt his knee. Overall, he is slower so his performance has suffered. We are concerned about his having another injury on the job. What are the risks if we separate? What if we ask him to retire? What if we ask him to retire and offer him some severance?	
2	My CEO says what you sent is not what we want. Do you have a letter to rescind an offer?	
1	We received notices of charges to our unemployment reserve account. What could the impact be to us?	
5	We terminated someone and gave him a severance letter, he signed and had it notarized but gave him 7 days to revoke it. In an email he stated that he would not revoke it, should we wait the 7 days or can we use his email as validation? Also can we do direct deposit or should it be a manual check?	
3	Is it okay that we terminated an employee who was out on disability? Can the employee collect both unemployment and disability from CA at the same time?	
3	A terminated employee stated that they recorded conversations with their supervisor without the supervisor's consent. I would like to report this terminated employee to the authorities if this is a crime. Is it a crime?	
2	Can you tell me how many days AZ employers have to pay employees they terminate? I check online and it says 72 hours but I have an HR law book - Personnel Problems in Your State (BLR) update 6/2017 and it says 7 days, which is what I thought. Can you confirm?	
6	An employee came in and resigned today giving no notice. Our payroll had already processed which included wages for her last days worked. The direct deposit will take place on Friday, within 72 hours of her resignation. Can we allow the direct deposit to go through?	
1	I spoke with Claudia earlier today. Have a follow up question. We are going to terminate our sales manager but re hiring a sales person what are our obligations there? We are postponing this until tomorrow at 9 AM so please have Claudia call today.	
1	We have an employee who we are terminating tomorrow for poor performance and because he is not a good fit for our organization. I want to review best practices for such a termination and to know what are the required notices for terminations in California. Also what are the final pay laws.	
3	If an EE is is injured while on the job-site and is placed on modified duty & said modifications are met, yet the EE refuses to work, can we terminate the EE?	
3	Hello, Our EE Handbook states the following: Introductory Period The first 90 days of continuous employment at Superior Roofing is considered an introductory period. During this time you will learn your responsibilities, get acquainted with fellow team members, and familiarize yourself with the Company in general. Your supervisor will closely monitor your performance. Completion of the introductory period does not entitle you to remain employed by Superior Roofing for any definite period of time, but rather allows both you and the Company to evaluate whether or not you are right for the position. The Company may extend a team members introductory period beyond the first 90 days at its discretion. Upon completion, employees may use their available Paid Sick Time. With that being said, are we able to let and EE go whom is in the 90 day period if he or she can not perform their job duties. IE: Is afraid of heights but their job duty requires them to get on a roof (roofer).	
5	We had an employee at one of our sites and unbeknownst to us he had a warrant out for his arrest for 5 months. FBI came in and picked him up today. Would like to discuss how to handle this situation. The special agent worked for a bail bondsman - the employee had a warrant and didn't pay and didn't go to car. The special arrangement said he was being put into jail. What legally do WE need to do - do we have to keep his job? He said he was a special agent (bond enforcement). If he doesn't comeback, do we have to pay him/cut his check now? Do we have until payday? Are we required to hold his job? When is final pay due if we process job abandonment?	
0	We are located in the state of Texas and currently offer PTO on an accrual basis. Are we required to pay out accrued but unused PTO at termination? Currently our policy states that payout is at the manager's discretion; is that problematic?	
4	An employee returned from a leave of absence and her attendance was poor. Her manager addressed this with her. The employee did not state any health issues that may be causing her absences. She hasn't been back in 3 days. We have a job abandonment policy we'd like to apply. Would this be a voluntary termination? We have 1-2 days to pay out but she also owes us unpaid premiums from when she was out. Can we deduct from her final pay?	
1	We issued a written warning to an employee on July 24th for poor performance. Since then it has not improved and maybe is even worse. What are our next safest steps? Can we terminate?	
2	I received an audit letter from EDD. Just want to review it with someone.	
2	Can you please send termination paperwork for the state of OR?	
3	What steps do an employer take to terminate an at-will employee in California? Employee has worked with us for a year but has not shown for a week of employment and I want to make sure I'm following the correct steps and procedures in terminating an employee. In addition to cutting this employee's last pay check, what other steps/procedures should I be following to meet state and federal guidelines? Please send any documentation or forms that would need to be completed. We are a private non-profit school with no teacher contracts.	
5	We need to fire an employee. He has shown ongoing performance issues and a poor attitude. Additionally, he's been caught on several occassions smoking marijuana at a customer's home. I saw him personally doing it once and told him he couldn't do that during work hours. Recently one of our lead installers found him doing it again. We don't have a formal drug and alcohol policy and I know that he uses marijuana to help with his glaucoma but I expressly told him he could not do this and he did it again anyway. The performance issues have to do with him not pulling his weight on job sites and he has been spoken to about that as well. One other wrinkle is that I gave him a loan and we agreed in writing that he would pay me back with deductions of $70 per paycheck. Can I deduct the remaining amount from his final check?	
3	We have a policy in our handbook that employees have to turn in their company equipment before they can pick up their last check. We have an employee telling us that that is not legal.	
6	For California law, it states that an employee who leaves the company without giving 72 hours notice must receive their final paycheck within 72 hours of their last day. Do the 72 hours include weekends? Or would that only be business days? For example, an employee quits on Friday afternoon without giving notice. Do we need to provide the final check my that Monday? Thanks!	
4	Executive Assistant applied for a position at two of our other locations. She was not awarded the position and now her supervisor wants to terminate her for performance. The supervisor believes that since the employee applied for another position, she does not want to continue to work for the supervisor. The supervisor does not have any written documentation on performance issues. The only negative that I have found out is the employee gave some "push back" when told she would have to support two people verses just one.	
6	In New York State, when terminating an employee for performance reasons, when is their final paycheck due?	
6	I know Washington State requires a final pay check to be paid on the next regular pay date. What if the employee quits with no notice, is there any extra time to get the pay to them as there is in other states?	
1	We have an employee who just turned in their resignation notice, offering two weeks. We will not allow the employee to work out their resignation period. Do we have to pay the employee beyond the last day of work?	
3	We had to terminate two employees this morning. In the JW system on the termination page there is voluntary and involuntary. They were terminated for misconduct. How does JW follow up with terminated employees? Will involuntary termination preclude them from receiving unemployment?	
0	When an hourly employee is terminated and I'm paying out the accrued PTO balance on their final paycheck, our payroll system generates more PTO once the payroll has processed. Since the employee was terminated during the payroll period, are they entitled to the additional PTO accrued for that same payroll period? I'm inclined to think not, but would like some guidance.	
4	We terminated an employee on 8/10/17 and asked that she return her office keys (which she did), her laptop and her mobile phone all of which was company property. She said she had the laptop and phone at home and would return it the following day. She still has not returned this equipment. We contacted her by telephone today requesting again that she return the equipment to us. She told us that she was still very upset over the termination of her employment and she would "try" to return the equipment tomorrow or the next day. Question: I am told by our Payroll Dept. that we cannot hold her paycheck back because of DOL rulings. My question is can we deduct the cost of the equipment from her paycheck if she does not return the equipment by August 18, 2017.	
1	We have a severance payment that we will be processing. This is for an ex-employee can we do this through direct deposit? Is it issued like a 1099 statement or just issued like payroll?	
4	We have an employee that is on medical leave on FMLA and she returned back to work and there had been an issue prior to her leaving on medical leave. She was looking out company property to send out resumes. We were supposed to sit down and write her up for that. When she came back from med leave we sat down and went over it with her. She did not return to work the next and was to return on the 14th and I did not hear from her and no doc's note. I followed up with an email and no reply. We have a no-call, no-show policy of three days. Can we terminate her?	
3	We have received a call from a customer stating they saw a post from one of our employees regarding the protest over the weekend, and that if we (the company) are willing to employ someone like that, they will no longer frequent their establishment anymore. How can the employer handle this?	
1	A tenured employee just submitted his resignation with an effective last day of 8/30. If we do not wish for him to work until then but are willing to pay him until then, can we legally do that?	
2	It's regarding a termination. I need to know if I need to provide a reason in writing.	
1	I would like to run the scenario we discussed yesterday by you again with my partner on the line. We're considering going a different route with the termination from what you and I spoke about. We are considering termination due to elimination of that position. We are hiring for a different position that is at a different, higher level and has a different skill set. We would not have considered him due to his poor performance and inability to improve. Our concern is that we never put him through an PIP and we have used that in that past with others.	
5	I have a 10 month employee whose pay is distributed evenly over 12 months. He signed a contract to return to school to teach in September. Our fiscal year starts on July 1 so he has received 2 "unearned" paychecks. He recently moved off campus and abandoned his position. His contract states "if an employee resigns during the term of this contract, he/she agrees to pay any amounts paid in advance of work completed." If we do not receive payment voluntarily from this employee, is it legal for the payroll company to reverse the direct deposit? Thank you!	
3	Via VM: I have a question regarding an employee that has incorrectly recorded time on a time sheet. Now that we have become aware of it wanted to find out what we need to do. They under noted how much time they worked.	
1	Question: EE gave notice for 8/29th. Do we have to keep him?	
1	We have an employee whose workplace injury claim has been denied by Workers Compensation, who is currently off of work on restrictions we can't accommodate and hasn't returned FMLA paperwork. The employee is non-exempt/hourly. What protections does she have? Can we terminate?	
0	If an employee quits when they were in the negative for PTO, does the company have the right to withhold pay to pay themselves back for the excess PTO previously paid out?	
3	Payroll- Pay Period Change Please distribute to Suzanna Carey. Thank you. Regards, Matthew T. Miller Director of Human Resources [Argent Management LLC SM] 2392 Morse Avenue Irvine, CA 92614 (T) 949.777.4061 (F) 949.777.4261 MTMiller@ArgentManagementLLC.com Sent: Friday, April 20, 2012 3:01 PM Subject: Payroll- Pay Period Change To All Employees: We will be implementing some changes to our payroll process, which includes changes with our payroll provider, ADP. This strategic decision will enable us to expand services available to you such as providing you with access to a suite of tools, resources, and value added services to enhance your employment experience. You can expect to receive more information on the expanded services in the weeks to come. The first step in this transition process will be changing the payroll period end date for each pay cycle. You will continue to be paid on the 15th and last day of the month. However, each pay period will now end 5 business days prior to the actual pay date. To eliminate any confusion, the following information should clarify most of the questions that you may have regarding this change. Why is Argent Management changing the pay period end dates? In order for ADP Payroll to effectively process your semi-monthly payroll, they will require a minimum of 5 business days to collect, verify, and process your paychecks. Will the company provide any financial assistance to help minimize my financial impact? Argent Management would like to minimize any adverse impact that this change may have on our employees. In that regard, we are offering a payroll advance of 5 days. Will I have to pay back the payroll advance? Yes, the 5 day payroll advance will need to be paid back should you leave the Company and your hours worked and paid will be adjusted accordingly. How will my salary be calculated? * Your annual salary will not be affected * It is only the pay period end date that will change When will this change take effect? The next few pay periods will be dated as follows: Pay Date: April 30, 2012 Pay Period: April 16, 2012 - April 23, 2012 (5 day payroll advance added) Pay Date: May 15, 2012 Pay Period: April 24, 2012 - May 8, 2012 Pay Date: May 31, 2012 Pay Period: May 9, 2012 - May 23, 2012 * Beginning April 16th and going forward, employees will be paid for actual hours worked including any overtime on the pay date associated with that pay period. It will be necessary for all employees to input their hours into the time and attendance program (SAGE) by the end of each pay period. Stay tuned...Over the next several weeks we will be providing you with more information regarding our upcoming ADP employee self-serve website! In the meantime, if you have any questions about the change to the payroll end dates, please let me know.	
3	My question is regarding unemployment. I have a client in KS with a KS resident that gave notice and he voluntary terminated his employment. The employer received from the DOL an unemployment notice. It's our understanding that if this employee left on his own accord, he is not eligible for unemployment, but maybe we are wrong?	
1	We terminated a sales employee and there are still expense reimbursements that need to be processed. What is the timeline for those reimbursements?	
6	We had an employee that stopped showing up, so after 3 + days we reach out to them and also their emergency contact to find out what happened. There was no answer, we left a message. We sent out his final check and it came back as undeliverable. I went to a seminar that had advised to keep the check for one year before issuing it to the state as unclaimed funds. On our checks, I believe it says must be cashed within 180 days. When would we void the check? Please advise.	
1	We are laying off one employee and have not had to do this in the past. Please advise.	
5	We have a production employee who is working modified workers comp. He was no call no show for 3 days but one of those days he called in 4 hours late and also dropped off a status report doctor notice from the WC clinic. He was and is still on modified duty. Management wants to terminate him for 3 days no call no show. I'm afraid that will prompt him to get a lawyer and sue for 132a claim and other legal action. Technically he did violate our attendance policy of 3 days unreported absences. What do you suggest?	
3	We have a client EES Energy. They had a CDL Driver who got a DUI, and they had to release him. He is attempting to collect UI. What can they do? When you call back I'd like to conference in the client so that we can discuss.	
5	Associate has been with us for two days and we've discovered that he was recently released from jail and was fired from his former employers.	
4	We are having a situation with supervisor and we would like to review terminations procedures. We have a manager (female, over age 40) who has been managing a small office with 3 Customer Service Reps, with one full time driver, and a few part time drivers. Her management style and behaviors are very harsh, and this has been driving away employees (we have had a lot of turnover) as well as business (some of our referral sources refuse to work with her). We have written her up about a year ago and we have even changed her reporting structure to resolve the issue. This worked for a period of time, she has reverted to her previous actions, and her current employees are indicating they no longer want to work for her. Her review in July was competent, however, we have spoken with her since then about these ongoing issues. We can no longer afford this type of turnover and disruption to the business. What is our risk if we proceed with terminating her?	
0	We are terminating an employee tomorrow. After termination paperwork, take out full month's deduction for health coverage. If doing so, would drop below minimum wage. Can we pull the cost of the health insurance from his vacation pay?	
3	Do we have to pay someone for the day they quit? Say they called in and quit before their shift. Or maybe they come in, clock in and then quit.	
2	Unregistered User Kathrine Hildbolt 914-318-7913 kathrine@slicelife.com Template for a severance agreement.	
1	We have an employee who has passed away due to an illness. The company wants to provide the family a certain amount of severance over the next few months. How would we go about doing this if we cannot run it through payroll?	
1	We have an employee who gave his two weeks' notice yesterday. We don't want him to continue, what are our options for the next two weeks?	
4	We have a salaried nonexempt employee, who in 2016, was allowed to borrow ahead on accrued vacation by 1.5 days, and was in the negative. Then she resigned after the beginning of the year. Are we allowed to deduct this amount from her final pay? Can we ask her to repay?	
1	We have a longer term employee we are wanting to terminate due to performance matters. This really stems from the employees inability to understand or follow instruction unless its spelled out in written form. This is an older female employee and previous performance reviews have touched on the matter, yet have indicated overall performance was satisfactory. We have a new manager that has taken over (approx. 4 weeks ago) that wants to part ways immediately due to the inefficient. Are there problems in termination?	
1	I am letting someone go today and want to make sure I don't have to give the reason? Internally the manager has mentioned the employee has been making mistakes and has not completed work. At-will?	
3	My client, the employer, terminated her medical technician yesterday. Reason: 2 patients called employer confidentially to tell her the tech skipped a medical test, saying, "You always pass so we'll skip it today. It'll be our little secret." Employer reviewed the medical records and saw that one patient was marked as passing the test. The other was not even recorded. Employee was terminated by employer over phone. She was told "I've discovered you have deliberately undermined my standard of care." Employee threatened with wrongful dismissal complaint. Wants letter stating reason for dismissal TODAY. What are employer's responsibilities here? Any recommendations?	
5	Brandi and John - We have a truck driver that was employed to do a specific job. Summer truck driver. In the wintertime it is explained that it is transitioned to a salt route and hours are supplemented with additional work. This individual has refused to do the winter part of the job. He still has the keys of the truck. Can we withhold his wages in order to get him to return the keys?	
3	New client in Florida and I just did first payroll. Employee worked 71 hours but was terminated a couple of days ago. The employee showed up today and wants his paycheck. They didn't put hours in the system so a check was not cut. The owner wants to wait until the employee brings back the uniform. The owner is out of town until Monday. I want to know if they have to pay this employee today?	
6	An employee has passed away. What are the rules regarding distribution of his final paycheck?	
5	Employee termination. Technician is suspected of theft; no video. He took a radio out of a car and put in his personal space. He stated	
6	Employee quit without notice on Wednesday - we paid final wages by direct deposit today. Final YE bonuses are scheduled to be paid on 2nd payroll of the new year which would be Jan 30 payroll. Are we required to pay his bonus as of today as well?	
1	Employees job is ending after March, due to lack of work. We have a different position open in marketing but he would not be qualified. We have a severance package we are planning to give him and would like some advice on when/how to notify him. When do we give him the document?	
1	Are we required to pay a minimum for lay offs	
0	Unregistered User - Ten Delta, Bhavik Katira 917-582-4574; bkatira@tendelta.com; CEO An employee was terminated end of December. I do not believe we paid out his accrued vacation. He was a salaried employee. How do I calculate his vacation pay? I thought that JW had paid him via manual check, but I cannot be sure. What are the rules for paying manual check or DD as final payment in CA?	
3	Our client has an employee who they are going to terminate. they want to make sure they follow proper protocol. The employees husband was fired months ago for physically fighting others in the manufacturing facility. Since then his wife who they will also be terminating has alleged targeting, a hostile work environment, and that management has done nothing to correct the issues. None of this is true of course and the employee has even stated that she's being poisoned, all kinds of things.... Can you advise proper protocol for firing an employee whom you expect will go to EEOC, etc.?	
3	What are the legal requirements for terminating an employee in the state of Connecticut? We are at-will. We prepared a separation agreement, with information a 401K and COBRA info. If they sign the waiver they get 8 weeks of pay and we pay for health care. They want a copy of their file and they are telling me by law that they need a reason for the termination. I called the CT DOL, and they said that we do not need to give a reason for termination. The CT provided us a link to the at will statement. We have never provided.	
3	If an employee terminates in the middle of a month, is paid biweekly, and does not want to elect COBRA or state continuation, who is responsible for the remaining amount of the employee's portion of the premium for the month?	
3	Follow up to yesterday's issue: Must we require the employee to pay us for uniforms that they do not return? We really do not want to pursue chasing after an employee who has not returned their uniform??	
4	Notified employee on Friday that she will be terminated. We have over 100 associates, but we only have 10 employees. She is our Admin Assistant. Our handbook clearly indicates at-will employment, she has poor performance, not able to do job. We gave her 4 weeks notice. Do we have to provide her anything else?	
3	Want to ensure we are compliant with termination. Plan to terminate employee due to lack of attendance. Handbook states: at will employer & "any failure to report to work for 3 consecutive days will be considered a voluntary termination" over the past 10 months, this employee has repeatedly not shown up to work for several days in a row, without contacting employer. Twice the employee submitted Dr's note for portion of days missed. Understandable. However, so many other days not accounted for. Employee has been talked to (and documented) previously regarding attendance, however, no write ups. Wanting to ensure we are compliant before termination occurs.	
2	Do you have a California specific severance agreement?	
2	2) Do you have sample exit interview questions? We do conduct surveys but I would like to understand best practices. (Issue 2 of 2)	
1	When we terminate an employee do we have to have more than one of us present? Are there certain forms we have to fill out/provide other than COBRA information?	
4	We have decided to lay off with a group of layoffs for an employee who is on FMLA. Do we need to allow her to finish out her FMLA before we terminate her? Or can we contact her now for the termination?	
4	Terminated employee stated that she did not want to come in to pick up her personal items and to have her sister bring her the items. Her sister does not want to be involved and will not take the items. The employer called the former employee and advised her that her sister declined to take the items on her behalf and that she would pay for the employer to ship them to her; however, the former employee has not responded. How should the employer handle?	
0	Can we allow employees to borrow against future vacation accruals and therefore go negative with their balance? Furthermore, if an employee quits with a negative balance, can we reduce their earnings bring the balance to zero?

4	We will be terminating an employee on Friday. She is an exempt employee. She called in sick earlier this month and we paid full salary including a full sick day which she had not earned yet. Can we deduct it from her final paycheck?	
1	Corp office is in GA, but we have employees in Chino CA. One employee have not heard from him since 1/12. We were sent some reports late last night, by another employee, that the missing employee was being sought by the police, and is being held by police. This morning the office manager received a text by someone, that said Juan's wife called and said he is unavailable. She indicated he will be unavailable for the rest of the week. We want to make sure we are able to move forward with job abandonment even if we had not taken that action in other cases. California law is weird and we want to avoid any issues.

1	We are a restaurant company, we have an employee who has been employed with us since September, as a line cook and a baker. Theyre going to split up the duties and eliminate the dual position.

4	We are trying to terminate an employee, hopefully without ending up having to pay unemployment. The employee was given a verbal in 03/2016 and a written in 04/2016 and a final in 05/2016, along with a demotion for poor job performance. She was counseled in 10/2016 for tardiness. And another final warning in 11/2016 for fraud. Her job performance has still not been up to par but she has not received anymore verbal or written warnings. We do have an employee handbook in place, which she signed, and she's not meeting the job performance or the quality work requirements in the handbook. Can we terminate her or do we need to do another warning?	
5	Is reasonable to terminate an employee by letter? One of our employee's called in early Monday morning and stated he would not be into work due to a personal emergency. He has been no show no call for two days and the supervisor has made multiple attempts to contact him without response. Our policy states that an employee must report in daily regarding any absence (with the exception of certified leaves) and if the employee violates this policy then the employer will consider them to have voluntarily resigned. Can we do this by letter?

4	We had a new employee scheduled to start with us on Monday. She did not show up for new employee orientation as scheduled and then emailed the assigned recruiter that she was unable to attend because she had given birth to her child. At no time during the interview process nor at the time the offer was extended did she disclose her pregnancy and the hiring manager indicated that she did not physically look pregnant. Are we required to provide her with 6 weeks of leave and hold the position open for her during that time or can we rescind the offer and allow her to apply in the future?

5	Q2 We have a nursery- delivery driver who has worked for use about eight years and we have found out the employee is doing side work for our customers. This has happened before and we spoke to him several months ago and gave him a warning. We just found out the employee did side work for a client. The work performed is something we do as an organization. However, based on the size of the job, we probably would not have taken the job. The bigger issue if that he continues to take these jobs and we are concerned he is representative our company. Can we term him for soliciting our customers while on the clock?

Supervisor asked for proof of leaving the country and he failed to bring in documentation. He brought in a prescription bottle for himself. He said he had to go to Mexico because his pregnant girlfriend was in the hospital due to a car accident. What are the risks if we terminate?	
5	We have an employee who is in his probationary period and he's had a series of issues, but most recently he came into the detention facility where we provide medical services on his day off in order to correct some paperwork he'd completed incorrectly and on his way into the facility he was asked to stop by one of the guards and participate in a pat down. He claims to have not heard the guard and he went directly into the medical office. The guard is claiming that he ignored her request and the Commander of the facility has pulled his security clearance, because he failed to comply with the request of one of his employees. Our employee will not be employable at this site without that clearance. Due to performance issues including failure to complete paperwork on time, and no call no show we have determined that we were going to terminate the employee. We are looking for how best to discuss this with him during the termination meeting. I am not sure if we should discuss the issue with the guard because I think that he did not hear the guard or if maybe he was just not listening closely enough to her, an she should have come closer to her him.

One of the notified employees would be qualified for a new position and I want to know if I could put her in the position even if the position is a project manager. She started as an advocate for the tribe, but didn't get a law degree. The tribe changed the position title to an attorney and gave it to her. We got a grant for a project manager position that would allow an experienced advocate, but it comes at a different rate of pay. Can I offer the project manager position to her at the new rate? She is in the group that wants to sue us, should I avoid offering her the position because of her involvement? Another employee is attorney that doesn't have much experience. Can I change his rate of pay?

4	We have an employee who has been with us since February of this year. She location in our California location. We had to write her up previously for attendance issues, and then again recently her supervisor had to speak with her again about attendance issues. She then went to speak with our HR Director to let HR know that her attendance issues are due to a health condition and she will need to work from home 2 days a week. We have not previous indication from the employee that she had a medical issue. We were planning on laying her off tomorrow. Are we okay to proceed with the reduction in workforce? She would be the only employee impacted by this reduction in workforce and it is as of yet unclear if we would be replacing her position in the near future.	
4	An employee gave two weeks notice that she is quitting, but due to the confidential information that she daily has access to and recent disciplinary problems with the employee, her supervisor ended her employment immediately. I'm fairly certain that this turns her quit into a termination, is that so? If so, will it mean she can collect unemployment insurance even though she actually quit? And does she have to be paid for the two week period? In our policies we do request employees to give a 2 week notice in order to receive their accumulated vacation days.

2	Hi There, For the California Change in Relationship Notice, I totally understand what information needs to be included and when it needs to be provided to an employee. My question is, is it REQUIRED that a company representative physically sign the document. I can't find anywhere that states this requirement. If company name is provided, as well as a typed in name of the company rep providing the form, is that sufficient? Even on the sample Change in Relationship form provided by EDD, there is no signature line... only "BY", which indicates to me that a company rep name can be typed in. Please let me know. Thanks, Monisa

5	We have an employee with a significant amount of banked personal time (more than 2,500 hours). He was planning to retire within the next year and draw the money out bi-weekly for more than a year (as if he were still receiving payroll). The TN Code Ann Section 50-2-103(g) seems to prohibit us paying him in full any later than 21 days following his discharge date. I know that teachers often retire with large amounts of banked time and wonder if there is some provision that allows it to be paid over time, even though this state code says there are no exceptions. Can you advise me if there are any options?

Any reason why we shouldn't? or liability on the company?	
4	Two days ago we spoke to an employee about some issues with her work, but it was the first time so it was an informal meeting. That afternoon she left early without saying a word, took all her personal belongs and have not heard from her since, no response to calls or text messages. It is obvious now that she has abandoned her job. She still has a company computer and keys to the office. So what steps do we take? Should we call her emergency contact and be sure she is ok? She is owed a final check, but I'm guess we can not deduct for the value of the computer and rekeying the door. Should we somehow communicate to her our understanding that she has abandoned the job and is now terminated?

When she was out on FMLA, she apparently left the company telling her manager, but the manager didnt tell HR and she was never terminated from the company. Since I found out yesterday, yesterday we terminated her benefits and offered COBRA. We allow our employees to use PTO and paid time off hours while on leave to cover their insurance deductions. They work it out with their manager to cover their insurance deductions.The last paycheck she received was 5/24 and the day she left on leave, but they believe that 6/5 was her voluntary termination date.

We asked her for a doctor's statement for the absence, and she also provided a list of medications that she is taking, some of which are opioids. We were then concerned with her driving, so we asked for a doctor's release which she was not able to provide. We do not have any other modified duty, so we laid her off and advised she could reapply when she was able to go off of the medications. We are finding out now that we should have offered her FMLA.

4	We have a stylist who has been with us for a period of a year. She is refusing to count down or reconcile the cash drawer at closing. This is an expectation of the job however she is flat out refusing, and doing these duties. What can we do?	
4	Can we terminate an employee after she's turned in a resignation? She was hired as an on-call employee to work at 2 locations, is refusing to work at 1 as she doesn't like the manager. We are concerned about the morale of other staff if we allow her to work at only one location but others still have to do both; her e-mailed resignation states she is "not willing to work for an agency where I don't feel supported". She picked up 5 shifts through the September that she said she'd still work, but we will fill them if we are legally able to terminate her employment now.	
5	An employee has been out on leave for almost a year due to a Workers Compensation claim. We would like to terminate his employment since he is not able to return to work. Can we do this?	
1	Hello! We currently have two employees who have been on disability since the beginning of the year and would like to terminate them. We are a small business (less than 50 employees). What are our options? Please advise.

4	An employee has called in sick the past two weeks. She had also done this immediately after hire. She has on worked here since July 6. Are we able to terminate her?	
4	EE resigned last week verbally to her manager. She was asked to put in a written resignation and she declined. She then told manager on 8/17 that 8/23 last day. She called out sick today and not sure if she is coming into work tomorrow. Can I accept a verbal resignation? If the employee doesn't show up for work tomorrow, what day should I may her official last day?	
6	We had an employee in one of our IL stores quit on 8/16. Normally, his last check would be delivered on 9/1, which is on our regular payroll cycle. He is stating that Illinois state law is a "check in hand" state, wherein we must deliver his final check before regular payroll. Is this true?	
3	We have 11 employees, does FMLA apply to my employees should they themselves that time off due to personal medical leave of absence or to care for another family member or relatives? If so, how long can they be absent from work until I can consider voluntary job abandonment or to legally terminate them, as I can't keep holding their position(s) for too long as it imposes unreasonable burden on the operations of the company.	
5	On Monday, I met with an employee who admitted to stealing $2,450.00 in cash on or about March 28, 2017. Later that night, one of our customers told one of our general managers that they gave this same employee $7,000.00 in cash the other day which the employee claims he put into his draw (he failed to follow policy) and, when we went to the draw with the employee Tuesday morning, the $7,000.00 was missing. In addition, while waiting for the police, we discovered that he failed to receipt (follow policy) on 2 other transactions. The total amount missing on three transactions he failed to follow policy was $7,950.00 plus the $2,450 he admitted to have stolen = $10,400.00. His paycheck is being delivered to me and he has called me to advise me he is coming to pick it up on payday. If an employee steals money do we need to turn over the check to the employee? Our business is in Florida and his check will be less than $2,000.00. Thank you Paul	
0	Our company policy defines PTO as being accrued each pay period for a max of 80 hours per year. However, we chose to give out 80 hours as a lump sum at the beginning of each calendar year. Would we owe those 80 hours to an employee who leaves mid-year?	
2	Hello: I'm looking for sample mutual non-disparagement language--the type that might be included in a separation agreement. Do you have any samples? Thanks.	
6	We called earlier about a final paycheck. We are doing the final paycheck and no matter when someone terminates, coverage does not end until the end of the month. We have always deducted the premium from the final paycheck. If it costs $600 a month in premium and the beginning of the month is $300, that's all we take? Is this in writing somewhere? The employee is in California?	
6	We had an employee that resigned, without giving 72 hours notice. When are final wages due? What are the required forms at time of termination?	
1	We are terminating an employee today. We are located in CA, but the employee works in NE. Do we provide the CA termination documents?	
2	Do you have a rubric or something similar when reviewing/creating a reduction in force policy? I am working on an employment (RIF) policy and wanting to ensure that I address all laws associated plus would like to be able to provide manager's a rubric to help them if it is decided to do a RIF. Thank yoLeslie	
4	Termination with ADA and FMLA: A former employee was terminated for attendance. The reason behind those attendance violations is a drinking problem. My understanding is this came to light after the fact, after the termination. We were not informed during the discipline process and the employee was not under care at the time. She has now sent a letter requesting FMLA. What is our exposure and how do we respond? She was terminated 3/3 and the letter is dated 3/10/17, a week later. When they said they were going to let her go, I asked if she was in treatment and she was not. At that time she did not request FMLA. This all came to light at ther termination. The final incident was no call no show for 3 days - job abandonment. I am trying to determine if we have a trail. All of a sudden this came to light and I asked if she was in treatment and the response was "no." I received this letter today - it was not addressed to me, it was sent certified mail and bounced around because the address was not good - it was sent to a regional manager.	
4	Employee is a part time bookkeeper, working 4.5 hours a day. She has only been with us 1.5 months. When I was out of town earlier this week, she didn't show up or call in on Monday. The controller tried to reach her, but no response. They then tried her emergency contact, her sister, who knew nothing and got off the phone quickly. They asked the police to check her apartment, building manager said she moved out. Tuesday, she called in spoke to receptionist, stating she had been really sick, couldn't come in yesterday or today. She called out on Wednesday. She called today, spoke to me, and said she has been violently ill and went to a doctor, and has a note from the doctor. I told her when she comes in on Monday we have to talk about why she didn't call in. I'm thinking we may want to separate and wanted to check my risk.	
4	I have an applicant who failed drug screen. She was notified verbally of the results. I am sending adverse action notice. She indicated the results for marijuana and she has a medical card for it. I don't believe the law allows you to be under the influence while on the job. I just want to confirm that all I have to do is send her the adverse action notice to rescind the offer.	
5	I rechecked the video and confirmed how much he stole. We called to meet him today and terminate his employment - should I show the video to him? I spoke with friends who say I call and tell him what I found and that we are terminating his services - one suggested I first ask him. He didn't tell us the register was short. He did not close the register out because he left early. Both days he stole money he left early. The video is conclusive. The stylists were too busy to be witnesses. What are the risks with termination? If you were me - I am really concerned about the theft, it clearly shows in the video. Are you saying a business owner has to be careful even if you have absolute proof? Should I put theft in the termination letter? What is the wording for the letter? When is final pay due?

1	An employee failed to fulfill his jobs for the day (we are a contractor for a cable company and we give them six or seven jobs a day) and we terminated him as a result. There were some other issues at play in terms of misconduct. This ex-employee is now refusing to turn in his equipment. He has $1,000 worth of tools or equipment that belongs to the company. What can we do?	
5	We rehired a long time worker and all was good for awhile. Now he seems unfocused, uninterested in the job, seems he's sabotaging his position. He blew up at my husband, the owner, and we fired him. He applied for unemployment but he was denied benefits. He has appealed. The truth is I don't mind him getting benefits but my husband is the one that responded to the letter. How should I handle the appeal meeting?

3	I have a 15 employee consulting firm that has questions regarding terminations. This is an "At-Will" employer. What documentation should they have prepared prior to termination to minimize wrongful termination suits? Does the fact that they are an "At Will" employer change how they should prepare for a terminiation? If they have a problem employee that they have repremanded several times, how should they document prior to termination? Conversely, if they simply have to lay someone off because of their budget, do they have to justify wtih documentation as an At-Will employer? Thanks in advance for your help!

4	An employee gave notice in Monday that she was resigning. We agreed that her last day worked would be April 28. I'm already beginning to see a change in her attendance and communication about whether her intention is to finish out the month is unclear. If I take her off the schedule would that be termination?

4	Employee with attendance issues was on final notice, the following Monday she called out saying she couldn't work for us any longer and was willing to give her two weeks notice if wanted it. We advised that we could split it and call 4/14 as her final date of employment. She agreed and took the week of to seek employment. Today, 4/14 she came in and said she can't quit until she finds other employment.	
4	Our executive director is getting the sense that the board may be letting her (nothing has been shared with me one way or another from the board) and she's asked my advise if I think it would be better for her if she just resigns.	
5	We had an employee give a verbal resignation. Today is supposed to be his last day and he has stated that he would like to stay on. Can we continue with the the separation of employment?	
5	Art calling on behalf of Noemi: An employee is on his 90 day probationary period. He injured his back at work on 4/7 and we have filed a WC claim. The employee was in so much pain this past week that he went to the ER. One of my managers called him up and terminated him. Can they do that?	
5	We have an employee that has continued to violate company policies. We have a few disciplines on file (a verbal and written), we have four in the last six months. We are going to part ways with him. We had to move him around to different stores due to the policy violations. The store we moved him into had additional supervision. The Manager told him he had been handpicked to work in her store and later told him that he wasnt complying with policies and procedures before entering that store. The policies/procedures are the same for each store. He is an African American Male and had been written up for: Tardiness, neatness, not following paperwork/documentation for customers, etc. We want to talk about risk factors.	
4	Hired an ee about 30 days ago and planning on letting her go today. She has very poor performance. Planning on doing it this afternoon. Today we received a unemployment notification on her. She works part time the UI office told us it was just notification to our company and that are account was not being hit and it was from her previous employer. If we let her go today will it appear retaliatory?	
4	An employee has had attendance issues and is on her final warning. Today, she came back after an unexcused 2 hour lunch and just sat down at her desk as if nothing was wrong. I spoke to our VP and he said that we should terminate her today. However, while she never stated that her attendance issues were due to a medical condition, she has stated in the past that she has a medical condition that requires her to take more frequent rest room breaks. She has been given the opportunity to disclose if she has a medical condition that causes her to have these attendance issues, and at no time did she disclose any issues. We have even asked her and she said no. How should we manage?	
5	We have an employee who was dealing with addiction months ago. We told him he needed to go to rehab if he wanted to keep his job. He did and provided documentation of entering an completing his program. We paid him full wages for 5-6 months while in rehab. He's returned to work and we're beginning to see the same types of problems again. He's begun acting weird - passed out outside, fallen asleep while eating lunch, can't seem to think or communicate straight and he's confirmed he's relapsed. The owner wants him terminated but I'm concerned that termination will violate ADA.	
6	We have a chef that is an exempt employee and also receives commission. We have his final pay check available, but he is demanding that we pay him also his commission on his last day. Are commission checks part of the final wages in California?	
2	I would like to read a termination letter and would like a second opinion.	
1	I have to lay off 3 employees tomorrow. We already let go 3 contractors. I want to confirm we are not covered by the WARN ACT. I told the managers not to talk to employees because most of the time they shoot from the hip and Im concerned they will say the wrong things. The company offers no severance but we are offering outplacement services. We are giving 3 days notice before the termination is effective.	
2	I am executive director here at the foundation and I am being impacted by a workforce reduction. As the only full time employee and ED, I'm also the person who would handle gathering all the required information regarding a termination of this nature. Yozell has provided information regarding COBRA, but I'm also in need of information regarding severance agreements and severance pay.

3	I have someone who wanted to work for us for a month. Will she be able to collect unemployment from me if she is only working for a month?	
4	I have an employee that started with us on 7/19/17 and should have worked 25 days, but only worked 14 days, missing 11 days since employed. She went home on Monday because of a migraine, never called or showed up on Tuesday. I reached out to her and left her a message stating I was checking on her to make sure she is ok and that I need her to give me a call so we can discuss this situation. Never heard from her, then today Wednesday @ 8:29 her sister called in stating she has a doctors appointment and a doctors note, I informed her sister that I left her a message and have not heard from her and if she can please have her call me. At this point we want to let her go because she has missed so much work and under her 90 day introductory period. Can I let her go at this point? And if we can do I need to have a conversation or can I prepare her final paper work and if she calls in have the conversation over the phone or do I need to have her come in?	
2	Do I give her the 7/7 date or the date of the termination letter on 8/4? He never showed back up to work after July 7th. His wife came by to ask for the 401k distribution. Do we use the date of 7/7 or 8/4 for the date of termination? Also should we send him the COBRA paperwork? If so as of what effective date?	
6	I have an employee that we will be terminating. She owes us money and wondering if we can take out the money automatically from her final check. Also, when does the check need to be issued?	
6	The final check for her specifically. If we are releasing this manager on Wednesday and we regularly run payroll on Wednesday for the prior two that will be paid on Friday can we provide the employee their previous two weeks pay on Friday and their 8 hours of pay for Wednesday within 6 hours.

5	Hello-I have 2 questions: Question 2 of 2. An employee provided us with doc note stating office work only/sedentary, no climbing, no driving, etc.on 6/.8/2017 in TX.We did an accommodation letter. He is a technician 1/driver for a environment services company. He then told all his co-workers that he had seizures/epilepsy. He then started to not show up to work or disappear for days at a time stating he had to go get his medicine. He would text his supervisor same day stating he would not be in. He is to be re-evaluated on 9/1. He is clearly abusing policy. We also do not have any office work for him. We would like to term him based on conduct/lack of work	
1	Our employee handbook defines job abandonment as 3 consecutive shifts of no call no show resulting in a voluntary termination. The supervisor attempts to reach the employee and a letter is sent to last known address. Then we start the termination process. We have a remote call center employee in NC who was no call/no show for 3 days, we processed a voluntary termination, submitted IT ticket to cut off access. If IT doesn't cut access a terminated employee, they can still log in. This call center employee got into system, and started taking calls today. Are we required to pay him for today, even though we terminated him already?	
6	Can you advise on the final wage payment rules in Colorado? What are penalties?	
6	Our organization just experienced the death of one of our program members. They were shot and killed while on the clock. Our question surrounds the employee's pay.

4	QUESTION FROM WOMEN'S PAVILION OF SOUTH MS, PLLC: We have a new employee that has worked less than 90 days. She stated yesterday that she is pregnant and will have it confirmed with a doctor on 9/8/2017. Since this employee is still serving her 90 day probationary period, can we legally terminate her?

1	Hello, we have a part-time employee who we will be discharging for continued absenteeism and tardiness. This employee has copyrighted educational materials in their possession that we need back (signed agreement). This employee has a scheduled shift tomorrow. Can we tell the employee to come in, get the materials from them, and then discharge without paying for the scheduled shift? Or would we then have to pay for the scheduled shift unless we terminated them today (and risk them not bringing the materials back)?	
1	Hello - We have an employee that has 5 weeks vacation on the books. We are going to be terminating this person from our employ.

4	Employee receiving harassment text the last 24 hours at home from a potential employee. Filing a report with the police and uncomfortable to return to work. she is a new hire on a 90 probationary period, in which her review was to be scheduled in a few days for poor performance and far to many absences on her probationary period. Interviews and investigation have started regarding the complaint. Can we ask the employee to work while going through the investigation and accommodate her working environment to feel safe? If she refuses to come to work what recourse do we have? The texts are valid but it puts us in a situation in which we want to keep it separate (the review and the texts). The texts messages are dead ends. I am continuing to investigate. I don't know if its an employee or outside the company. Someone was asking if she would go out with them and that another employee said she might be interested. But the person never says the name. She called out sick again prior to the texts. Today she came in, we did a police report and I sent her home and that we'd make arrangements to make her feels safe, walk her and out, etc. Last night she mentioned she had to have the police have her come in, and I suggested she go to the police. It is personal phone and not being here at work when the texts were received. She has an asthma issue.	
2	Involuntary termination in CT. If we have an employment contract, are we still an Employment-At-Will employer? Can you clarify this for me?	
0	Is separation pay taxable or untaxable? In NC, is accrued vacation paid out? What happens to benefit continuation, we want to cover him through the 8-week notice? Is it okay to send the termination letter via email?	
1	We have an employee who was on a write up and we are letting him go. I am looking for a release of liability waiver.	
5	An employee resigned providing 2 weeks of notice however, we noticed in his last week that he wasn't doing much so we want to let him go. Will this still be considered a resignation?	
1	We have a policy in our handbook that states if our cash drawer is short an excessive amount, this could lead to termination. The employee who is in charge of our cash drawer was short $70. I have been told it was due to a system error. Do you think I can terminate for this shortage?	
6	Question re: employees that quit and give 72 hours or less and the payment for the final check. What are the final pay rules in California? Can you confirm the correct wording to articulate the 72 hours/ notice requirement? Is there any reason there wouldn't be this time frame? Are there similar rules in other states? When an employee gives notice, is their word binding verbally or via email or in writing? Should we come up with a form for them to complete?	
4	Employee in Texas is in a sales person has needed intermittent time off due to a health condition. Employer has accommodated this employee informally over a number of years without an ADA certification (she is not eligible for FMLA due to the location requirements) however she is not meeting sales objectives which then affect the company's revenues. Every time she is absent she brings in a doctor's note. Employer would like to terminate this employee. Considerations?	
2	An employee resigned by phone with a supervisory but he's unsure if the employee was giving notice or if it was immediate. Do you have a sample template that I can send the employee requesting clarification?	
3	A client has an employee that resigned immediately with no notice. The employer had paid out accruals the employee did not have and she hasn't worked long enough to earn it back. The employer would like to know if he has to pay her the wages for the last week. If figures he can recover the negative accruals by not paying her hours from the last week.	
3	We have issues with our employees leaving without giving us notice and they did not return their cash key. Can we hold their final paycheck until they are to return the key? If not, can we make a policy as the employee deposit $50 at the time or hiring and to refund the $50 when they give back the key.	
4	I have an employee that initially submitted her resignation two weeks ago and today is her last and she asked yesterday if she could stay on. She has previously put in a request for an accommodation to take care of her son. She is not eligible for FMLA.	
1	We have an employee who we are letting go and we will be offering him a severance package. He is over the age of 40 and I'd like to review the consideration and revocation periods.	
4	We have a tip tool of cash and credit card tip which our employees split at the end of the evening. After a period of time we have been finding that money was missing from that pool calculation. I discovered when viewing our video surveillance system that one of our long term employee's had been taking cash from the tip pool. She would take it from the pool, put it directly into her purse, or take it from the pool hide it in the back room then put it into her purse. I suspended her pending an investigation and conducted a review of our records and further found that there had been no shortages of the tip pool on evenings when she did not work. Do we have enough documentation to proceed with termination? Employees are aware they are being monitored and taped. Video cameras are in plain site and monitoring stations and in full view of the breakroom.	
3	I have two retail stores and I am closing one of them. I have two employees that will be affected. It will be a layoff situation. They both know that the store is closing and I want to give them a letter. Is there anything that I should be considering?	
5	Regarding an employee that was absent due to being incarcerated. Employee is in CA - he did not call in or show up for 3 consecutive days. He called and stated he was incarcerated and that is why he did not call. We asked for redacted proof of incarceration. He said he would have this and would show up the next day. Now, he is saying he cannot obtain documentation. We called him and left messages and he finally picked up and said he couldn't get the paperwork.	
4	I have an employee that has been out of work for almost 3 months due to a non-work related injury. The employee has stated that the injury was caused while she was giving birth prior to being employed by us. The company has had her on approved LWOP during the past few months. She just provided the company with a doctor's note that states that she remains under work restricts for another 30 days that will keep her from performing her work duties. Can the company terminate her at this point. We need to fill her position.	
3	Employee submits 2-week resignation letter. With one week remaining before the separation date, employee is injured in a workplace accident. The employee suffers a fairly serious knee injury that will require surgery(s) to repair. The accident is clearly a workman's comp claim. We are now past the resignation date. The question is, should we proceed with the termination since the workman's comp claim will proceed regardless of employment status? Are there any risks associated with the termination since the employee submitted the resignation in writing?	
5	One of our officers has been with us for 3 years now. He has received a verbal warning in the past (March). It was for taking equipment home. He signed a counseling and everything. There was another incident at a site location. We would like to terminate based on him abandoning his post. We have GPS records on that. He denied it. He is also a volunteer at the site he works at. He requested FMLA for baby bonding while we put him on leave for the investigation.	
3	The HR person at one of my clients is being encouraged by the president of the company to "retire" one of the sales people. The individual is 58 years old, has a quota and is leading all other sales people. This person has not been given any type of a negative evaluation, nor have they been put on any type of performance improvement plan. The HR person is concerned about terminating this employee, as there is no other reduction in force nor is the position being eliminated. She is looking for a list of reasons why "retiring" this sales person could create issues for the company (e.g. Wrongful termination, age discrimination, etc.). Anything you can provide would be greatly appreciated.	
3	we have an employee that did not show up to work on Monday, Tuesday or today Wednesday. She did call on Wednesday to the office but talked to a coworker and mention that her step-son was at the hospital for food poison. our handbook states; Personal absences without justification and prior notification (with one day in advance or as soon as it is reasonably possible) to your immediate supervisor will be subject to disciplinary action, even and including being terminated. If the employee is absent without notification and without showing up at work for three consecutive days, it will be considered abandonment of work and La Abuela Mexican Foods, Inc. will process the separation from work as a voluntary resignation on behalf of the worker. If the employee without the supervisors authorization and emergency situation, abandons his job during an assigned schedule, he or she will be subject to termination from the work relationship in an immediate manner.

5	I have an employee that started for us as a salaried employee and then we decided he should be hourly. During the time he was on salary he used personal time and went in the hole - (-32) he is now given his notice and is quitting the company. Can we deduct pay for this from him?	
4	We have an employee who has severe attendance issues. She called in today again said that she overslept and that she would be in late. She still has not shown up to work. Can we term her over the phone or do we have to do it in person?	
4	We have an associate that has put notices and we have decided that we dont want to accept her two weeks , can we not accept it and not pay her ?	
1	Employee provided notice and we let her go yesterday with full pay. Is this okay?

4	A customer called to inform us that her tip was changed after she signed the ticket. We reviewed several months of tickets from this stylist and found 50% of the tickets had changed tips. Do we need to get the employees statement before terminating her?	
2	I did not receive the email from Friday. Please resend.	
5	We had an employee issue on Friday. The employee was accused by several other employees of threatening them, others. The supervisor spoke with the other employees to verify and we decided to call the police, after speaking with you on Friday. They immediately dispatched two officers to the site, and advised us not to do anything before they get there. Management then decided to also terminate him when the police arrived. During the termination, we explained that there had been multiple allegations made of employees hearing you say threatening things (referencing getting a gun and coming back to take care of your enemies, and the same in Mexico, and also concerning a bomb.) The employee denied saying those things, just saying no. The meeting went okay, there was no resistance on his part. He doesnt feel like he should be terminated in this way. Later on he said I think I know who told you. One of the officers heard him say that and told him that if you are not happy you can talk with your attorney, but dont even think about any type of revenge. The officer explained he is not to come back to the job site and that if he does the company can immediately call the police and he will be immediately arrested. The officers also advised to review our company safety plan/policy, to question people without security/safety badges, and to protect and follow our safety plan. A couple of employees are nervous right now. We want to discuss safety plans in general.

4	We have an employee who has been a no-call, no-show for 2 days. This is not the first time this has happened. She has been a no-call, no-show in the past and her excuses have been her cell phone was not working or she overslept. She has been warned that any additional instances would be grounds for further disciplinary action of termination.	
1	We have an employee who is salaried and is on her 10th day of employment (start of the 3rd work week). We have come to realize that this employee is lacking many of the social skills and intangibles required of her position and would like to proceed with terminating this employee. We are uncertain of the requirements in place to properly complete termination, as this employee is 5 months pregnant. Although our reasons for termination are completely unrelated to her pregnancy, we are aware of the potential implications. We do have documented (via email) proof of our concerns with her work that we have emailed to her and CC'd other members of management. What is the most professional and appropriate way to handle this situation? We assume that termination sooner, rather than later, is the best option.	
2	I'm looking for a sample notification that identifies employees who will be terminated due to a reduction in force informing them of the job titles and ages of the other employees in their group. Do you have something like this?	
2	I have an employee who gave his 2 week notice with our company, what documents do I need to provide to him besides a change in relationship form?	
1	We have an employee that has had several health issues and has excessive absences. In addition to that recently, a roommate committed suicides and he has been mentally unable to come to work. His performance has been severely affected and we have been wanting to terminate him before Christmas. We are now at a point that we would like to move forward with termination. Are there any issues that we need to be aware of?	
5	Good Morning - We recently terminated our Fleet Manager. He has taken some items with him including his Rolodex with vendor contacts and account numbers, value=priceless. He states that it was his Rolodex . Now the maintenance staff has to start from scratch in figuring out who are vendors are. He has also taken some tools and consumable items, value under $1000. In email communications he admits having these items but says he will not return them. Do we have any recourse in trying to get these items back?	
3	if a church is exempt from paying unemployment taxes, should they include a statement in the employee handbook that they are not required to pay/offer unemployment should an employee leave? Our Response: Employment under the church does not necessarily warrant compensation under unemployment benefits upon separation, may be more applicable, though no such statement is required. An individual's benefits are related to other employment, duration of employment, separation reason, and earnings. Being employed and separated from employment with a church does not necessarily deny benefits under the unemployment program.

5	My question is we have EE who quit on the 5th. He wants his 80 hours of vacation pay for 2017. He was paid his vacation pay for 2016 already. He said he called the state and they told him that he should get paid for this. I just want to make sure before I pay it out because this doesn't make sense since he only worked 3 days for the year 2017.	
3	A client is in Mississippi and they currently run a background check on all new employees. They just bought a new company and after the purchase, they ran background checks and found that one of the employees has a murder conviction from 1979. They would like to terminate him; is there anything that would prohibit them from doing this?	
1	January 1st was a paid holiday for our company. Employee gave notice of termination on January 2nd and we decided to end his employment after working that day. Are we required to pay the 8 hours of holiday?	
5	I'm going to ask on advice on drafting a letter. Exhausting a FMLA leave: The dates the EE was out were May 20th - Sept 16. He came back w restrictions from Sept 19th -nov 18th. Then he went out again starting Nov 19th to now. He has been collecting unemployment since Nov. The doctor said he could come back but lifting no more than 5 lbs. We need him to lift at least 40lbs for his job descriptions. He has been off work because we had no more work for him due to those severe restrictions. I want to terminate him because he can no longer fulfill his job descriptions and we have tried accommodate him hoping he would get better. I would like help and advice drafting a letter on what I should say. I know the doctor will say the same restrictions on Monday, they're just playing this game. He was bitten by a dog on his arm in May. He is a 77 y/o man. We have to fill his job.	
0	When an employee applies for unemployment, must they use up vacation time first to qualify? In Nebraska.	
4	We have an employee who was out last week for three days. During this period we determined her position was to be eliminated. Because she was on sick leave and is now able to return, does this impact our ability to terminate?	
6	Am I required to mail the final check to the employee? Can I tell the employee I need her address to mail the check but then tell her we can not to get her address for the police report?	
2	Thank you for the prompt advice! I just wanted to know, what would happen if we kept it on file until he essentially asked for it?	
3	Layoffs: Employer has a position that they want to eliminate. Incumbent is not performing well and has not been put on a performance improvement plan. However the senior management has decided that they do not need this position and don't plan on replacing it so they want to eliminate the position. Considerations?

2	Executive Severance Agreement?	
1	I need guidance on a staff reduction that would not follow our process of last in, first out. We are in dire straits mode, so much so that our owners have taken a 75% cut in pay. My approach is to minimize staff in each sector of our business while maintaining a skeleton crew that is much more versatile in KSA's to give us better leverage for the current business needs. With this approach it would affect a majority of a protected group (over 40) but not all. We have reduced staff in the last year by 50%. Please advise. Belinda Harlicker 832-319-0534 mobile #	
1	Following up on the situation with the layoff of person out on maternity leave. We have come up with an agreement on severance and have a release form she has completed. What are the other items I need to give her?	
4	Hello, I have a question regarding the appropriate termination date to record for an employee in our system. One of our current employees was involved in a serious car accident last month. She was in the ICU and just this week regained consciousness and was well enough to be discharged from the hospital. It was confirmed today that she will be relocating to another city to live with family members who can help her with recovery. My question is, do I record her termination date in our system as the last day she worked, or as today's date when it was confirmed that she would not be returning to work at our company?	
1	We have a client that is asking: When terminating an employee what is required? How do we administer COBRA?	
5	We have an employee who we were considering laying off this year. In the interim he went out on a medical leave of absence with an emotional issue. He was out for 4 weeks, and just returned. He is still going to therapy. We now have a client reporting that he has not done any work for them in a year. We were not aware of this, and need to terminate his employment as this is egregious. If we do this, will he still be able to get unemployment benefits? We do not what to block him from getting unemployment. Do you know of any outplacement services in the Boston area?	
2	Confidential.	
4	I have an employee that started last Friday and she called yesterday and said she is resigning her position. I don't have her set up in any systems (except time keeping). We us third party ADP for payroll. How long do I have to pay her? Do I need to set her up in ADP as an employee? Or can I set her up as a contractor? She said her last day was yesterday.	
3	When our handbook was reviewed we were told we can't have category for "insubordination" because it could infringe on employees rights. If an employee is told to clock out and she does not, can that be considered a fire-able offense?	
3	Company not subject to unemployment benefits My company is not subject to giving unemployment benefits. Should I still give a termination letter for layoffs? Also if I havent given one, should I attempt to retroactively do so (ie. Employee laid off in March)?

It has been two weeks and we have not seen any improvement and furthermore, his performance has significantly diminished. Recently there was a meeting and the situation escalated and we don't feel comfortable with his continued employment. Can we sever the relationship and offer him severance? Our Performance Improvement plan does not stipulate that we reserve the right to further discipline or terminate prior to the 4 weeks.

The same day he turned this in he also turned in his resignation with his last day being 9/1. So he will not return. He will utilize his sick time until his last day of 9/1. He has already cleaned out his office and I have been told he has turned in his keys. My Executive Director does not want to accept his resignation and wants to go ahead and terminate his employment effective immediately. He does not understand why we would allow him to continue to take his sick time if he does not plan on returning to work. Can we end his employment effective immediately? Even with a medical leave of absence?	
1	This is a follow-up to your response. The reason we want to terminate the offer we extended is we ended up restructuring and now no longer have a need for that position. Does that make a difference?

Received another call today, Monday, August 28th from his girlfriend that Quintin will not be released from jail until after his court date on Tuesday, August 29th, 1:00 pm. His normal working hours are Monday Friday from 8 am 5 pm.

He will miss three days of work, normally considered voluntary quit. Any advice on how to handle this incident. His Supervisor asked if we could terminate his employment.	
3	The question is, we have an employee that is terminating their time with the firm. They may need to work part time. The employee is in CA (Santa Rosa) How would I handle this? Do I just switch them from full-time to part-time until they decide? How are the benefits handled?

6	We have an employee in CA. His last day is the 29th. We are processing payroll that hits the 31st. Can final pay be direct deposit in the 31st if employee agrees. Do I have to send him a live check? The employee gave us notice - I think I misread the law and thought as long as he was paid within 72 hours of his final day it would be compliant.	
3	We have two employee who were change from contractor to full time employees. Their behavior has changed dramatically to the point where we are considering terminating both employees. Each work remotely. They have banded together and refuse to provide me with weekly recaps and I am unable to determine how productive they are. It does not appear they are being productive and taking care of the clients.

She has admitted to this and she is in a position where she collect payment from patients. Based on information provided the employer application requires a disclosure of criminal convictions. The employee stated she did not have any criminal convictions & the application. Included on the application is an attestation statement which she violated. If the employer is moving forward with a separation we recommend a focusing on falsification of application. Keep in mind that the city of Austin has a Fair Chance Ordinance, which prohibits employers with 15 or more employees from asking about criminal convictions prior to an offer is extended.

4	Hello! I have an employee that is out on a Workers Comp Claim since July 2015. I still have her on leave and am covering her benefits. I need to term her benefits, to be compliant with our plan, so I think it would be best to also term her at this time. She has also filed a claim against our workers comp insurance, so that makes it more tricky. At this point is it ok to end her employment? I don't think her job is protected anymore.	
5	i have an employee who's medical claim was denied by L&I. He went to another doctor and got a activity prescription with light duty under the same L&I number. L&I will not pay for anything.

5	We will be laying off (terminating) an employee. We have been reducing our workforce for some months now. My concern is this employee has been with the company for 10 yrs, he's over 60yrs and we do not have any negative documentation on him. The one that will remain employed and move into his position is younger but he is far more efficient. Do you think this could lead to a claim?	
5	We have an employee who has been out on workers compensation. He has been cleared to return to work for light duty only. We don't have any positions that have light duty. Are we permitted to terminate him?	
2	Can loan forgiveness be used as settlement compensation in a separation agreement ?	
3	Good Morning, We had an employee discuss their salary with another employee. Is this grounds for dismissal? It is not addressed in our employee handbook.	
3	I have an employee who is out on FMLA due to having a baby and is to return Tuesday, September 5, 2017. The employee called today to state that she will not be returning. The employee has not paid for this months benefit premiums. Will she be responsible for the full premium for the month (including the employer contribution) Our policy states a two week notice must be given to be eligible for rehire, would this apply if the employee is out on FMLA leave too?	
3	We have an anonymous reporting tool; current and past employees can lodge a complaint. There is one locations with 4 different complaints in the last month. There is tension between an aunt and niece. There is one that states that the aunt is stealing from the company and that she is having an inappropriate relationship. We do the investigations for these complaints. Management feels that the niece is the one who has put in all 4 complaints and they want to terminate the niece. They work in same department. They would give her some type of payment and let her know that it is not working out. We have done this before and we worked with legal counsel. What are your thoughts?	
5	Employee asked for a week off and we granted it. We tried to call the employee, no response. He filed for EDD and now we received an employment verification for him. What date do I use as a termination since he never came back from leave?	
3	When a company has a new employee and he/she is not working out, is there still a number of hours that they have to have worked in order to be eligible for unemployment in Virginia?	
5	I have a client whose employee had went to a personal doctor and had work restrictions that the employer could not meet. The claim was turned into work comp who later denied the claim determining it was not work related. Essentially the employee lied about the incident and turned in a fraudulent work comp claim. As the employee is not effectively disabled due to his work restrictions he was saying he would go to his personal doctor and have him remove all restrictions so he can work again. This is not an employee the company wants to hire back. What options does the company have to terminate him or not bring him back if he does get the work restrictions changed?	
4	Our HR department received an email from a current employee indicating that she was submitting her official resignation due to her personal and professional goals no longer aligning with our organization. We accepted her resignation as presented and moved forward to fill her position. (we are a private school and with school starting soon, we needed to act quickly) Shortly after the resignation email, she sent a email to our Principal indicating that she was taking a leave of absence due to medical issues and stress. We have responded to the employee indicating that we have accepted her resignation as submitted and that the position is no longer available. she is still indicating that she is taking a leave of absence, however we stand firm on our decision that the position is no longer available for consideration. We would like to confirm that we are on the right track and have a defensible stance. Sincerely, Alana Aanestad VAP Admin	
5	We have a gentleman here that put in his two week notice making his last day September 1, 2017. Our plan is that if he works any day in the month, he gets coverage for that month through the company. My current situation is: This gentleman is being very snotty, cocky, smart assy and we would like to let him go sooner. Would we have to honor his letter and assume he would have worked on 9-1? Or, if the work load is such that the supervisor wants to give everyone Friday off, would we still have to honor his letter? BUT... if I am thinking correctly, I believe if he decides on his own not to work on 9-1 I can cancel his insurance as of 8-31... right?	
1	We have an employee who we want to terminate, but who keeps calling out. Can we terminate his employment over the phone and mail his check to him?	
4	We are a restaurant business in MA. I hired a manager and her agreement was to work for $60,000 per year. She worked for three days, then no call no showed. She has not shown back up to work. She just emailed and after two weeks said shes interested in getting her pay.	
1	We have an office in San Francisco we are closing. We had two employees ask about applying for unemployment. They were all given 18 month notice and offer in our Denver office. We had five people who turned down the offer. Now there are two are three who are struggling to find jobs.	
1	Layoff of employees Most of our work force is in Nevada and Alaska, both at will employment states. We are looking at a layoff as we will have several projects ending in approximately a month. How can you do a performance based layoff, keeping your high performers and laying off the lower performers? Some of the lower performers may be employees who have been with the company for longer periods of time. Can an easy ranking method, such as "good results-good behavior", be used?

2	Is there termination paperwork that I need to provide to employees who are separating from the company?	
3	We are getting calls from franchisees who have been affected by the hurricane and if there are any resources on how disaster unemployment assistance will affect the employer experience rating.	
4	A stylist's license is not showing up as active - what are the repercussions of letting her go? I don't want to pay unemployment. She's been with us for a little while.	
3	Would the better use of language be a settlement agreement vs severance? Employer has 12 employees in PA and employee is on non-work related injury and cannot perform the essential functions of driving for an indefinite period.	
4	Have a follow up question on this. Better to ask employee questions about the claims that we heard or just fire her based on at will employment? We heard some rumors and we checked deeper into her previous employer. What if we later find that she has a conviction?	
3	Good afternoon, A client of ours had emailed us regarding an attachment from Indiana Dept. of Workforce Development about former employee who has filed a claim for unemployment benefits. She wants to know the proper steps to take if they DON'T want to fight the unemployment benefit to this former employee. She is so used to fighting it and sending it in. This time is a bit different. Is there any guidance we can share with our client? I wasn't sure how to attach the document so if it needs to be sent in, just let me know the best way to send it. Thank you, Leslie	
3	The question is about a potential staff termination. And would like some recommendation. Employee is slacking in their work. Every day is a crisis, health, kids, can't keep up with work. Going to terminate and we have documentation of numerous counselings regarding her deficient attendance and performance.	
1	We will be laying off a few employees based on business needs. Regarding severance, must we provide the same severance to all employees? If an employee has been with us for less than 60 days, must we give them a severance? Must we give them something in writing? Can we randomly choose who we want to lay off?	
4	We have an employee who has been with the company for about 30-45 days. She was involved in a vehicle accident and has not provided us with a any type of medical certification. She states that she is unable to come into the office to complete it. Can we give her a letter that states that if she does not provide the information with a specific amount of time, we will assume she has voluntarily resigned?	
3	Employee gave two weeks notice today but the client would like to accept it effective today, because of the sensitive nature of the employee's position. Coverage normally goes through the end of the month. Am I correct in thinking that the best approach is to continue coverage for today and tomorrow and then offer COBRA as of September 1st? The employee will show as terminated in the system effective today and they are not planning to pay out the notice period.	
2	Sample termination notices.	
1	We have an employee who has been her for about five months. Due to some theft, we did a background check on a particular employee and have determined that employment history was falsified. The employee made claims of being in law enforcement and that is not true. It appears he has criminal offenses as well. We are planning on terminating him. What are the risks?	
0	What is the Missouri law on employers paying out vacation when an employee resigns or is terminated?	
1	We are going to be doing a layoff of a significant part of our Wisconsin facility. The HR people are treating it as a temporary layoff though they are being terminated from the system. Our thought is that we hope to bring these people back in December but we are not sure.	
2	Do you have a severance checklist or things to consider when designing a severance package?	
1	An employee that we had to terminate today. We would like to offer him COBRA for a month. My understanding from an earlier RIF that because of the ACA and some issues, that we could not offer that correct? We want to offer to pay his COBRA for a month.	
4	I have an employee who sent resignation email this morning. She now wants to withdraw her resignation. can she request to have it withdrawn and we have a stay so to speak?	
6	Follow up to previous issue from today: If we do not have to pay final wages until next regular scheduled pay date, must we calculate the figures today to enter on to the separation notice?	
6	an employee resigned abruptly last night. How long do we have to provide the employee with her final pay check?	
2	Supplemental information concerning severance in relation to possible RIF.	
1	We are choosing not to have an employee who gave his notice work out his two week notice. But do we have to pay him for the full two week? Our policy states that we "may occasionally chose to pay an employee in lieu of notice, that is, not have the employee work out his/her notice period." My question is do we "have" to pay him/her the two week notice?	
3	I have a client in Minnesota who has over 100 employers in Minnesota. They assigned a tablet to an employee who was on a temporary assignment and who has not worked for them since January. They have employees sign an agreement that they will return the equipment in good order, otherwise they will charge for the employee for the damage. This individual has not returned a tablet that was given, and the tablet was damaged. The employer has not paid the employee their final wages. Can they tell the individual they must bring in the tablet before obtaining their final pay?	
4	We have an employee who is no longer an employee. 4/20 will be her final payroll. She was out for surgery and had no hours to deduct her medical insurance. When she came back we broke these deductions up based on her pay periods. She has one additional payment due after this pay period. Can we deduct for the balance due?	
1	We are having a layoff today, what is the 21 day requirement on waivers? Messaging to employees, any recommendations?	
2	We are letting one person over 40 go today. On the consideration period for a severance agreement is it 21 days?	
2	Thanks! There were also a couple of forms I had seen previously for the employee to sign based on if theyre voluntarily leaving vs. being terminated and the reason. Could you send those as well?	
4	An employee called out the day before her scheduled vacation, took vacation, and now, the day she's due back she's running late and said she'll be here when she gets here. I want to terminate.	
1	EE in AZ Gave a resignation notice and last day on 4/21st. Do I have to allow him to work through his notice period?	
1	We have a couple employees who gave notice saying April 21st would be their last day. We are pretty much closing the department and paying them through the rest of the week but we will be letting them go earlier. Would this still be a resignation?	
2	The employee I called about a couple weeks ago never brought in any documents for the Form I-9. What do I put in the termination notice.	
1	We have an employee who has had performance issues for a long time. I have written her up and I would like terminate. Can we do this?	
3	What is the proper language to use for an announcement of an employee that is no longer with the company?	
2	I need an Exit Interview form. Is there one on the site to model from?	
2	Would you tell me if there special requirements under Idaho and Utah for layoffs? Any special WARN requirements other than Federal? We are planing on laying off about 12 people in Utah out of 35.	
6	Waiting on a response from last week. Didn't receive it.	
6	Umi Kitchen; Khaoil Tawil. Unregistered client/user. We will be closing down. How will final wages be processed? Will COBRA be offered?	
5	We have a non-exempt, hourly truck driver who has not been to work for the last 3 weeks. This individual has been incarcerated with the following charges: Possession of Firearm by Convicted Felon 03/30/2017, Possession of Marijuana-Less Than 1 Oz., Theft By Receiving Property Stolen In Another State - Felony, Parole Violation. We have obtained this information from the county sheriff's office public records online. The employees girlfriend has been in contact with us and is saying the employee has a hearing coming up and they are hoping he can be bailed out. What rights do we, as the employer, have for obtaining information if he is released and wants to come back to work? Can we ask him for auth to perform an updated background check and MVR report? While he is unable to work, can we place him on leave and suspend his benefits? Is there a time limit for holding his job for him?	
2	Can you send me information on terminations in New York?	
3	One of our groups recently had to terminate a number of employees. After terming the first individual, they found some inappropriate communications through a messaging system on the company computers. The communication was detrimental to the company. They then termed the two others who were involved. Today, the HR person received a request from one of the individual requesting a documented reason as to why she was terminated. When asked why she told HR that she needed it for unemployment. Can you tell me if: In the state of Michigan, are they required to provide written documentation as to the reason for termination to the employee? and Does the unemployment office request that information from the employer directly?

6	HI, Unfortunately, we had an employee that passed away. I'm having to issue his final check but Im unsure of the process that needs to be followed to issue this in a way that covers all legal requirements; Im unaware of those besides what I have read online. I know he had a wife and a son from a previous marriage. Any advise on this will be appreciated... do I need to have her prove she is the one to receive his check? Does she have to sign a certain form in order to receive? I have processed his check as usual, including all unused vacation time but I did read something about not having to deduct Fed taxes.. Your help is appreciated.

1	An employee is on short term disability leave and his position has been selected to be eliminated due to a cut in our funding. How should we manage?	
0	When we terminate an employee we pay them their vacation time. My question is, should we be paying out all of their vacation time remaining for the year or should we only pay out the amount they would have accrued up to their termination date? We would like to know what State Law(MA) and Federal law states. Here is an example: Employee terminated on 3/24. Payroll occurred on 3/31. Was paid for all hours worked and had 20 vacation days in 2017 to use. Should the employee be paid out for 20 vacation days or what would have been accrued up to 3/24 (5.38 days)? We do give our employees access to all of their vacation time on 1/1 of that year and do not allow it to roll over. Our current policy in our handbook states "If you resign, with proper notice, you will receive payment of any unused vacation time on a pro-rated basis for the current calendar year." Thanks	
5	We had a guy fill out an employment application. We called his previous employer and he told us that one day he just didn't show up for work. When asked why he simply said he wasn't coming back. If we hire him can we tell him that he is on a 3 month probation and anytime during that 3 months we can let him go with no questions asked? We have not done this with any other hire and do not have this stated in our company policy.	
4	I have an employee that when hired, due to need, they offered her a deal where she would work full time during the school year, but only 10 hours a week over the Summer, but yet is paid the same amount every check. If we terminate her at the end of the school year (due to her way to high salary) do we owe her money for the Summer months?	
2	I have an exempt employee (manager) that will be terminated for not cause that resides in Connecticut and works in Massachusetts. What termination information do I need to supply him with? Thank you.	
4	We had an employee working part-time and the contract with that specific hospital ended and she wanted to stay on PRN but we ended up not needing her. We want to off board her but not terminate her. How do I complete the Georgia notice? She has other employment, we have given her other opportunities but her schedule hasn't lined up. She hasn't had availability at the times we needed it. She says she wants to stay on PRN. This is different from the other employee we have been calling about. How do we communicate the off boarding?

2	Will be terminating an employee in New Jersey. Are there any state-required forms I need to provide?	
6	I wanted clarification on what we should do as I'm getting push back from our payroll administrator regarding a final paycheck. We terminated an employee and he refused his final paycheck(s). Should we mail it out or keep it here for pick up?	
1	Please see below from our client and advise: Im the owner of a Pipeline Construction Company and our work comes in waves. Its common for us to get a big job, staff up to 30 or 40 employees, finish the job, and go back towards our normal core of 20 employees. Well, weve just completed a job and Im looking to lay off 8 extra hands for which we dont have the workload to keep busy. One of those employees, after being on the job for 4 days, hurt is finger. This happened about 3 weeks ago. He has since been on light duty with us, but I have every intention of laying him off alongside the other 7 employees I keep busy. Given that his WC claim is still ongoing, I wanted to make sure Im within my rights to do so.	
2	We plan on terminating an employee tomorrow and are considering offering severance. Do you have a sample agreement?	
1	Occasionally we give employee advances if someone is terminated how would we get the full amount back based on California laws about not not paying employees no less than half of wages or less than minimum wage.	
1	We are a sports media company and we have lost a few contracts. As a result we have to lay off some employee and reduce the pay of other employees by 10%. The employees whose pay is going to be reduced will get an additional 5 weeks off during the summer with pay. The impacted employees include exempt and non-exempt employees. We need to know if this is legal, and we will need some sample letter for the announcements/lay-off/severance.	
0	We have an office in CA. We have a situation where we have employees that have such a rich accrual rate for PTO (vacation/gift hours) and a personal day. Within the last year or so that if we were to lay them off we have to pay them for their vacation but also for their gift and personal date for their anniversary date. We give them a year to use the gift hours. Would those have to be added to her PTO upon termination for payout? We have an employee who has such a high cap for vacation. We know we have to pay their PTO on their last day of employment. Is there any way we can get around that to pay out over time?	
1	We need to know the proper steps for laying off a salary exempt employee in Texas.	
6	Following up on our previous call, what are the rules for equipment return and final pay for remote workers in non-California states?	
0	If we specifically state in our employee handbook that vacation will not be paid out at termination, does that over rule Louisiana's vacation payout law?	
3	Employer has counseled employee since March and has been meeting monthly. This is the end of the process and the employee has not demonstrated required progress so employer is ready to terminate for performance. Review with attorney just wanted to discuss options for separation.	
5	On Monday I received a notice from a manager to terminate an employee at the end of the week. We have received complaints from the client site where he's working and that client requested we remove him from the job. On Tuesday, he notified us that he had a work injury so a workers' comp claim was submitted. I think he got wind that there was a pending termination. Can we still terminate?	
1	We have an employee who has been with us 8 years in a sales manager position but is not performing well. We are inclined to offer him an alternative role. If he refuses the job, we were going to lay him off rather than fire him. In any case we've decided to have the VP of sales take over these duties rather than have a separate position. We are just wondering your thoughts about severance and whether you have a sample document?	
5	We have an employee who was on track to be terminated. He took off a couple days without authorization. When he was supposed to come in to return company equipment, he sent an email saying he has no ill will and will return his stuff but hurt his back two weeks ago. The termination was supposed to be for performance.	
4	We have a new hire who has only been with us for less than a month. She has been off work and in the hospital due to a serious medical condition. She does not know when she will be able to return to work. We are in need of this position and looking to replace her. What are the risks?	
0	Can our PTO policy state that we do not pay out unused paid time off at the end of employment?	
5	A Texas employee is temporary and we extended an offer to him, and he accepted. We started to see performance issues and errors. What are the risks with rescinding the offer? Monday was the start date. But I don't think the transfer took place.	
5	We recently hired an employee without first clearing his background. Upon further investigation, we discovered that he has several violation on his MVR and his driver licences is suspended. He is in San Francisco. At this point, can we terminate his employment. We require everyone in the position to have a valid drivers lic.	
2	Question in regards to offering COBRA as part of a severance agreement. Through our insurance broker who provides our health insurance, they provided a model letter, it states the terminating part would have to notify us within 30 days if they wanted to elect COBRA. Weve just been made aware that the company is going to offer to pay the first two months of COBRA when they separate on Friday. If they pay for the two months, shouldnt it read differently. If we tie the COBRA to the severance and release agreement, can you provide information? Can you please send us information about severance agreements that might include COBRA options?

6	Employee's last day is Sept 1 and coverage ends on the last day of the month following termination. Can employee take both September 6 and 20 employee premiums if employer get an authorization from the employee to make the second deduction from his final paycheck ($460 total for month).	
6	To Whom It May Concern, In addition to the request below, I would also like to know who to issue the employee's final paycheck to? The final paychecks issued to employees at the time of termination are always live checks, so in this particular case it would also be a live check, but need to know who should be the "Payable To". Thanks, Rita To Whom It May Concern, I recently had an EE unfortunately pass away in California. As we prepare his final paperwork, we've come across the fact that for his Life Insurance he's listed his Domestic Partner (DP), at 100%, but for his 401(k) benefit, he hasn't listed any Beneficiaries. So I need your assistance in understanding who would be eligible to receive his Life Insurance amount. Will it be his DP? If it is, will it be automatic? Or will his Estate receive his funds? For his 401(k) plan, who will be eligible to receive his funds? We don't know if the employee has any living siblings or parents, so we'd like to know how all his funds will be distributed. Please let me know if there's any questions. Thanks, Rita Sahakian Sr. HR Generalist [Sigma Designs] 47467 Fremont Blvd. Fremont, CA 94538 (510) 897-0130	
4	FMLA - eligibility requires 12 months employed, right? We have an employee who has not been here 12 months, was hired on 11/16/16. She is requesting 4 weeks leave for back surgery starting 9/25. We were planning to let her go, due to attendance, not working the hours the clinic is open. She said her attendance was partly due to her back, partly due to home situation, and partly due to our doctors schedule. She tried to file WC for the back surgery but was denied. She has disability benefits paid for by the company.	
4	An employee has given us her 2 weeks notice. However, she would like to go on vacation and then come back. She is stating that we are required to pay her 2 weeks since she gave us a notice. Is this true?	
4	We have a client who has an employee who is eligible for FMLA. She has asked for leave later this fall for surgery. They were going to terminate the employee, but will allow her to go on her leave, is there a timeframe for when they can terminate her upon her return?	
6	We have an employee who took 4 tires from a location we were doing detailing work. Can we deduct the cost of the tires from his final paycheck or hold his final paycheck until he returns the tires?	
4	How many days should be provided for recertifying FMLA? The employee wanted to change her leave to a complete leave and I have not heard from her since. I sent her a notice and that we would consider her non-communication job abandonment. Am I on the right track? This was as of the 18th. I tried to get in contact with her last week via phone and text. She is not responding.	
6	An employee's last day of employment is tomorrow. He has a personal loan and owes us a remaining $1100. Can we deduct that from his final pay, when doing so would leave him with a zero paycheck. How can we manage?	
3	Is there a time limit on keeping an employee after they return from FMLA leave?	
1	From : crystelsaturday@kms-technology.com Subject : Thank you for this information. Currently, our plan is 15 days per employee, so we have an amount they accrue. We currently have 3 employees in California plus our CEO. 2 of the employees have turned in notices in the pats few days so they will be gone, but we will still have one other employee, other than the CEO/co-founder who will be in California. How do we address the PTO section in our handbook to highlight that CA gets paid out their PTO upon termination? As we have it in there for rest who are GA employees that we do NOT pay out PTO. Thank you,	
4	Regarding a termination. we have a satellite office in San Antonio, Texas (8 total in TX)manager over there has married an employee (that is not the problem) and that employee is now becoming a problem. Employees are saying they are going to leave if she stays. She is taking advantage of being married to the boss. We were going either let her resign or discontinue her position. We don't have enough work currently for all the employees. She wrote a resignation letter to CEO saying she is being forced to resign and wants 6 months severance. We don't want to go that route. The manager is aware of the situation.	
0	If a person gives their two weeks and we terminate her sooner, do we need to pay out the two weeks? There is no documentation pointing otherwise. If we do not have a handbook and do not have documentation stating that you need to pay out sick time, are we mandated to? We have to pay vacation correct?	
3	Our client IMC has a severance package that continues salary and benefits for a few months after an employee is terminated. They want to know how they should code these employees in their payroll system. If they code them as terminated then they generate COBRA notices, but the other option is to keep them active when they aren't really active. Do you know what the industry standard is for this or if there are any specific requirements for categorizing these employees? PLEASE DO NOT RESPOND TO THE CLIENT, respond only to me. Thank you!	
4	We have a pregnant employee who is making lots of mistakes and is absent a lot. We would like to let her go. How do we go about doing that? Her errors include scheduling mistakes, errors in paperwork which are HIPAA violations, dress code violations, and she's missed 22 days of work.	
1	To whom it may concern, Is there anything that can be done contractually that allows our company to recover all company assets from an employee that has quit, prior to issuing them their final paycheck? We've had two instances where we have been unable to recover a company phone and iPad, and I'd like to make sure we are protected going forward. Please let me know what the options are in order to protect us.	
4	An employee resigned on August 26th. She has not returned the exit forms to us. We emailed and phoned her to remind her. Can we put more pressure on her and hold final pay until she gives us the paperwork? We are a government contractor and we need the conflict of interest form. It is also a security debrief with the security office. She attended the debrief and did not sign the paperwork.	
2	What termination paperwork is required for terminating employees in Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Illinois and Rhode Island. Specifically unemployment notifications, etc.	
1	if an employee gives 2 week notice today and we decide to let him go immediately do we need to pay the 2 weeks? This is in NJ	
2	An employee has chosen to resign after 30+ years of service. I may not have time today to collect a voluntary resignation letter from her today, as today is her last day.

5	We terminated an employee and he refused to take his final paycheck with him.

0	Is it a law in PA that PTO must be paid out upon termination? Can we pro-rate payment based upon anniversary date (when renewal would have occured) and termination date? If employee terms day after anniversary date then payout would be almost "0" horus for example and if term date was day before anniversary date - almost all remaining PTO would be paid out. Thank you for your assistance!	
3	We have an employee that has been out on leave since May. The employee is not returning to work by mutual agreement. We are providing the employee with a severance package. I would like to confirm information provided to me by Justworks. Do I have to pay a this exempt employee for wages in which she did not work.? The employee has not worked since May. In addition, JustWorks told me the employee was eligible for vacation accrual while on leave. Is that correct?	
4	We are in New Jersey. I have an employee who I need to fire. She is browsing the internet while at work. This is dishonesty and I would like to fire her. I do not need a policy on something like this I hired her to do a job and she did not do it. I don't have a progressive discipline process because I am a small employer.	
6	When it comes to employees returning equipment (uniforms and keys), what can the employer deduct from final wages if they don't return them? Would we be able to withhold the final paycheck until the items are returned? This is for the state of Indiana.	
4	As a follow up to our original question, the employee was not provided the option to resign. We had planned on laying her off, potentially it was discussed that she should have the option of gracefully resigning and she took that to mean were attempting to not pay her UI. She provided a resignation letter and requested 6 months severance.	
6	Looking for "best practice" for employee final pay when requested on last day. We cut checks in advance based on "projected hours" for last shift. If an employee works more hours than scheduled, what is the best way to handle the extra pay. Do we provide the employee with the check that was based on the schedule and cut a check for the additional hours on the next business day or do we need to find a method to pay the additional hours at the end of the shift (when Payroll Dept is not available)? Or another option? Thank you. Diane Schmidt

2	Upon filing for unemployment, an employee that we terminated in New Jersey was told that "I may have been separated for misconduct in connection with my work.". My understanding is that this is STANDARD in New Jersey, based on the information on their DOL website that states "If you were fired or discharged from your job you may be disqualified from collecting benefits. A claims examiner will determine if there was any type of misconduct connected to your separation," on their Requirements for Payment Fired (Discharged) Page "http://lwd.dol.state.nj.us/labor/ui/aftrfile/fired.html." Can you confirm that this practice is standard in NJ? Thank you	
2	bradserlis@yahoo.com Concerns about being laid off.	
1	One of the employees that was offered another position with the new company is giving us a hard time about this and making it very uncomfortable for us. We want to give him 2 weeks pay advance and not have him at our location and just have him start at the other job in Feb. Are we allowed to do that? We just want to be done with him.	
5	We have been trying to send a last check for an employee who resigned with the company last year in September. Initially, seeing that he was not going to come into the office to pickup his check, we mailed his check. However, the paycheck was returned because the address he provided on all his forms was not valid. I was able to speak with him once and he told me that he would figure out what address he wanted to send his check to and that he would get back to me. I have yet to find out what address to send this check to. I want to know if there's any way we can be protected in case this person tries to claim back wages. If he is not getting back to me after constantly seeking him, when can we as the employer just stop?	
1	Termination: We have an employee that we put on a leave of absence layoff in September and we originally told him we will need him back in March. We will not be needing him back due to now work and we want to terminate him. Is his termination date effective today or back in September?	
4	With Shaulene on the phone. An employee has been with us for approx 3 years. Recently her work performance has significantly deteriorated.

Can we terminate her? Will she be able to collect UI?	
0	Our handbook states that employees who resign with two week's notice, will be paid out any unused vacation time as long as the employee has been employed with the company for one year. I know that state laws dictate vacation payout. Can you tell me the state laws regarding vacation payout for Missouri, Illinois, and Kansas? Also, we were wondering if we could pro-rate the payout based on when the employee resigns? We had an employee resign this month and obviously he hasn't used any vacation, so he is going to get paid out for two weeks of vacation. Obviously, we can't do anything about the policy on this one, but for the future, could we pro-rate based on when they resign?

We are facing financial difficulties, and will not have any work for her for a period of time. Can we keep her on but advise that we will not be sending her any work for a while? We did have another layoff event earlier in the year. At that time we were able to provide severance through an objective severance plan. Because of our poor financial status, we cannot provide severance with this new round of layoffs. Are we obligated to provide the same severance?

3	We recently terminated a white male production supervisor who is 53 years old with 13 years of service . The reason on the separation notice was "job performance does not meet company expectations". A verbal explanation was given that included: - Treatment of employees not in line with the Company Core Values (was disrespectful and demeaning to employees, yelling, etc.) - Frequent unplanned absences from work - Lack of respect and credibility of co-workers - Unresolved quality issues in his department There were complaints of sexual harassment and people reporting that they had smelled alcohol on his breath but we felt there were enough reasons for the termination without identifying those as reasons for the separation. I have received the attached detailed questionnaire from the MN Unemployment Insurance department asking for a detailed response regarding the reasons for the separation. I would prefer not to complete the attached and we are willing to have the unemployment charged against our account. My question is - does it look bad if we don't respond? Is not responding a negative for the Company if he files a lawsuit against us?

1	I'm considering terminating several employees and this will be our first such terminations. I want to make sure I've covered everything necessary in the process. We are based in Buffalo and have about 20 employees but we also have a small office in CA with 3 people. We are going to shut down the office but will potentially keep one or more of the staff to work remotely. The closure is primarily due to business operations (the performance of these particular employees is unfortunately not enough to sustain an additional physical location). They are all in a protected class based on race, gender or race (or a combination of these). All the employees are at will. What do we need to be aware of?	
1	Hello, We are looking at a couple of different options in restructuring Environmental Services Department. We are opening a new building soon and have merged the job duties so that all housekeeping, laundry, Custodial personnel are all hired under the position title of Envrionmental Services Specialist. Some employees in the department have been with the company 10+ years and have poor attitudes and are major contributors to low morale in the department. We would like to eliminate these individuals from the organization and we are not sure how to do it. One idea was to terminate them based on the fact that we are eliminating their positions due to restructuring the department. What are the considerations that I need to make prior to eliminating a person's position in this scenario? Are we required to offer severance? The other Idea that we are entertaining is taking employees with poor attitudes through the progressive disciplinary process.

Should we have him come into work tomorrow and terminate him immediately. I don't want him to be put to work. If we call him today and tell him he is terminated can we pay him tomorrow? What about the holiday pay for Monday, do we have to pay him for that?

The employee who is a bartender aggressively and angrily approached the manager during the meeting with what she thought should be corrected by marketing in front of vendors. the employer was advised by the marketing manager that she would respond to her by email however the employee continued to be aggressive and confront the marketing manager. Marketing manager filed a complaint. Subsequent to that interaction there was another incident in which she was aggressive with another employee two times. Although he complained about he grabbing a paper from him when he was on shift he did not want to file a complaint however when she approached him and told him she was "subsidizing the employee because he is taking her shifts" in an angry manner in front of a customer he then filed a complaint about the two incidents. What are the repercussions of termination vs final warning?

1	At Campus Kitchen, we hire per semester, we do not holdover employees, they complete a new application for return each new semester, as we have a pretty big turnover with students. We do have some regular employees that will return. This semester, we had three employees that we have not heard from. We kept their files open for rehire. School started and we have not heard from them. Their last pay date was June 23, 2017. What are we required to do? We created a letter stating they did not re-apply for open positions, and now all are filled, and there are no hours available. Do we need to provide any paperwork?

He has come back with a doctor's note stating he can return to work, but he has not been back in 2 years and we don't have a position for him. We really don't want him back.

4	We had an employee provide a verbal resignation on Tuesday. She gave a one month notice at that time. Our policy states we need to get this in writing. We advised her of this, and reminded her when we did not get it. We still had not received a resignation, and when we reminded her, she indicated that she wanted to wait out the time until January. We have already acted on her initial notice, and have moved her accounts. When we called in earlier we were advised to draft a separation letter, outlining her verbal notice on Tuesday.

4	We have an employee who went to her desk yesterday morning at 7:20. We have it on video footage that she entered the building and walked straight to her desk and didn't clock in. When we asked her about it she said she arrived and started working at 7 am. We asked her when she sent her first email and she said it she didn't start sending emails right away, so it was sometime after 7. When we checked with IT, they verified that her first email was sent at 7:24am. There is video footage that shows she came in at 7:20 (but 6:20 without the new time change reflected). We have had issues with this person not clocking in. Every pay period Ive had to adjust her time card as she isnt clocking in correctly. She says she forgets. But yesterday we feel this is time card fraud and we want to move forward with termination.	
4	We have a full time employee who put in her resignation letter and offered to stay on as a PRN. Based on her taking on work with a competitor, we decided not to accept that option. We sent an email to her personal email thanking her for the offer of staying on in a different capacity but we don't feel that we are going to go forward with that at this time. We're not sure if she got the email and sent her a letter as well. Should we call her?	
4	We have an employee that worked with our company, but worked remotely in PA. She complained loudly that the drive was way too far for her. To help accommodate the costs of her commuting, we bumped up her salary up by $6000. She commuted to the office, which is what we need, as the work at this point really needs to be done from the office and not remotely. This arrangement lasted about one week and she started working from home again. We told her that we are requesting that she come into the office to perform her work. She is declining saying its too hard on her health. We told her that if you arent going to come into the office, we are going to remove the $6000 we had provided as a commuting assistance and that if you have medical reasons that require accommodation, we would be happy to consider that. We provided her the FMLA paperwork and her 15 day deadline for returning it was today. Instead of returning the paperwork, she said Im quitting. She has all of our company equipment. Can we require her to bring her company equipment back to the PA office?	
5	It's regarding termination and if somebody gets hostile about it. We hired someone last week. Over the weekend, he was acting strangely and said some things that were inappropriate. This week the General Manager told him he was going to release him and the employee questioned why. The GM told him some of the reasons, including that it was not a good fit at this time. The GM also included some statements made by other employees about the comments made by the The employee told him he didn't have the story right and that the GM should investigate. We did and found that the employees and club member had also heard the statement. The employees have written statements and the GM has written a statement about what the club member said. He made comments: In regards to the rain and changing weather tell those f-ing monkeys..." and also told the female employee, his deceased wife overdosed on drugs 4-5 years ago, she reminds him of her figure. The ex employee has threatened slander. The GM assured him it wasn't slander as it was only between him and the GM and that it was about it not being a good fit.

5	We have a husband and wife both employed by our company. Both individuals have been counseled in the past for poor work performance. The male employee is a delivery driver and his FL license was revoked and we were fined $500 because he was caught driving with the revoked license. We required him to go to the NC DMV to get a valid license and he has not gone. In the meantime, he is performing job duties that really are not necessary, like emptying the trash and other minor duties. The female employee has a history of poor customer service and poor attitude. As we are considering cutbacks and the overall performance of these two individuals, we would like to let them both go. Please advise.

1	Hello. We recently had to restructure one of our departments and all employee's in this business unit (5 total) were notified that their positions would be eliminated as a result of the restructure. We created (2) new positions that were of an advanced level and encouraged those who met the qualifications and requirements to apply, and we opened this position to the remainder of the organization as well. We had 3 internal staff submit interest and interview, and we also interviewed 2 external candidates. We would like to select (1) existing staff from the business unit that is being eliminated and (1) from a different area of the business. The last internal candidate who also currently works in the soon to be eliminated unit, appears to be qualified on paper and has familiarity of the function, but not at the advanced level and therefore we will not be offering her a position. I want to make sure there aren't any additional concerns we should be thinking through related to this?

2	We are letting an employee go. We are offering a severance agreement. Can you please send me a template and any termination forms?	
1	It looks like we are going to do some job eliminations, doing away with the positions altogether. Each of the individuals holding each separate job has a different and unique job title, and they are the only one holding that position. The three jobs being considered for elimination are all in the warehouse, but are different. One is held by a female, latina, over age 40 who is pregnant. She is the only one that holds that particular position. Shes been with the company since 2014. He position is getting absorbed into another position which will be a combo job. The other two distinctly unique jobs are held by males, they are both minorities (Latino), we aren't sure if either is over age 40. As a leadership team, we have been discussing this possibility for a couple of weeks and the reason is completely business related. Each of the three employees will be able to apply for other jobs within the company. Should we give them severance? They want to execute the position eliminations on Monday. (Issue 2 of 3)

0	Our client has a PTO policy that the hours are "advanced' on January 1 for the year but are accrued per pay period based on years of service. Handbook policy states that any used but not accrued PTO taken at the time of termination will be deducted from the employee's final pay. The client is having a reduction in force of 15 employees. Many have exceeded their accrued PTO. Some of the employees are salary. Each employee is being offered a severance package of 2 weeks pay. Are there any issues under these circumstances with deducted the PTO that was taken but not accrued? Does the same apply for salary exempt and non-exempt employees? Thank you.

4	I had an employee who I thought had violated our policy on non-solicitation and she admitted it during our meetings. She had worked for a client under the table. My intention was to suspend to give myself time to do my due diligence and then terminate but within the hour of our meeting ended she called in to our scheduler and then to me with a verbal immediate resignation. I accepted and told her I needed her time sheets so I could process her final check. I also reminded her that she needed to return some company property. The next day she called in saying she wanted to rescind her resignation and use sick time. I told her that was not acceptable and reiterated that I needed her time sheets. I would like to discuss how to handle this request to rescind.

5	An employer had an employee who went into a drug rehab during a work day. The employee was out of work for 3 months and then never returned to work. The employee has recently requested money from his profit sharing. The employee still owes the employer the medical insurance contributions from the 3 months and his uniforms. Can the employer request them from him now and could the employer deduct it from the profit sharing refund to the employee? The employee is no longer employed. The company is seasonal and went into a layoff and during that layoff they learned the employee was quitting while they were off. The company feels very taken advantage of. After a couple of months they had to put him on COBRA (he did not elect) and he told them he would not be returning. He recently asked for profit sharing, which comes from the company based on longevity. He has been a long term employee and he wants to receive that profit. The company wants to speak their piece that they were more than kind and he asking for additional money. They want to send him a letter and will honor the request and that he owes the premiums and uniforms and that they would honor the profit sharing request.

3	A client operates in Louisiana and has a contract employee who will disappear for two days then come back to work. The employee confessed he was in jail, but later disclosed he is struggling with a heroin addition. The employer then drug tested them and the test was negative.

They want to terminate this employee or drug test 3 times a week. This employer has well over 50 employees, maybe 100. I am not sure how long this individual has been employee - likely over a year. I think they are treating the employee like an independent contractor.	
4	We released an employee yesterday and she has come back asking for our reason why. We are an at-will employer and she was let go for failing to meet our expectations. Can we simply state this? There are other issues at hand, such as the employee filed complaint against us, informed us at time of termination she had a work-related injury and her son was a former registered child here, however was expelled due to use of profanity and flashing the bird (the child is 10). Our reason for termination was not related to any of these incidents, rather in observing her with the classroom children, she was very cold and not friendly to our patrons.

We were off on Monday (a paid holiday) but she has called in sick Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. I just received a resignation email from her copied below: "I wanted to give you my resignation in person, however, I'm out with strep throat. Just my luck. Thank you for everything.. If you need me next week, let me know. I can still work a week to better prepare for my exit." In light of the above, i wanted to know what my wage responsibilities (payments) to her are? In other words, when is the last day i should pay her through? On September 1st (the last day she was physically here), she had 9.75 of sick hours available to her. Secondly, are we required to pay her 2 weeks? Or, can I comply with her request and accept her resignation today as the last day of employment? I hope i'm making sense. Thanks, Fred

He was trying to manipulate a document that we have to give to the SEC; he was putting the company at risk and against my will he submitted a document to the compliance group against what I had directed. He was supposed to secure client documents and a company check and he had them all out on his desk, he knows that he should not do this as there is personal information on this documents.

The last thing I need is any form of litigation. So heres my question. Should I terminate her today and be done with it.

It is clear to us that the employee who we just hired is running circles around the other employee. She does not seem to be catching on even after a month of training. We want to terminate her employment. Would we need to go through the usual termination process if she has only been here for a month?	
5	Im preparing a termination paper and would like some advice. Male employee has been written up 2 times for misconduct, violation of policy and attendance. Following the last disciplinary meeting he production was horrible only 8 parts produced when normally the level is around 100 pieces. If the issue was with the machine, he should have told supervisor. This morning, the employee was told about unacceptable production. He responded with foul language and was moved to other area. He refused to do the work, said he was leaving early due to a tooth ache. Supervisor told him to go. Can I call it "job abandonment" because he left early?	
5	We have an employee who has told his manager he is resigning because he has a new job but he is refusing to turn in his resignation in writing. What are our options?	
2	My position is being eliminated at the association. I'm looking language for the agreement - if foundation was pay for COBRA premiums.	
5	Our customer sent this. .Last week we discovered that one of our granite fabricators was falsifying his time by not clocking out until hes at home. (I can tell where they are when they clock in or out.) He had been doing that virtually every day since July 13th. Prior to that date, his clock outs were always either at the shop or within a mile or two. And he was never the last one in the shop. He always left either before or around the same time as the other fabricators.... Until July 13th. So when I went back and estimated what time he should have been clocked out, it turns out he stole over $1200 in time. He has a check coming on the 15th for a full two weeks of work. I asked our attorney and he just said you arent required to pay for falsified time sheets. However, I dont think its that simple. I need some guidelines for Kansas law and what I can legally withhold from his last check. If you could send something I can use to show him why I do not have to pay him.	
2	I just had an employee resign. What paperwork is Nichols Fire & Security, LLC required to file or provide for terminated employees?	
4	We're considering termination of a teacher but I'm not sure which reason to use. We can process as a RIF since we truly need to let someone go due to low enrollment or we're considering insubordination. She has been refusing to do tasks related to her job. She has also been sending out group emails to some of her colleagues trying to get a rise out of them - saying they're not appreciated or treated well, etc. She also makes negative comments about her job on social media. What reason do you think I should use?	
3	If we require our employees to take one furlough day a week (or every 2 weeks), can they apply for unemployment for those days? Also in the past, the company has also required employees to take the working day before or after a holiday without pay and without using PTO. Can we continue to do this?	
5	We have an employee who gave notice on Tuesday 9/5 for 9/9, but has only called in sick since he worked on Tuesday. Are we required to pay him those days?	
5	I have an employee who now has had a second accident within the past 3 months. He failed to get a post-accident drug screen done after both injuries and we have a policy that states he must get one. And now if I terminate him for failure to get a drug screen, will that look like retaliation for having so many accidents?	
3	If an employee voluntary resigns can their manager legally tell them not to communicate their resignation with any one in the company?	
3	In the State of Texas, fully-insured health plans will end at the end of the month upon termination of employment. What does an employer do about the employees portion of the premium that he or she would if he or she should term at the beginning of the month?	
1	We have an employee coming up on the 90 day mark next week. He is not working out, so we are planning on terminating his employment. Should we tell him now that this will be happening next week, or just move forward with the termination next week?	
1	We have an employee who is on leave but business needs dictate that the position be eliminated. Is there a requirement in California that the termination be done face to face.	
5	We had an employee arrested on our property today. He was accused of trying to break in to a vehicle and stabbed someone in the parking lot. He was hiding on the roof and when he jumped down the cops arrested him. He resisted arrest and one of our supervisors had to help the cops detain him. I am not sure what to do a this point. Can we term him based on what has happened even if he hasn't been (or doesn't get) convicted of the crime? We do not feel comfortable with him in our facility and are concerned that he may be mad at the supervisor for helping the cops detain him. We have already deactivated his badge access based on this.

4	Incident happened this morning, an employee experienced arm and chest pain. We called emergency services and an ambulance came. We now understand it may have been anxiety attack. We think we should document or something - what should we do? She has given us two weeks notice as she found a better opportunity. She has been experiencing life challenges and needed to make more money.	
3	When we terminate an employee (or if they resign), if we have PTO due to them that takes them past the end of the month, would we need to continue with their benefits?	
4	We have a new employee and she is just not cutting it in any department. We have talked to her and moved her. Now we want to know what to do with her? I am assuming that we should write her up?	
5	We have an employee who has been out of for over four days. We tried calling and finally he sent an email on the fourth day that he has been ill due to a sinus infection. We are thinking of letting him go. Would like some feedback on possible risks.	
1	Hello, We let a couple of employees go on Friday and are going to provide them 4 weeks of severance pay. What is the best or most common method of doing this? Do we pay them as normal through our bi-weekly direct deposit process or pay it out via check at one time? I wanted to get advice on that and know what other employers typically do.

3	Can an employer in Boca Raton, FL require one of their workers to come back to work tomorrow even though they've evacuated at the urging from the governor? Is there any employee protection in this situation if the employer were to terminate employment?	
5	We have an employee who provided a doctors note last week to be on a medical leave for three weeks. Since we have received that doctors note he has posted negative things on our company Facebook page and written hostile emails to us as well as make phone calls/text messages to other employees and even found phone numbers of employees spouses. In our handbook we have a section on Standards of Behavior that are unacceptable and he has had many of these unacceptable behaviors in the last week since he left on medical leave. Would this be grounds for termination? Many of us feel unsafe with his actions. If we are able to terminate him during his short medical leave should we be sending him a certified letter stating he is no longer employed? Any help/guidance would be appreciated.	
5	An employee that has worked here for some time with no write-ups since 2014. We are having issues in how he interacts with patience cursing and making derogatory comments. He has been through three different department managers that spoken to him and it has been going for several years. He gets better and now he is doing it in the presence of the patients. When addressed he states that he knows and needs to quit. It was annotated on his last performance evaluation. We do have a written complaint from a patient. We were very apologetic. He yelled at her and told her that she could not use that restroom and he stated that they needed to clean up her father's shit because it was not a hotel. I also heard from another manager that he made a comment about having to move a patient. Can we terminate him?	
0	We have an employee in California who resigned. She is asking about her accrued PTO. Our policy states this will be forfeited if the employee leaves the company.	
5	On behalf of R W International: We have an employee who went on Work Comp in mid-August. We are not subject to FMLA due to our size and his absence is causing some undue hardship. We were initially told that he could return to work at the end of September, but now that's looking more like the end of October. Can you tell me how long I have to leave this job open for this employee? What obligations do we have to this employee when he is released to work, with or without restrictions?

1	We have two employees who have resigned and will be leaving before the 2016 profit sharing payout., The offer letter states they will receive the annual bonus. We haven't finished financials from 2016. We are wondering legally what we would have to pay these employees?	
2	We issued a separation agreement to an employee that's over 40 years of age. We miscalculate the 21 days using calendar days versus business days. Either way, the period for him to respond has passed and he has failed to respond. Do you think we should sent out a revised document?

May I review our termination letter with you.

"In New York, are employers permitted to withhold pay from an employees final paycheck for used, but not accrued vacation time? For example, if an employees annual allotment of vacation is 3 weeks and he uses 2 in January and quits in February, can we deduct from his final paycheck for the amount that hadnt been accrued yet?"	
4	A former employee was terminated in November for taking business away from the company and keeping it for herself. She had had a workers' comp claim the year before that was approved and the following year we terminated her. She filed a claim stating wrongful termination but it was termination for violation of our noncompete policy. How should we handle this?	
0	our policy is that someone must give two weeks notice in order to get paid any accrued vacation. If we want to let them go early, do we still have to pay them the two weeks of pay?	
5	We have an employee who was over paid in error. He failed to submit his time sheet so we paid his standard number of hours. He then confirmed he did not work 40 hours, only 10. We would like to recover the over payment. From this next check he'll only be paid 10 hours again so will will recover that. I'm not sure how many he will work in the following check and we plan on terminating. Can we issue a negative check?

5	We had an employee that called at 3:30 am and told us that he had an emergency. Unfortunately he had all the keys to the client. He told us that he would be leaving the set of keys at his house in a specific place and when we went there, they were in his locked car. We had to call all the clients and let them know that this was happening. It was a huge disruption to the operation. We don't completely believe his story as there was many inconsistencies in his story. We would like to fire him.

1	In relation to our sales force, we have had three people resign in the last month. They give us two weeks notice but we generally don't need to retain them for that period of time so it doesn't make sense to keep them on (particularly because our CRM addresses any hand off issues). All three provided a formal resignation and gave us two weeks notices. We mutually agreed that it probably didn't make sense to continue working. Do we have to pay them out for their notice period because we accepted their resignation early?

4	We have a full time employee who is putting in her resignation, resigning on the 17th of January. Now she has since said that she will stay on as a part-time, non-regular hours as she can to help until her replacement is hired and trained. We want to talk about benefits, vacation and sick accrual, and how to manage the change. Also she is requesting her vacation be paid out and that is against our company policy, unless a termination takes place. In this case, it has not, she has just extended her resignation date and we are changing the terms of her employment to accommodate part-time work until a new resignation date.	
2	Thanks - which of the three attached separation / termination letters do you recommend? Also - is the fact that she is over 40 relevant to the language of the letters?	
4	If an employee gives a verbal 2 week notice and it is on camera/video is that considered a valid resignation. Do they have to accept that? An employee likes to cry wolf a lot. She is now saying she did not say that. We want to accept that resignation. She is denying the resignation occurred.

What should we send/email/mail, form wise? When is final pay due? Should I send her an email too, to let her know the check is coming? Do you recommend keeping it pretty dry or saying we're sorry it worked out this way? How do you handle disparagement? Do you have a sample? Do we owe any pay beyond today?

1	My company is thinking of hiring a new employee to replace an employee. I want to get some guidance on termination. The employee is performing ok but we interviewed someone we think will support the company better now and in the future. If we terminate the current employee and say it is a layoff. He was on a final written warning a month or two ago but there has been improvement. Can we call this a layoff?	
3	We are a retailer and wanted to know if there are specific states that require payout after termination date. Basically our field employees are on commission and we are about to implement a policy that if they are terminated at the time of commission payout (usually after the month closes) they are not eligible for commission earned. I believe California stipulates that they employees must be compensated for anything earned while they were actively working regardless of term date. Please advise. Thank you, Elizabeth

4	I have staff I am having issues with. She has been with me a year and four month. At 90 days she was doing fine. We were renovating and did not do a 12 month review. I realized that she was not up to speed in her job. When she asked to get licensed from Customer Service to Sales Representative I asked the supervisors and the floodgates opened. She agrees that her performance is not up to par. She has a passive aggressive personality. She has a temper. One of my staff has been asking her not to wear perfume that she is allergic to and she then began wearing more perfume. On Friday she started texting me to call my clients. If a client needs to speak to me I need details and she is not providing these and states that if I do not care about my clients that is on me. She sent me three texts to call clients. She is clearly trying to get fired. She hung up on me three times. We sent her a long letter for her to read and think over; stating that she needs to learn what she does not know or we will accommodate her schedule to allow her to look for another job. Should I let her go and collect unemployment? We have had mostly verbal conversations with her, then a sit down and then we recapped with an email. We are in the process of hiring and she texted others asking why we are hiring. We are behind in our work and need more people to help. The work that she did last week was almost all wrong. She is black. The girl that we are hiring is black.	
3	I've got a sales team that follows their own system for reviews. 1st 30 days of goals, training 60 days again 90 days again 60 days is optional. The form they use has a line that says review dealer map... in different color, "this is what we talked about..." The goals are intermixed and the summary is at the bottom, but there is no language with requirements and no consequences. Then, sales want to know how to document when sales are crappy. Do we have to have this summary statement? The former employee in this territory wants to return to the role.	
5	Hello! In Illinois, we hired an employee and provided a one-time sign-on bonus which he received at the time of employment. His offer letter stated that if he was to leave within one year of his hire date, he would be required to repay the sign-on bonus. In Illinois, are we allowed to deduct this from his final paycheck? If not, then we will probably provide him a letter requesting the repayment of the sign-on bonus. Any leads from an Illinois Law perspective would be appreciated. Thank You!	
5	Follow up to question last week. Employee requested FMLA, I gave him medical forms, sent certified. He didn't receive until the deadline. I gave him an extension to today. He emailed some documentation. Form was barely filled out. Medical certification he sent in is totally unrelated to his original statement for need for leave. The doctor just excused him for this past week, not the former three weeks. Am I in the wrong that if he doesn't certify the three weeks, can we let him go.	
4	We have an employee who we are letting go. She's not been working to our standards and parties have not been put together properly. When we let her go we may be reorganizing her department. Would it be best to not mention the reorganization? What would be the affect to her receiving unemployment? If we have her come in tomorrow, should we pay her for that time? She's exempt.

From an Illinois Wage Law perspective, if we provide a candidate/new employee with a sign-on bonus and include reimbursement language if they leave within 1 year, can we deduct this bonus from their final paycheck if the candidate/new employee signs the reimbursement letter? Thank you.

4	We have an employee in California - after she was hired, we ran the background. She has a felony (paroled in 2012) and I did a pre-adverse letter so she could go in and challenge whether its accurate and she got the FCRA notice. It has been 20 days and she has not contacted them (the service). On her application, she checked she did not have a felony. We want to talk to her about it so we can come up with a plan B. The service has checked this 3 times to confirm the conviction the disposition date was 2009, 2007 for the case filing. 3 year sentence suspended and paroled through 2012. She is at a desk placing orders. I do not know how much customer information she has access to.

5	Our client has an employee with a disability situation. Their employee has been off on STD effective 08/01. They have been approved by their Dr. through 08/15. However, their disability has not been approved beyond 08/15 until he sees a specialist. Disability has been trying to reach him and he is not responding. Apparently, he has an appointment with a specialist Mid September. Disability is basically saying that they will be closing his file if he does not respond back. The employer has been paying his Insurance Premiums the entire time he has been off and treating him as if he is on disability, even if he has not been approved. They want to know at what point are they able to terminate his employment. As of right now, he is not approved for Disability past 08/15. However, if he sees the specialist Mid September, he could be approved again. Nobody can get a hold of him to know what is going on.	
3	via email: Hello, We have a new employee who lives and works in Georgia that is already demonstrating performance deficiencies. He is an African-American male in his mid- to late-twenties, and his start date was in early August of this year (approx. 6 weeks ago).

At the end of this review period, Employee will be advised, in writing, whether Employer desires to continue with its at-will employment relationship with Employee. 8.0 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California. Please let us know if, based on Section 2.0 above, we can terminate him within the 90-day window without going through a Performance Improvement Plan process, and what steps we might need to take before any involuntary termination of his employment. Thank you.	
3	I need explanation for waiting time pay. Specifically how it is calculated.

5	Hello, We have an employee who has been with the company for 5 1/2 months. He received training that is unlike any other training we have had at Castle. He was part of a 6 week Sales Management Trainee program and is now on the job. There has been issues of him possibly leaving early, taking lunches at unapproved time, etc. Some conversations have been had with him. He has used up all of his PTO (including 3 hours of unexcused/unapproved time). In addition, he is the lowest performer of the group and the Management team is ready to terminate. As far as progressive discipline goes, he is on a Verbal Warning for attendance issues (hoping to get a Written and possibly Final Written Warning for attendance today). Our question is, would it be ok to terminate based on the information above or should we continue with the Progressive Discipline for performance or possibly a 30 day PIP? Please advise, thank you!	
2	Regarding termination comp pay in regard to severance checks and what taxes we are able to withhold	
4	We have an employee with whom we have had a number of issues, Some of them are outlined below: We asked her if she could work overtime. She become very combative and abusive in refusing to work overtime. Had she simply provided a legitimate reason there would have been no reason, but she erupted and it ended badly. Co-worker accused her to sexual harassment because she was behaving in a sexual manner. She was making sexual comment and gestures. We conducted a full investigation and found the allegations to be true. When we spoke with her, she demanded to know who had made the allegations, and refused to sign anything. She does not come to work due to illness. We do not have an issue with illness or the use of paid sick time, but she doesn't call until hours into her shift. When her supervisor asked her to please call so that we would know that she was okay, she erupted again and started screaming and crying in the office. We would like to terminate her employment at this point.

5	We have an employee who has been out since 8/30. We have been communicating with his via email. I told her that after three days, we need a note and we have not received one. He said he can not afford to go to the doctor's for another two weeks. I would like to terminate. Can we terminate him and not pay benefits for this month?	
1	We have an employee in New York who we are letting go. His manager is flying out in order to conduct that termination meeting.

1	We have temp workers in multiple states. They work through agencies and when we release them to the agency we are often a bit vague as to the reason. Our onsite HR managers will state, they don't need the temps do to performance, business needs, or conduct issues. Do we need to provide a detailed reason? We have the temps contacting us directly with questions as to why they have been terminated?

5	An employee of us last Friday decided to take some beers while driving back from one of our job sites in TN to GA. He was driving one of our company trucks under the influence and got in an accident where he basically destroyed another car. No one seems to be hurt so far. Our employee was arrested for DUI and released Saturday morning. Yesterday he was called in the office and terminated for not following our policies and the damages caused. Can we withhold his paycheck to cover for expenses incurred due to the accident? If so, can we withhold without discounting the federal/state taxes since those are not actual taxes but merely withholding money?

4	Maria Lewis, practice manager. Need help with current employee and possible termination. 202.822.8777 Employee has been here since February 2015. She went on maternity leave last year, and returned PT temporarily, was supposed to come back FT but never has increased her hours. She is also habitually late. She is now pregnant again. She requested to continue working PT until November when she goes out for the second baby. We agreed and she began to train someone else to take over her role. She hasn't been keeping any agreements. We experienced some business shifts and communicated necessary schedule changes for all employees. I talked with her about the change in her schedule. She did not like it and confronted the doctor, got belligerent. This occurred last Friday. Meanwhile, with her being out of the office, we reviewed her work and noticed things have been reported as done but they aren't. We also saw evidence of personal business during work. Im wondering if I have enough to let her go.	
3	Client had employee they terminated (laid off) and they want to pay for COBRA for a few months. Is there a best practice in how to do this? If they covered the COBRA premium, would that be taxable to the former employee?	
3	I have a client who has employees in all 50 states. We wanted to know if there are specific states that require payout after termination date. Basically their field employees are on commission and they want to implement a policy that if they are terminated at the time of commission payout (usually after the month closes) they are not eligible for commission earned. I believe California stipulates that the employees must be compensated for anything earned while they were actively working regardless of term date. Also, if you had a termination chart by state that would be great.	
5	I have a New York small group with medical dental vision. He was already enrolled in all three lines of coverage. On Sept 1 he gave resignation. All three carriers said that he has coverage through the end of the month. The group doesn't want to pay for the full month. Can we say that the resignation date is August 31st? He worked on September 1st. Is it different if he only worked half a day?

5	Hello, Question: We have an employee that was terminated due to a spill he caused due to his carelessness. We had to hire another company to clean up the spill (we have not received an invoice from them yet but we know it's going to be over $1000.). We have a deposit from him for the company cell phone that was lend out to him ($300.) we also have a signed form by him that says that money will be returned to him if he turns in his cell phone (which he did turn in his cell phone), would it be legal if we were to keep that deposit to help pay off that invoice for the cleaning of the spill that he caused? Thanks, Diana Salazar	
4	We terminated an employee last week and she is asking for the reason for termination in writing. It was insubordination. She was asked to complete certain tasks and she did not complete them.

4	We have an employee who only worked 4.75 hours and quit. She needs charged for her drug test. Her gross pay is above minimum wage 43.94 but once the deduction and taxes are taken from her check her net pay is only $6.58. Is this OK?

5	We have an employee taking FML for their own medical condition. The employee was released to return to work at full duty 9/5/2017. A few days later the employee started missing again. He left work early 9/7/17. He indicated he wasn't feeling well due to his condition. He called in sick 9/8, 9/11, and 9/12. On 9/12 the employee called and stated that he will not be able to return to work ever. He said his doctor informed him he his no longer able to work. It's my understanding that once an employee indicates they are no longer able to return to work, that our obligation to provide FML ends at that point. Is that accurate?	
4	An employee gave her 2 weeks resignation letter. Our manager didn't give her the final check on her last day; her last day was Saturday. She called today asking for her check and also compensation for the delay. We are in SF. What is the penalty owed and how it is calculated? Thanks	
5	Union employees - my brother and I own the company. We have union drivers (teamsters). We terminated a guy for gross negligence ($60-90k in damage to truck and customer's property). He filed a grievance and we met yesterday. Is there any way for us to recoup loss? What if I have to hire this person back? Can I still sue the former employee? He also had a workers' compensation injury from the accident. He was fully released and he was working. I had to send him home for failing to work within his restrictions. He called in sick the day after the accident. The carrier recommended termination once he was released. The decision to terminate was completely based on the investigation. They are saying there was a mechanical failure.

According to our job abandonment policy, he now has exceeded the number of days he can go without notifying his absence and will be let go due to this policy. However, we have been trying to contact him for the past three business days to deliver his ending pay check but the employee is unresponsive, could we mail the check? What is the protocol? I know there are laws to providing last pay and we want to be compliant as much as possible.	
3	Regarding COBRA qualifying event notification. There was a clerical error. Terminated employee did not receive notice for 5-6 months. In that time the terminated employee purchased their own insurance and is now angry because they could have continued through COBRA.	
3	We terminated an employee back in July. We received an unemployment notice of claim files in August and I responded. I just received another unemployment notice of claim filed. Can you give me an idea as to why I would receive another one?	
0	We had an exempt employee and she worked over two holiday days and we were unaware of this. She brought it to our attention after the fact and ask for time off in lieu of pay. She was terminated shortly after and is requesting pay for those two days. She got paid for the holidays and we don't have a practice of providing comp time to exempt employees. We offered severance as part of the termination and we were going to pay for unused vacation and those two days. We normally have a policy that if you are terminated for cause you don't receive payout for unused vacation. However, she didn't sign the severance agreement. Do we owe her the holidays?	
1	Good afternoon: We are located in the State of Minnesota and a former employee has requested a truthful statement of termination. She has done so within the 15 working day time frame but I'd like your insight on wording. I know it can be very brief (one or two sentences). The circumstance was that we hired an individual to oversee an entire department (Integrated Production Department). The former employee was in the know that we were looking for somebody with a broader skill to manage the group. Once we hired the person, we made the decision to eliminate the position of the individual who had the narrower skill set (the one now making the request). What thoughts do you have for me on what the 'truthful statement of termination should be? Her last day was August 31st. I really appreciate your help on this! Steve

I received information that stated Virginia employment at-will unless there is a contract. Can you explain that? We do not require notice. We have an at-will handbook. Can you interpret the legalese in Comply. If there is an end date in the contract does that destroy at-will. It states it will be renewed every year (the contract) and sends the job will not exceed 3 years and 9 months.

Can we ask him to sign a voluntary resignation? By the end of the week we want to the guy terminated. We have documentation of him being insubordinate. He was trying to manipulate a document that we have to give to the SEC; he was putting the company at risk and against my will he submitted a document to the compliance group against what I had directed.

Upon a further investigation, we have discovered other performance issues in addition to the personality conflicts etc. We would like to pay her our severance, but part of that agreement is that she work with a board member to transition her duties. Is this legal. Also, she owes the company about $1,700 in an outstanding loans, but if we take that out of her check, it will bring it to minimum wage.

1	Hi, we have an employee who will be leaving the company at the end of this month. We normally have employees sign a separation agreement which includes the protection of confidential company information. In her particular case, as she is a manager and privy to company financials, we would like her to agree not to solicit our clients especially as she is going to a competitor. My research indicates that non solicitation agreements are a violation of public policy in the state of California and the only exceptions are when nonsolicitation clauses may be upheld where the agreement is necessary to protect trade secrets. My questions are: 1.) am I correct that we cannot enforce non-solicitation agreement? 2.) what is considered trade secrets? Thank you.

4	We are going to terminate an employee today who works as customer service in our North Carolina location. She was hired in mid March, and has been absent for a variety of reasons 8 days out of 30. Including because her grandmother was in the hospital and because she had a warrant out for her arrest and had to spend several hours in jail. Her manager had disciplined her for poor work performance and the employee claimed harassment. When I asked what she meant, she said the manager was being "nit-picky" and making her uncomfortable. Upon our investigation, no harassment occurred. We wrote the manager up for being too close to the employee's personal space because the manager went to her work station seeking the work that was to have been completed and that is what made the EE uncomfortable. The final result was yesterday when the employee was on a 50 min ph call with a patient discussing her personal business and making claims of how she wants to "kill her boyfriend." Our ph calls are recorded and I was able to hear that tape. For that reason, we are terminating her today. Please advise.	
4	When someone is terminated we have 5 days to provide them with their final check correct? She put in 2 weeks notice and we told her that she could leave the date that she put her notice in.	
1	We're looking to downsize our office. We have put in new systems so we need to eliminate 2 positions however, those positions are held by 2 of our most senior and oldest employees. One is 80 yrs old. We're concerned about potential age discrimination and would like to inquire about retirement. We don't need those positions anymore and she's resistant o learning and can't seem to learn the software. Can we ask about their plans to retire?	
5	We have an employee who left and has not returned our keys and has left some of his miscellaneous tools behind. We have tried to call but he does not return or answer. We would to send a certified letter asking that he return the key and company tools and that upon return of those items we will return his tools to him. What really are our options and obligations with regard to getting back our property and return his property to him. This is our Reading, PA location.	
2	Does ThinkHR have any samples of reduction of force letters?	
3	For CA employees, if they terminate do we have to provide them with their check on their last day worked? What if they provide notice?	
3	Hi, I am the HR person at Neato Robotics - thus would like a separate HR opinion so I"m not biased. I am currently a part time employee, Neato needed/needs Full Time HR assistance. The position of the full time opportunity was offered to me, however I declined due to personal reasons. We have found a replacement HR representative who is beginning May 8th. She will be full time as the company needs. We do NOT have a need for 1.5 HR people so my position is expiring. There will be a brief overlap of a week or 2 max to hand-off/transition the role. My question is: what is the reason for my exit? Is my position being eliminated? Did I resign (since I said no the FT opportunity)? , Is it a voluntary resignation, involuntary resignation? Is it a mutual separation? part of the reason I'm inquiring is I want to be sure I have record of someone other than myself determining the reason, as well as determining my eligibility for filing unemployment. Thank you.	
5	Following up on the previous issue where we terminated the employee, the employee was notified on Sunday and told him to go home. Then, the manager was out on Monday. On Tuesday, the manager told me of the termination. The employee wasn't able to get into the office till tomorrow. THR advisor told us to pay through Wednesday because that is when we could get him a check. He called back today demanding to speak with the board of directors. When we told him that wasn't going to happen, he demanded we pay him through the rest of the week because that is what he was scheduled to work. He has not made any threats of physical harm, but he only lives a few blocks away.	
1	When employee decides to resign and gives us 2 weeks notice, can we just let the employee go on that day? Or do we have to keep the employee till the last day the employee set? If we let the employee go before the set day, will that be considered as termination? Are there any risk?	
2	termination form	
4	Follow up to previous issue regarding terminating an employee. She has not worked in 2 weeks and she has already been paid through her last day worked. We owe her no additional wages. She has no accrued vacation or PTO available. Just want to confirm that we owe her no additional earnings. She is enrolled in our health benefits. We have less than 20 employees. How should we manage her health benefits? Can I email her the termination notice? I did receive the NY State Record of Employment Notice from Just Works and will include that in my correspondence.	
3	We did a RIF in November to include an Exhibit A in our agreements. If there is an additional person being laid off, how long after the initial Exhibit A do additional laid offs need to be included in the Exhibit A?	
1	We've had some new management come in and we are looking at our sales team to see who are good performers and who are poor performers. We need to let some go. We previously did not have a lot of accountability so some of these people have been here for years and were never spoken to about their performance. There was never really a consistent way we've held people accountable for performance in the past.	
1	Employees who are on a visa or H1b - what types of things are we responsible for if we decide to let them go? We don't have enough work and may need to lay off some of our developers. We are choosing those to lay off based on performance. What obligations do we have to them because of the H1b?	
6	According to Texas Payday Law - we cannot withhold a final paycheck (employee was terminated for this incident) to pay for the insurance deductible or damages to a vehicle that a delivery driver (our employee) caused, can we? Doesn't he have to sign a written consent and it also cannot drop his check below minimum wage as well? Am I correct in this assumption?	
2	regarding proper language for termination letter.	
5	We have an employee who has worked for us for two months. We have coached him on a daily basis regarding our processes and procedures, but it appears he is not able to catch on. As of late, he has also been making very inappropriate comments to our customers and doctors. What do we need to tell him is the reason for termination? Should we address the comments?	
5	We had an independent contractor come in today with an invoice for payment. He demanded payment and when we did not pay him immediately he stormed out. We want to severe his agreement.	
1	Kimberly Kellermann called in. She will request to be added as a registered user through the broker. Please cc kimberly@osconnects.com We are looking to terminate an employee who works remotely in MI. Our company is located in MO. This is a territory outside sales representative who has had multiple performance discussions, he is still not improving. Its time to let him go. We want to talk about risk factors and anything we should be aware of.	
5	An employee is voluntarily terminating today. He decided he wanted to take a P&P course which is very expensive and he needed the money up from. If they want to leave during the first year they owe us pay in increments (based on the passage of time). Can we take the money out of final pay? He was upset he has to pay that back.	
2	Confidential question.	
1	We had to create an ADEA notice. How soon do we need to give that to people?	
4	An employee at one of our locations was paid a live check and a direct deposit accidentally. She said she didn't get it at first but then came clean. She hasn't been back to work because she has a sick child. We were going to fire her anyways. She expects to get paid with this next check but ADP is taking out what little she can from the next one. It was over $1k and when the direct deposit hit she was negative so ADP couldn't reverse it. We want to tell her not to even come back. We don't trust her at all! Please let us know what we can do.	
2	Beth, Can you tell me if we just laid this individual off with no intention of bringing him back do you see an issue? Once laid off we would start actively looking to fill the position. Thanks, Eric P Unger VP Vision Mechanical Inc. 135 Juniata Street West Reading Pa. 19611 Office: 610-376-6700 Fax: 610-376-6300 ericunger@visionmechanical.com	
6	Q3- When people come in on resignation to collect final pay and returning final time sheet. 10-20 mins, should we pay them for that time? for exempt and non- exempt. If for whatever reason they did not complete final paperwork.	
5	We had an employee who worked at our mechanic shop and had a number of issues with our foreman. He has been written up a couple times and he contested the write ups. We moved him to another site and he has been saying negative things about other employees, he sprayed the water truck at other employees. Can we still terminate him if he contested the write ups?	
1	I'm looking for what we legally have to give someone after they are terminated or no longer working for us? Anything relating to employment. What do we need to give them? We have employee asking for termination papers.	
4	What words should I use for termination? We have an Executive who informed us of her plan to retire at the end of the year. We spent 2 months to find people to replace her. She approved a company announcement regarding her retirement and the replacements, agreed to train them, and work on special projects in the meantime. She has become a problem in that she is meddling in the old role, gossiping and undermining her replacement. We have spoken to her about this in the past. She told the direct reports that the new person was not going to make it. We are done and want to give her an opportunity to resign.	
3	Is there is a difference between laying off and firing in terms of our unemployment insurance?	
1	One of our employee gave two weeks notice and we let him go before the two weeks were up. Are we required to compensate him for the full two weeks?	
6	If an employee resigns without any prior notice do you have to mail their final check or can you require them to pick it up from your office?	
5	have a group that has an employee that did not show up for work. Did not call, The Employer reach out to the employee, and he gave them a story that he was going to be late. Next step, this employees mother calls the Employer saying he has checked himself into a rehab for drug abuse. The employer wants to terminate this employee back to the date he didn't show up for work. they have an employee handbook with language that states if they do not report on scheduled work days and do not have permission from a supervisor to be excused, it is grounds for immediate termination. Are they ok to terminate this employee back to the date he didn't show up on his scheduled time ?	
5	I have a manager that wants to know, can an employee quit in lieu of termination? Can he give them the option? (things have changed) Employee left truck in a certain spot one evening and left the gas credit card in a secure location, when she came back the next day the truck was backed in and had obviously been in an accident. She asked around and another employee pulled the credit card out from his wallet. This is the employee that we want to terminate as we feel that he may have taken the truck.	
4	Im hoping you can help me out. 1.We had an employee who resigned. We asked her to leave prior to the end of her notice period (it was a long notice period and she worked with money). She is being awarded unemployment due to the fact that we asked her to leave prior to the end of her notice period because we didnt have anything in our policy regarding notice periods. Is there common wording that we can add to our policy to cover this? Wed like the option to choose whether they work their full notice period or not if possible. On page 6 of our handbook is the closest information to covering this loophole but its not effective. 1.Is there any way to have our employee handbook reviewed to see if weve covered everything appropriately? I googled the FMLA wording and added what I found but I would feel much better having a professional review everything.	
3	We have a client that had an employee give notice, it was a long notice period. Because she handled money they let the employee go before the end of their resignation period and they employee receive unemployment. Is there a policy which will help avoid this? The employer is based in North Carolina.	
5	We have an employee who was hired two weeks ago and he was arrested at our company last Friday. Since then he has not shown up but he has not reported in. His wife said she'd give us an update but we haven't heard anything. This morning I notice that the county jail tried to contact me last night and I assume it was him. Can we move forward with termination based on job abandonment?	
6	I wanted to have guidance on providing final pay details. Most of our employees are tips and its hard for us to calculate our tips in advance. Is it legal for us to calculate their final tips the following day (credit cards)? We also have a tip jar pool. If we type up an agreement to pay calculable the next day, that would be reasonable?	
1	We have been using severance agreements based on the templates you have provided, that our legal counsel has also reviewed. We have had a few instances where an outgoing employee will redline the agreement, or disagree with some of the working. What is the employer's obligation at that point? Do we have to accept their changes and notes?

5	Just enrolled in service. Question regarding termination: Termination is in New York. We have an a new employee (1month) who has overstepped his boundaries on several occassions. He has made a client feel uncomfortable. He told the client he learned all about him by checking out all his social media accounts. The client was not happy. In addition, there have been other performance issues. We want to move forward with a termination. What are your thoughts?	
3	We have a client that would like to terminate an employee that is within her 90 day period. They would like to offer her a severance agreement. How should they do this?	
6	I need to draft a job abandonment letter for an employee. How long do I have to provide the final check?	
3	Our client brought on a new hire who terminated employment two days later. They offer benefits effective date of hire and have enrolled him into their plans. His coverage will terminate at the end of the month. Can they deduct the employee contributions for the entire month from his paycheck? If they determine his paycheck won't cover his contributions, what are their options? HR would like to not enroll him but we believe they need to since their plan is set up for DOH eff date. Correct?	
3	This group has semi monthly payroll. However the medical carrier bills on a monthly basis and does not prorate. Also if something terms on Sept 10, there coverage remains until last date of month - Cobra to be offered first of month following. If an employee terms on September 10th, can they deduct off final check the entire monthly contribution to the health plan?

4	question Hi, We have a group that has an employee on LOA and is receiving LTD and CASDI. Here are the details: Her medical, dental and vision benefits were terminated 3/1/17 after she was unable to return to work from FMLA that started 8/17/16. A letter dated 2/22/17 that she placed Karen on a non-FMLA medical leave effective 11/17/16. The letter also stated that since her FMLA/CFRA leave had expired, she would need to continue her benefits under COBRA. She is 68 years old. The group does not expect that she will be returning to work and would like to terminate her. Is there any exposure to the employer if they terminate her? Employee will still receive her LTD benefit and will be given the right to convert her group Life Insurance. *Thank you,* *Cathy deRecat* *Account Manager* *CA License #0B36112* *[image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.wisestamp.com/abd39c91fd88f1c70d07698812508f6b/1332867040.png]* *2235 Challenger Way, #109* *Santa Rosa, CA 95407* Main - 707-778-8181 X105 Direct - 707-673-5759 Fax - 707-778-8181 cathy@hoverhessel.com hoverhessel.com Click here to send me files securely. *Notice of Confidentiality**:* This e-mail, and any attachments, is intended only for use by the addressee(s) and may contain privileged or confidential information.

4	I spoke earlier with another advisor about an employee who had called in a couple of times, when I called her to discuss the use of paid sick time she become abusive and belligerent toward her employer. We were going to write her up for insubordination. I have since found out that she later called two of our employee's and claims to have cursed me our and is threatening to beat the crap out of the manager at the store where she works. We would like to terminate her or suggest she transfer to another store in the hopes that she resign. Can we do either of these?

4	Follow up on Sept 14 issue: The Director of Finance was terminated by her boss, the Executive Director on Friday. We gave her a severance agreement for 2 weeks pay. (she is under age 40). She came back over the weekend and asked to renegotiate for 6 months severance including health insurance coverage, She said this is because we treated her predecessor with that same arrangement. She has been with us for 6 years. Our reason for termination was due to interpersonal relationshp between her and her ED, and a decrease in the quality of her work. We felt she was misusing the company credit card, but have not yet been able to prove. How does the "at will" relationship play in to all this and could we be at risk of getting sued for anything?	
1	I want to check what I need to do before I terminate this employee for not providing certification for the three weeks. Am I supposed to give him something in writing about this?	
4	From a client: I need some help and guidance on terming this employee. Her start date was 6/26/17 and we are within our 90-day probationary period. Out of the time she has been here she hasnt produce quality work in a timely matter, Sent out 4 disbursement to our client tell that was very clear, and she has made it clear that she doesnt want to do what she was hired for. She has also been constantly late and I have gone over this with her saying it inexcusable. I have attached for you to see her Job description and offer letter for you to review. Management would like to term her asap and to have it as a separation it just not working out. We are willing to offer 2 weeks severance which is generous.

4	It's about someone giving verbal notice of resignation then when are asked to give the formal letter they changed their mind. They got out of mandatory training that was a one time thing. We want to say you verbally resigned and we accept the verbal resignation. Can we do that? Employee has had performance issues, we were about to write her up and she mentioned to her supervisor she was going to resign and the supervisor decided not to write her up. The next day was a mandatory training. She contacted the trainer Friday and stated she would not be attending training due to her impending resignation. She came in today and changed her mind. Should they go through the process now for write up or accept the resignation? Is it better if there has been in writing before they try to rescind the resignation?	
5	We have an employee that is in jail and we would like to terminate him because he has been convicted and he will be serving a minimum of a year. We had not heard from him and finally contacted his wife. She stated that he was innocent and we used google and through lawyers found that he was being transferred to a federal prison. This person has missed two shifts. He works in sales so he does not have to come into an office. How should we proceed?	
0	is it legal in IA and NE to hold accrual of PTO for 90 days and if the employee is still employed back credit their vacation accrual?

0	(With Liz): We need guidance on a final paycheck for TX employee and draw on commission and the only amount due is accrued vacation. He owes us $9000 in commission draws. We want to know what we can do about that? We offered a non-forgiveable draw and we would take the draw from the earned commission and we have a maximum of $9000. On this last paycheck, it took $600 to get him up to $9000. He terminated with no notice and he was already paid. We owe accrued vacation. Can we recover any of that draw against the owed vacation? Our policy requires payout of final wages upon termination. We have a draw addendum. We pay out trailing commissions if a loan terminates.	
4	An employee is on CFRA leave right now. She notified us in writing that she is resigning and her last day of employment will be Sunday, October 1. Sunday is not a working day, can we back date it to Friday, September 29? She is enrolled in dental and life insurance only. Life would end as of last day of employment, dental will continue through the full month. At the time of her leave, she signed an authorization that we would recoup missed benefit premiums on future paychecks. We will owe her for accrued PTO. May we deduct her arrears and her October premiums from her PTO check? She has a company laptop, we will send her a shipping label to return it, or she can bring it in, since she lives close. Can we shut her laptop down now?

3	We have a previous employee who submitted their resignation via email. In that email, they let us know they would be taking time off due to a death in the family. We okayed this per our bereavement policy and asked who it was They gave two weeks notice and then we didn't hear from them for weeks. There was no response when we inquired as to whether there were back. We tried multiple communications and never heard back. They still have our equipment, etc. We finally heard from them two weeks after that point and they said they would show up next Thursday. Then we tried to reschedule, etc. We have rescheduled several times and they never show up. They have been terminated in the system but how do we get our property back?	
1	An employee was found by a manager looking at pornographic material and behaving in an inappropriate manner with that material in an area of the warehouse where anyone could have seen him. We do have a professional conduct policy that discusses offensive behavior. Just want to confirm that we may use that as reason for termination. We understand that the same manager had verbally warned the employee in the past of similar inappropriate behavior.	
4	We have an employee who on an informal PIP. The employee was having trouble and I suggested we put her on a PIP but the manager disagreed and wants to remove a couple of task and have her focus on a few key tasks. The employee is not performing and the manager wants to terminate her. We do not have any formal disciplinary notices or a PIP. What are the risks if we terminate?

5	One of our cooks has a lot of performance-based write-ups. He had to leave early due to a tooth ache so another employee had to cover. When the employee went to prep the food, all he found was rotted produce. Maintaining fresh produce is the cook's responsibility. He was here for about 4 hours before saying he needed to go home so he could have done something about this. Do you think there would be much risk if we terminated with this being the last straw? Could he say the reason he didn't manage this was because he didn't feel well?	
5	Difference between lay off and termination. We have a 28 yr old employee who we want to let go after 2 yrs of employment because he is just not getting his work done.

6	An employee's last day she reported to work was January 11. We are terminating her for no call no show. Should her final check be Direct Deposit or live check?	
2	We have an employee who has given his two week notice. His manager wants to release him tomorrow and not honor his notice. Can you we do that?? Please advise. Thank you Irma Ochoa	
3	Our company terminated employees with a severance agreement to keep employees on payroll for a specified amount of time versus a one-time payment and also pay for COBRA. The terminated employee would still be responsible for paying their portion. Are we allowed to deduct the employees responsibility for COBRA and any other voluntary deduction currently on their payroll through these severance payments? Thanks.	
6	I want to verify: Final paycheck in the state of Pennsylvania. They were terminated the date before the payday. When do we need to provide their final check?	
3	There is a possible scenario coming up with an associate. They are looking at a termination where they want to term the associate, give them a 6 month salary continuance, but term the benefits as of the actual term date and offer COBRA on that date. Im just checking to make sure this is something we can do? We havent had this actual scenario before. But instead of paying it out all at once, they want to do it over 6 months. We will have to keep the associate active in the system to keep them in the payroll run for that time period. Is this ok?	
0	I have a question about a pay date of the last paycheck for a departing employee. We have an employee in VA whose last day with us 2/3/2017. We process payroll bi-weekly and there are two pay dates in Feb - 2/3 & 2/17. A pay period for 2/3 is 1/16-1/29 and 2/17 for 1/30-2/12. Could we pay his last paycheck for his work 1/30-2/3 on 2/17 along with his accrued but unused vacation? Or, should it be paid on 2/3? Thank you	
5	The employee I last called about admitted to being hungover and taking xanax before coming to work. He also admitted to getting drugs delivered at work and distributing drugs to other employees as well. Can we terminate him?	
2	We are looking for information regarding a separation agreement for a termination we are conducting.	
3	Guidance regarding employee. Employer went to employee's computer for data and found another employer's response to her application for employment. Employer wants to sit with the employee and discuss what the employer found and ask her if she is looking for another job. The employer is considering either to ask her if she still wants to work for the employer or let the employee go. Also policy states that employees should have no expectation of privacy and are prohibited from using computers for personal use.	
1	Are there restrictions on how far we can offer employment to employees we are laying off? We are closing a location but we have other positions open farther away. Do the employees have to take the relocation?	
1	We are terminating an employee who has been with us for 30 years for bad performance. We are offering a severance package. If we give it as a lump sum, how long do we have to offer health benefits? Just Cobra? And how do we get a release of liability- can we make our own or is there a template?	
1	I have two dispatchers. I told them we would be terminating them at the end of the month. They now gave us doctors notes saying they need to go out on leave for 9 months. What do we have to do?	
4	We have an employee who is in VA, her last paycheck is going to be 2/1. She worked 24 hours and 8 hours of holiday. Our policy states that if her PTO is in negative, then she would owe that back to the company. Can we make the deduction from her pay? It might not leave her with much earnings or any at all. What are the rules around this?	
6	we laid someone off in Nov and said we would pay through 1/31. we need to have a final exit interview with the person and get keys back. they aren't responding to email/. text/phone messages. can we withhold the final paycheck until the meeting is completed?

3	One of our clients is asking the following. Can you please advise? We have a letter that we give to employees on their last day explaining the terms of the employment ending including severance, leave being paid out to them, etc. I would like to require their signature in order for them to receive their last paycheck. Is it legal to hold onto their check until they sign? Theyre only signing that they have received the letter.	
1	Hi, our company would like to shut down a department in the US as we have coverage in a foreign country. The company will give a severance package to the employees that will be layoff. Is there any concerns we should have?	
5	Please call. 415-488-8180 or cell: 415-763-9000 I have an administrative hearing regarding an employee's final wages which were issued late but some of the claims he's made, dates used for example, are incorrect. He gave 2 days notice of resignation due to a knee injury incurred previously. We offered to give him leave but he insisted on resigning. He said the surgeon didn't know when the surgery would be done and he didn't want leave. We accepted his resignation with 2 days notice. I asked him how he wanted to handle his final paycheck. He said he could wait until the following payday so we agreed on that and his manager was a witness to this. My question is regarding the penalty fees.	
5	We have an employee who we recently let go. I need clarity on a question he is asking. He first came on board Oct. 24, 2011. He started as part time and then we transitioned him to full time in 2012. We provided a severance package as of his full-time date of hire. Mostly because we do not provide benefits to part-time employees. He wants to ensure he is eligible for unemployment benefits.	
6	Small office in VA, involuntary term - timing of last check?	
1	We were planning to terminate an employee on Friday and that person called in sick, called in sick on Monday, and called in sick again today. Should we call that person n today to complete the termination?	
3	Former employee who is filing a lawsuit against the organization regarding late wages. What is the requirement in CA?	
4	Good afternoon! We have an employee that was hired on 03/04/16. She requested an extended period of personal time off (six weeks) & we made an exception (to our maximum of two weeks off at any given time policy) & approved the request. She is supposed to return to work tomorrow - but in her absence, it has become blaringly apparent that she creates what could be considered a hostile work environment in her department & didn't perform all duties requested. We were thinking of terminating her appt. upon her arrival & paying her the four hours of show up. I wanted to reach out to see if you had any feedback, & look forward to hearing back as soon as possible.

1	The issue is we have an EE that would like to relinquish their duties and drop to a lower position. We want to know if we have a right to let that person go because we don't have another position available. If so, what steps do we need to take for termination?	
4	We have an employee who filed a claim of sexual harassment (quid pro quo) whereby she felt her boss had some control over her progression within the company. We investigated and could not support her claim. We put the entire company through sexual harassment training. Six months later, this manager came to me complaining about the employee making sexual advances at him: touching him, talking about his skin, his skin tone, tattoos, etc. The manager has asked her to stop. We counseled her but her actions can continue. Can we terminate?	
5	Employee did not show up to work today and his brother notified us that he was arrested. We are wondering if we could terminate because he has been arrested? I thought I saw that a company cannot terminate based on arrest.	
5	We have an employee in ND who will be laid off. He is aware. Can we withhold his final paycheck or his vacation pay until he returns the company laptop? He has company files that he has been working on. How can we obtain those company (electronic) files?	
3	If an employee has exausted all FMLA time, continues to call off with doctor's excuses (many of which are unrelated to the reason for taking the FMLA), and is already on a last chance agreement for attendance issues, is it safe for the employer to terminate?	
1	Hi ThinkHR! We are planning on eliminating a single position from our company that is no longer needed. This will just impact one employee, but I was wondering if we would classify this as a layoff or a termination. Any information on how to classify (layoff vs. termination) would be helpful. I'm happy to provide more context, but this individual doesn't have enough projects and is only working about 15 hours a week, although he is a full-time, salaried employee. Performance hasn't been an issue, there just isn't enough to do for him and what he is working on can be absorbed by others within the company. As such, we don't need the position and we would like to terminate employment, and we don't plan on backfilling this role at any point in the forseeable future, and any future hires on this team would be much more junior. Thanks!	
5	We have an employee at an Oklahoma site that has been off work for 8 weeks due to a health issue not associated with work. His doctor will not release him to come back to work under any conditions. The employee has told his supervisor that he doesn't think he will ever be able to come back to work. We would like to terminate him and allow him to apply for unemployment. Are we within our rights to do so? How would you advise us to proceed?

2	Client: K. Meritt Agencies We are looking for a template termination letter for performance. Can you send any other termination paperwork for an employee in New York? karenmerritt@allstate.com	
4	We hired a salaried, exempt manager and she worked one day, then quit saying she wasn't ready for the stress. Can we prorate her weekly pay and only pay her for one day, or are we required to pay her for a full week. Thank you.	
5	We have an employee who gave his resignation. But his final day is on October 13th. Because of this he will be receiving all the paid holidays. Can we terminate his employment before then?	
4	Contact# 623-932-9800 Re: Needs to discuss steps to take when someone quits their job. Employee sent a text on Monday stating that she was not return to work. She did give her verbal notice stating that she got another job. Last week she was searching something on the computer and I approached her about it to ask her if it was work related. She seemed a little defensive. On Friday she texted that she would not be going to work because her kids were sick. Then on Monday she texted that she was putting in her notice because she felt disrespected and today on Tuesday she did not show up to work. She has had attendance and other performance issues in the past that all have been documented. Would this be sufficient enough to terminate her?

3	What if an employee isn't working out and given a choice of a PIP or voluntary severance. Would they be eligible for unemployment if they accepted the PIP and didn't pass?	
5	Fwd: Exempt Pay Question Hi, We have an exempt manager that was recently hired. Several employees told us he was sending inappropriate snap chat conversations so the Area Coach met with the manager on Friday and told him we would be conducting an investigation and we didn't want him working his shift on Friday. Although we were not able to get the specific "chats" off snap chat, we are confident inappropriate messages were being sent to employees (including a minor) so we termed him yesterday morning. I know we only have to pay for hours worked the first and last week an exempt employee works, but wanted to verify to what extent we can do that. Here are the hours he did work: Wed: 10 1/4 Thur: .63 Fri - 4 1/4 (this is the day we sent him home. He was scheduled for 10 hours) Sat - 0 (was scheduled for 10 hours) Sun - 1 (term meeting lasted less than an hour. Was scheduled for 10 hours) Thanks, Cindy -- Cindy Adams Human Resources Manager Hospitality Restaurant Group 315/451-1957 phone 315/451-9603 fax	
5	I have an employee who is out today. I don't think he called in but rumor has it he was arrested for outstanding parking tickets. Is there any legal requirements to hold a person's job in this case?	
3	We have a client who has had an employee pass away. The employer is looking for information regarding what they can do to provide assistance to the employee's spouse. We discussed COBRA , and how the employer can choose to pay for the continuation. Another question that has come up is if the employer can continue to pay wages for the deceased employee as a way to assist the spouse? How would the final paycheck need to be handled?	
3	Alex Webb, Controller - An employee is going to be terminated tomorrow for cause. Today, the employee approached me and asked point blank: "Am I getting fired tomorrow?" I responded, I do not know. How should I handle this for the remainder of today and tomorrow? I really do not want to say anything to anyone about this as only the direct manager and myself know of the termination.	
3	Two employees are resigning this Friday, Sept 22. Our next regular payday is that Monday, Sept 25. Must they receive their check, including vacation on that Monday?	
4	Employment was terminated today. For the past couple of years we've had them on FMLA a couple of times. As she was going out the door, she said she was going sue us because she was fired for being out sick. We did write her up for absences 8/2016 - 5 months. But on 3/22/17 she was written up due to an outburst that customer overheard, given 12 months to refrain from outbursts or she would be terminated. Today she did it again, so we terminated her. She was told she was being terminated for unprofessional conduct.	
3	Question from Client Bishop International: Have a brand new employee hired 2 weeks ago. The employee was drug tested and had a negative drug test.

0	We pay our sales staff an hourly rate plus commission - $11.54 per hour. Texas employee resigned and our policy is to pay accrued vacation upon termination. Would we use a blended rate or pay it based on his hourly rate? What about overtime in TX? Is it calculated on the hourly rate or do we have to consider commission like we do for California employees?	
6	We will be terminating an employee for taking time off without requesting it or getting approval for it. I have a question about his final paycheck. In the past, when he'd submit incorrect information such as mileage, we'd correct the mileage after Googling it, and take the correction from his next paycheck. Can we do that with his final paycheck? He's reported traveling more miles than is required for mileage reimbursement.

0	When employees quit who have used more than their accrued vacation time Can we deduct the negative vacation pay from their final check? The employee works in the state of MA.	
1	Could it be considered discrimination to terminate an employee based on a language barrier? At the time of hire it was not an issue, but due to a recent reorganization of the team and duties, much more client interaction is required. We are experiencing both internal and external parties not wanting to work with this employee based on the ability to communicate. Are there any items we should consider when determining our option to terminate employment?	
6	Additional question - we terminated the employee and sent him home at 6 am, advising he can return later in the day for his final paycheck. we have then added 4 hours pay for the reporting time this morning to the final check. Is this acceptable?	
4	Employee situation she has been here since 3/31/17 and has Issues with excessive absenteeism and tardiness. We gave her a written warning on 9/8 for calling out 4 Sunday's in a row. She was supposed to work this weekend but called out saying she was in a car accident and can't work. She hasn't seen a doctor and doesnt have a doctor. What can we do?	
4	Confirm - FT employee in corporate office was given a performance review by her manager on 9/6, it was mentioned that if she were to stay she would be put on a PIP. Before the manager could explain the PIP she said "I'm thinking of leaving". Manager gave her a week to think about it. On the 14th she tells the manager she has decided to leave. We began to negotiate a termination date. The manager and I agree to 10/27. She came back to manager saying "what if I don't get a job, can I go on the PIP" ? The manager is afraid if we give her severance she will feel that she was terminated.	
3	We have a client that has eliminated a position and they are negotiating with the employee regarding a severance package. The employee is wanting medical coverage for a year, should this be part of a written agreement?	
4	Via vmail. 714-442-1212 Employee is continuing to miss work and it is time to terminate her. Is there any additional consideration since she is in Oregon? She stated the power was out but she was not in the affected area?	
4	We have a female employee who is claiming that she is being treated differently by her foreman because she is a woman. She was written up last week for taking the company vehicle to a local gas station so that she and another female employee could use the restroom, then they drove to the office to get their paychecks. As they did not have permission to drive to the office she was written up. Additionally she was told she could no longer drive the company vehicle because she is not on the insurance. We already have a foreman and lead tech who is on the insurance for the crew, plus it came to my attention last week that this employee had bragged to another female employee that she and her husband had stolen from another landscaping company and we do not want her driving our truck. She has assumed that we will not let her drive because she is a woman. She was told we would not let her drive because she's not yet on the insurance. When I spoke to the foreman about how she is being treated he says she acts in a sexual manner and uses her woman to her way. She will raise her shirt to wipe sweat off her face and this exposes her mid section and sometimes you can see her sports bra. Last week she had to step over a male co-worker in the back of a crowded van. This was done in a lascivious manner. Another co-worker was interviewed via phone and he is claiming that she grabbed him down there (the testicles) and that she asked him another time if his "ball sack was sticking to his leg" because of the heat. Can we terminate the employee?	
3	There is an employee that we want to term they were monitoring the CEO's email account and who responded to another employee using the CEO's email account and then they deleted the email once the employee replied back. The IT person was able to track the email. They stated they were monitoring the CEO's email to the CEO. The flip side of this is that, that employee is may boss the CFO.	
5	An employee was working for us through a staffing firm, and that staffing firm suddenly closed as of Monday. We immediately put the employee on our payroll and gave him all of the new hire paperwork. While we were discussing his rate of pay, he stated that he would not work for that low rate and if that is all we are going to pay him, he would not give 100%. The foreman does not want to keep him employed because of the employee's sudden poor attitude and statement of not willing to give 100%. May they terminate his employment? He is within his first 3 days of employment as our employee, and has not yet provided the documents to back up his form I-9. What if we terminate him today and he has not presented us with those documents?	
4	Follow up to Sept 18 issue: The employee gave her 2 week resignation because she said she found another job. She then learned that the other job offer was rescinded, so she said that she does not want to resign. Must we bring her back?	
1	We are offering a severance package to person and wondered if we should take out 403b contributions?	
4	Hi, I would like to seek advice on how to handle an employee we recently terminated. Our employees are remote but within the Dallas/Fort Worth area. We had an employee that was a no call no show for a week and a half leaving our reports backlogged. We did reach out to her via email but did not get a reply as to when she would be returning. Due to the no call no show we terminated her and sent her a certified mail for notification of end of employment and we did not get confirmation that she received the notice. However, she did try to start logging in and contacting our supervisor about 2 days after we had sent out that notice. She has continuously tried to contact other employees and our direct supervisor asking why she is locked out of the system. We would like to know how to handle this issue. Would sending her another notice via certified mail need to be done or should we schedule a call with her?	
4	with Courtney on the line. We are struggling with one of our Teachers. We found out though hearsay, that she has fetal alcohol syndrome. She has trouble with memory, poor judgement, issues with parents and coworker social reactions. We have moved her 5 times as she has been given substitute positions. The last position was a full time assignment she was given to her last month. We would like to pull her 90 day not a fit card. We have given her a verbal warning. We are considering a written warning. We don't have a specific incident. We want to let her go. Parent are complaining when they sign out on roll sheet, she looks at it immediately. They wonder if she trusts them.	
1	We have a sales employee who terminated with a draw against commission in the amount of $9,000. There are no commissions for his final pay to offset the draw. We pay trailing commission for 90 day, so if he makes a commission in those 90 days we will use that to pay back the draw. If there is a balance after 90 days, can we try to collect from the employee? We are in CA and the employee is in TX. Our draw addendum to his contract does not address paying back the draw upon termination	
4	We have an associate voluntarily quit after she physically assaulted another employee. She verbally told me she quit but she did not sign the exit paperwork. Is this still a resignation?

5	An employee had been hospitalized in early August and notified his boss that he may not be able to return to work until December. The company terminated the employee. What are the risks to the company? We have 24 employees. I am not aware as to whether the employee provided a doctor's note or whether his supervisor asked for a doctor's note.	
1	We're planning on terminating 3 employees this week for performance, insubordination and violation of company policies. I would like to discuss some details with you.	
4	Follow up questions about a resignation, Karen is also on the line - Resignation yesterday was accepted. This morning the employee communicated she wants to retract it. The supervisor already started to recruit someone else who was on per diem. In the past, the employee has threatened to quit multiple times. We understand we may have some liability under unemployment. She is in a protected class. If UI office sees it her way, does that open the risk for other lawsuits? She states she did not get an acceptance response on the resignation. Is that going to make a difference? If we are going to deny the retraction, should we pay her through the original resignation date? Must we offer COBRA?	
5	We have a drug free policy. We had a guy in shipping recently want to become a driver and we did the DOT drug test. I just got back his drug test results and it was positive for everything. Last week he had a workers comp injury. He was running to a gate when it closed and he went to the emergency room because he dislocated his arm. Can I terminate him?	
6	We have an employee who has abandoned his position, and did not show up to work for 3 consecutive days. We tried to contact the employee everyday. We sent a letter to the employee informing that per company policy he has voluntarily resigned his position, and that his final paycheck was ready to be picked up at our office. In this situation, do we need to mail his final paycheck to his last known address or do we need a written request for the check to be mailed? In other words, is his place of termination the company's office, or the employee's last known address? thank you,	
5	A salary exempt employee resigned with two week notice which we accepted. The employee informed us that he wants to change his term date to this Friday instead. Supervisor replied with why not today? Can we change his termination date to today?	
6	If I choose to terminate someone right now, can I have their final paycheck to them by tomorrow? It's 24 hours correct?	
4	One of our employees was working on our client job site and made a formal complaint of one of their employees (another female) sexually harassing her. Through the investigation, the complainant was disruptive and talking to others and texting others regarding the status of the case. We placed her on paid admin leave. The harasser was terminated, but we then learned that the complainant was partially to blame because she continued to send sexually provocative pictures and texts to her. We brought the employee back to work, but she is working at our corporate location due to her disruptiveness at the client site. She is performing poorly and refuses to work on the assignments she is assigned. For that reason, we are going to terminate her. I just wanted to run this by someone before we move forward. We are aware that there are risks involved but we feel we have done our due diligence in performing a fair and accurate investigation and have documented all circumstances clearly.	
2	one of the employee stole our blank check and was cashed - Can you create a letter?	
6	Can we delay an employee's final paycheck if they do not return their building badge or keys? It creates a security issue for us when these items are not returned.	
5	It's regarding a termination. We have an employee we hired on June 1st. They have verbally talked to him. He was hired to do repairs and maintenance. They wanted to speak to him Monday, but he called owner on Sunday saying he had a doctor's appointment Monday. He hurt his foot at home. Can not put pressure on his foot. He had a doctor note for 2 weeks, 21st he was supposed to return. Got another note on the 20th saying no weight on foot until Oct 1st . We need to re hire someone. Can we separate him? The concern is things were not going great before the injury at home. Would like to discuss.	
2	Does Washington DC have a separation notice that employers have to file with the Department of Employment Services upon separation/termination of an employee? (i.e. similar to the State of GA DOL 800 form). My company has stores in DC but we are headquartered in GA.	
1	If someone is placed on long term disability and have exhausted all their FMLA, are we able to terminate them?	
5	A recent new hire began (start date 08/30/17) not coming to work over back issues that he says are not work related. He has missed a great deal of work in the first 3 weeks. Is there any liability in terminating him for failing to report for work? The location he works at is located in Menomonie, WI	
3	Our client is a travel agency and stated their business is suffering with all the natural disasters in the Caribbean, which is the source of their business. The owner asked if she could lay herself off and file for unemployment benefits? She has not been taking a check on a regular basis. They are a S corp. I appreciate your advice.	
6	I have an existing employee who we are holding a pay check. The employee is not reaching back or responding back to us. He has been missing -- He has company van, computer, phone, other company items. We reported the lost items. On pay check, how long do we hold his pay check?

2	Change in relationship form - is it for people who resign?	
4	I'd prefer to have a call about our issue, but when I called it said the hotline was closed. If you could, please call me at 781-870-7420. Our Enhancement Production Supervisor, who I actually put a ticket in about with Think HR a couple of weeks ago, has been on light duty since 9/5/17, her manager has reported a bad attitude from her and insubordination since and this week she had unauthorized absences Monday, Wednesday and today, claiming she "has nothing to do", which firstly is untrue, and secondly, does not authorize her to stay home from work on a scheduled work day. I composed a warning record for her yesterday (her manager reiterated to her that she needs to report to work Monday through Friday and that there is plenty of work for her to do), in which she would have been presented with to sign today, but again she did not show up. She was in contact with her manager Monday and Wednesday, to say she would not be in, but was a 'no call, no show' today.	
3	We have a client that reached out and said they have employee that may be giving their 2 week notice. They wanted to know what their options where if any?	
5	We have an employee, driver, who recently had a light stroke. Company never received a fit for full duty status notice from his doctor. He have used all his 12 weeks FMLA. Can this employee be terminated?	
5	We had an employee resign indicating his last day would be on Friday. However the employee has not called or shown up since Monday. This is a salaried exempt employee. We don't have a specific policy regarding PTO, but have a loose practice of unlimited time off because we operate in a start-up environment. We anticipate the employee will come in today or tomorrow to finalize things. Can we not pay him for the days he missed?	
3	After careful consideration, company has decided to terminate an employee upon the return from FMLA due to egregious errors uncovered during absence. Is it appropriate to conduct termination via phone instead of having employee come in just to leave. Particularly, the company wants to be mindful because this employee doesn't drive and uses a walker.	
1	We will be eliminating one of our departments, causing lay offs for some of our employees. What must we do to prepare the employees for the layoffs? We already have spoken to them about it and held a few meetings to explain. We have less than 100 employees.

4	I have an employee that just started a week ago and she is just not cutting it. Is there any way to terminate her? She is in Texas and it is an at will state. She is 45 and she is Hispanic. She is doing a bit of recruiting and it took her all day to copy and paste a resume and she just started. Is there is something that we can write in the offer letter like a 90 day introductory period.. If we let her go there is another person that started and she is not hispanic and she is caucasian. In the interview she aced it.. She just started on 9/11/17.	
4	We have another person and we gave her a severance and gave her 21 days and she was on medical leave. The 21 days have passed and she she is stating that she did not have a chance to do it. Can we still have her sign it? Is it up to the company?	
4	Legality of a Termination. Employees need to be licensed through CA gambling commission. The commissioners found that the employee got a DUI, but she didn't disclose this on her background info. Commissioners questioned her honesty. She has been in country for 4 years. She plead down to a wet and reckless. Said she didn't think it was criminal so she didnt put it on the background check. She didn't think it would keep her from being licensed. So, I took her to the hearing with the commission. While there, a member of DOJ commented that she was arrested on Sunday for domestic violence. This was news to me. She is not being honest with me. They gave her a temporary license and I want to let her go because of her deceit. On the way home from the meeting she told me that she lied to the police on Sunday too.	
5	We have a maintenance department off site and there are 15 guys and the head person hired an individual that does not speak English very well.

Can we do this?

She has given us no verbal or written notice of a condition that relates to this being a known issue. She has mentioned health problems in general but nothing specific.

2	Does ThinkHR have any sample severance policies?	
4	We have an employee we terminated at our main office that says she has personal items at the site she worked at and that she wants those items back. What are the laws around this situation?

We have other incidences of poor performance as well. Our concern is retaliation for her claim and are wondering if a layoff is better.	
5	Driver was dishonest about the time he left our facility and where he went with our truck. We received phone calls from 2 different drivers on I-95 who were both very emotional stating that our employee was driving erratically on the road, going as fast as 90 mph and as slow as 30 mph in a very unsafe manner. He was to go directly to another work site and the GPS is showing us that he went past the location and kept on going. When asked, he said he was trying to pass a truck and the other driver would not let him back in. This does not corroborate with the 2 drivers' stories. We are terminating him for cause (this is his 4th chance as a driver with us, he had been termed in the past for other violations). Can I review my termination letter with you?	
4	We have an employee who's worked for us for 27 years. She is 60 yrs old. Our only concern is that her performance has been decreasing. We brought someone else in to assist her as a laborer.

If we terminate and offer her a severance agreement, do we need to offer severance to all other employees?

We work in a power plant and safety is critical: this employee does not wear the Proper Protective Equipment (PPE), a subcontractor got electrocuted because she did require that the he/she follow the proper lock out tag out procedure; there was a process that she did not follow. We did a written warning and it was strongly written, when we found out she was smoking in the vehicle. More recently she did not follow procedure and smashed into one of the solar panels.

Also, are there other forms we need to provide to them? Please call 4408977639 and please email response to Dianejarm@gmail.com as well.

6	We have an employee who effectively quit today without notice. Our vacation policy states that we will collect any vacation hours used that were not accrued upon termination. This gentleman has not worked any hours during the current pay period. Now that he has resigned, his "final check" next Friday will be a zero dollar check. However, this individual was not enrolled in direct deposit and was still receiving hard checks. His check from the previous pay period is still sitting in the office which will have to be mailed now. Since his "final check" will be a zero check, can we simply reopen the check from the previous pay period and deduct the collections? Is this allowed or advisable? I do not feel that it is allowable, but the office is in a debate about it! Any help would be greatly appreciated!!

After terminating an employee the supervisor has found "unlabeled drugs" amongst the employees belongings and is unsure to throw them in the trash, keep them, ship them, etc. For context, he isnt allowed on company property and the employer doesn't wish to "drop them off" at his house.

1	We have a new hire that has claimed race discrimination and we have been unable to substantiate it. I have done an investigation and have spoken to other people who the employee claimed felt the same way. In the end I believe it is the way people are talking to the new hires. They are very direct and don't always say things nicely. We have had three incidents of thefts and this person is the prime suspect. She was on the floor at that time and had access to resident's personal belongings. We have never had an issue of theft before and now we have three since she's been hired. We have investigated and even talked to her but she has denied. What are our risks if we decide to terminate? Theft.

1	Our boss had a conversation with an employee last week and employee was terminated. We are providing him with his paperwork and severance this week . Is it common to have them come back to the office to fill out final paperwork? The employee is not angry or hostile. What's the best practice on the situation?	
2	I received sample severance agreement templates a few months ago. Can you resend them to me?	
5	We are a very small company with 28 employees at the time. The business is super slow. We are doing a re-org trying to save on costs. One person is scheduled to be let go but is out for two weeks due to health issues. There is no PFML as we are too small to qualify. He didn't ask for unpaid medical leave or anything of that nature. He is simply out sick. He already exhausted all his accrued sick and vacation time. He keeps open communication, informs us of his conditions and still cannot estimate the return time. How should we proceed with his termination? If we terminate during sick leave or right upon his return, what could be potential outcome? Thank you.	
5	Job abandonment. Employee was relieved from work, sick for 4 days. Upon return within a week, emailed manager on Wednesday about wanting time off for Rosh Hashana on Thursday. He didn't show up for work on Friday. Manager took him off assignments on Saturday and Sunday, and reached out to him but did not receive a return call or email. Assignments are put on Case link so it is possible the employee looked there. However, not answering any calls or emails is against the remote worker policy. Our job abandonment policy is 3 days, no call/no show.	
4	We have a new hire who has been with us for two months. She was to be out for week due to her pregnancy. She has not returned to work, and it's been 5 days that she's late in coming back to work. Can we consider to be a no cal no show? We have been attempting to call her and she's not calling back.	
5	We have an employee who has an open WC claim. He has been released to full-duty. He returned to work and then accused another employee of hitting him. We reviewed the video and concluded that this did not happen. We would like to terminate. Is there a problem if he has a open WC claim?	
2	We have an employee who will likely be failing a random drug test. Do you have a sample termination letter?	
3	Can you tell me what kind of provision an employer might be able to put in place to require people to work a specific notice period when they resign? Can we require a notice period or we will not pay out vacation? Is there anything we can do other than just tell them they will not get a good reference from us if they do not give proper notice?	
5	We have an employee, and we are looking to let him go. This summer he had a worker's compensation. that he milked pretty bad. We have been having other issues issues with him talking bad with other employees. We are worried that if we let him go, we may have some backlash from him. I want to talk about how to handle this situation. He had asked for 6 fays off of PTO and he only had 5 days and it was agreed that he would have 5 paid and one unpaid. He then came back and asked for a 7th day and his supervisor denied it. He did not come into work and the supervisor called to tell him he needed to come in. When he came in he told other employees that he was authorized a PTO day and then they made him come in. He signed that he understood that if there was any other violation that it may lead to further disciplinary action up to and including termination. Can we terminate him with minimal liability?	
4	An employee was overpaid a few months ago and we asked her to sign an acknowledgement of our recouping those funds over 3 pay periods. She did not sign the document. We are now going to terminate her due to violation of company policy for cancelling all of her client appointments and not notifying anyone here of that. We have a written policy of calling off, and she did not follow our policy. However, today she provided a dr's note from her Friday call off. May we have her sign the acknowledgement now and then terminate her?	
5	We have an employee who has given his notice, he gave 5 days notice and his last day is Friday January 27. Our vacation calendar begins the first of the new year, his annual vacation time is 2 weeks along with 5 personal days. We wanted to verify compliance as far as what we legally owe him upon his departure? He has to date already used two of the five personal days given him.	
6	Can you review FAQ 2 on http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_waitingtimepenalty.htm. I want to confirm my understanding that even if we sent a final paycheck out late, we will not incur penalties for the period between when the employee received the paycheck and when he decided to deposit it.	
2	The client has asked a follow up question that Im hoping you can answer. She is asking if they can hold back the severance payment(s) if the employee refuses to sign off on the acknowledgement that they were provided with the letter at termination. Please advise thank you! Beth	
3	If we hired someone and its not 30 days from their employment, we evaluate at the first four weeks of employment, and the supervisor provides feedback at this point of what needs to improve. If they dont meet the expectation during that probation period, then their employment is terminated. This was the case and now the employee is requesting a letter stating that we fired her. Shes doing an application for unemployment and food stamps, etc. What if anything do we need to provide?	
4	I have a new employee that has been with us for 90 days, two weeks ago she injured her hip and has been off work since. She has since told us she had two previous hip surgeries. She works in our shipping department and during her interview she was told of the lifting she would be required to do and was asked if you would be able to do this. She said yes. The manager of our shipping department would like to terminate her employment. She does not qualify for FMLA since she has only been her for 90 days. She is not claiming workmans comp. Is there any legal reason that we shouldn't terminate her employment? We are concerned she may say she aggrravated her hip with the lifting in shipping.	
2	Is it best to obtain resignations in written form?	
4	With Heather on phone. We have an employee whose productivity has been reportedly decreasing since last year with no indication of improvement. She moved from a productivity level of 46.6% in 2015 to 39.3% in June-Sept 2016 and 38.6% in Oct-Jan 2017. In addition, she makes her co-workers uncomfortable with her rude statements under her breath and negative behavior toward others. She has been given a final warning and we are planning on terminating her now. May we review our final counseling document with you and discuss termination?	
5	Employee stated that during his time working with the company, he had been illegal in the U.S. and acquired the current position by providing false documentation. Employee is now legal in the U.S. and has legal documents to update his file. H.R.'s response: Immediate termination. Employee returns to plead for his position and states that he was a hard working employee who helped the company in staffing as company hired several employees as per his referral. He states that he understands what he did was wrong but that he did not have a bad intention and did so out of necessity of work; he thought he was doing the "right thing" by providing legal documentation to the company. He states that he spoke with his immigration lawyer who was surprised he was fired from the company and says that many people have also provided false documentation to the company. Is immediate termination the correct response? Is company liable for illegal time worked? Can we rehire? What is the correct protocol?TY

4	Hello, We have a situation that Id like some guidance on: Our receptionist has been feeling stressed about work and life issues. In high emotion on 1/14/17 she said she was packing her desk and quitting. Our General Manager encouraged her to take a week of personal time to decide if she wanted to stay and work things out, or if she really wanted to quit. She did take her personal items with her that day. While she was gone, the Club functioned better than usual, without the emotion and stress that her presence created. We hoped she would decide to quit, but planned to terminate her otherwise. We called her today before she reported for her return shift and she informed us that she did indeed decide to retire. She intended to come in to work out her notice, but we told her that we think it is best to end things immediately and we would pay her for the two weeks in lieu of her coming in. We have not done this before, so I have the following questions: Do we pay her a gross	
1	We are a call center. We have a few employees they are late all of the time and we have gotten into the habit of writing them up all the time. A lot of the times they will bring a doctor's note for them or their child. Can we terminate them?	
5	We have an designer that was on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) in 2014 and they have been with us since 2011. The previous supervisor did a great PIP addressing the areas for improvement. The employee signed it and the manager signed it; but, there is no follow-up as to whether or not the employee improved. Since this time the employee has moved to a new manager; and they are having the same issues and I have asked what he has been documenting. The new supervisor provided a few emails that are not very strong. The supervisor now wants to develop an exit plan for this employee. If we have had PIP in the past do we have to have a PIP again? His previous manager is now a peer and works remotely can I talk to him about the previous PIP? He has earned about a month of PTO and he wants to to take it in March should we approve it?

The deal closure is the same day as the termination date We are considering the new company will be an affiliate of our company. If the deal closes tonight and the new owner wants to put all employees on their payroll the same day, would that be considered a continuation of employment so that waiting time penalties would not be an issue?	
6	Hello, if we terminate an employee, do we have to give their final check on the spot? Or is there a time frame in which we need to deliver the check to them?	
3	Thank you! The group agreed that they should eat the cost of the lost premium amount in the case of an employee terminating on the 7th (for example) but being covered until the end of the month. do we need to edit any language in the SPD to reflect this?	
4	An employee in our San Francisco office provided her supervisor with her letter of resignation, indicating that her last day will be October 6. The supervisor notified her yesterday that yesterday will be her last day. Does that change the nature of the separation, and do we still need to pay her for the 2 weeks?

Is there a final notice I should send her or have her sign any final paper work? Do you have a sample letter that I can send to her? She was supposed to return on the 28th and on the 27th she emailed saying she was not returning? She did respond back saying she was resigning as of that date.

4	An employee is voluntarily resigning with her last day being 9/29. Yesterday she was in a meeting with the owner and they bumped heads so she said she would work from home. It's unclear if she plans on working from home today only or the rest of the week. We don't trust her completely. What forms do we need to provide?

4	We will be terminating 7 employees due to reduction in force. I would like to discuss the termination of one employee who has been on a very reduced schedule due to allergies. Her absences and have been excessive. Since last November she has not worked a full week, she averages as low as 13 hours per pay period on a regular basis and her certification was only for potential flare-ups in a one-month period.

4	Since July 2017 we've been trying to terminate a sales employee - Maria, for work poor performance. We've been giving her chances to improve herself but she never did. September 19, 2017 we decided to let her go at the end of the month. Maria have been sending us emails saying she's not well due to a fall she sustained on her vacation at the end of August. Then she emailed again today saying she would like to ask for 1 week off due to her pain. I wanted to let her go this week, but with her email today, can I legally let her go now?	
1	I discovered the group chat yesterday when cleaning the computer an exiting employee wanted to buy. I discovered the corrosive chat group on Skype. A trusted employee has been stepped up to the publishing group, negative corrosive, I need to bring on a very strong COO, probably female. Chat group makes fun of people and it borders on harassment of certain individuals - calling people dumb. Telling people not to do something I told them to do. I feel I have two choices - terminate all 5 of them for harassment, for cause. But some are not the trouble makers. Or the option is to take the 3 they have no question about and do our planned layoff. (More likely) it would be cleaner and easier than to mention this thread. I want to use this as a teaching moment and may say I discovered the chat and that it borders on harassment. Should I terminate all 5? I'll file the fucking harassment charge myself. Would you recommend layoff or for cause termination? I may have to pay UI if I layoff. What is your opinion in mentioning the chat group, the terminations, layoffs, or in a staff meeting. Only one is a member of management, maybe two. I need to be told by my partners and CFO on what to do. We are going to lose money this year. Documentation goes back months for the layoffs. There's only one manager that's in question. When I addressed her negativity with her she burst into tears and we can't carry her salary - there's no revenue coming in. I just don't ... I was supposed to be in DC to meet with an investor. My partners are debating the other two people and their value. If its justified, I could do layoffs for 2, or 3, or 4 of these individuals or do a for cause termination for the manager. Can I tell the manager its terminable?	
5	We have an employee who is a field worker. The supervisor contacted us saying they are a no call no show and has not been here since 9/23. He has had excessive absences and used all his sick pay. He asked if he could let him go. I told him yes, as long as they tried to call him. Today they had the final check ready but then he sent in a doctors note that said on 9/26 he was seen by a doctor. This note is saying he had some kind of groin strain in it. Our policy is that after 3 days of no call no show it is job abandonment.

1	Follow-up to Laura's question: typically the last in the door is the first out. But the newer employees are better performers than the bottom performers, but there are is no proof of the issues for the bottom performers. What are are the risks if we keep this one new hire. All are white males under age 40? Is documenting and writing all of that before the 11th hour? What are the bona fide reasons to decide to do a layoff?	
6	Employee who calls in and quits previous date, then comes in the next day to get exit paperwork and final check. Do I need to pay for them to complete exit paperwork?

1	We are going through a small round of layoffs. I want to make sure we are doing it the right way. We have 32 FT staff and 2 are a married couple. Both have PhDs, and we decided the program they are working on is going in a different direction and there isn't room for them. We plan on notifying them at the same time. Have each of them in different rooms, each room has two executives. We will deactivate their access to shared folders/files. Another person is also getting laid off and we already told him. He is staying for the rest of the week. Should he be at the meeting when we inform the rest of the staff? Any guidance you have on notification of the employees and the forms we need to provide would be great.	
5	An employee has given us his two weeks notice. Are we required to let him work the two week or can we tell him that his last day is Friday? What if he puts our clients at risk due to his behavior in the next two weeks will he still be eligible for unemployment?	
3	We recently terminated a high level executive on 9/18. We have drafted a severance package and I'm unsure what is completely in it. I know it currently does not have anything related to benefits, but that could be renegotiated. My boss, the president, would like to just keep the employee on active status until the severance runs out for the purposes of benefit administration. I have advised him that it would not be a good idea because of the 18 month window of COBRA (basically, it gives the terminated employee extra time for COBRA benefits). I also suggested that it is better to pay any benefit through COBRA to avoid it being seen as an unfair practice in health care benefit administration. Other than these issues, are there other concerns about keeping a former employee on "active" status when they are really terminated?	
6	I have a co-worked who I just found out passed away. I needed guidance on how to handle her final pay and if there is anything else I need to be aware of. Do I stop direct deposit? Should I do a live check? I have her mom down as a beneficiary for life insurance.

0	We have a policy to pay out unused vacation hours upon termination if the employee worked for 90 days or more. Is this compliant with Pennsylvania laws? The employee thinks he is owed unused vacation pay, but he has worked less than 90 days with us. Thanks!	
5	We have an employee that was recently arrested and held in jail for a few days until he was bailed out (this was a domestic matter). He returned to work for several days and now has been arrested again. We do not know how long he will be in jail as we have not heard from him. My questions are 1 - can we terminate him on any grounds if we should choose to do so that would not cause any legal issues - 2 - should we terminate him because of this matter? Meaning - do we cause any legal liabilities for the company for continuing to keep him as an employee? And 3 - what do we do about his health insurance while he is not working and earning anything to pay his premiums from? How long do we have to continue to pay for his health insurance not knowing when or if he will come back?	
5	Issue Received Hi Renee Thank you for the response. We havent replaced this employee though. We have gone without that position filled for the last 18 months and just dont have the work for him when he returns. Business is slow. If he had been working here and not injured, we would have let him go months ago due to being slow and not needing the position hes in any longer. Does that make a difference in your answer? Thanks!

4	We have a part-time employee that works as the receptionist at our medical clinic. She is first point of contact. She is not performing up to par, and her customer service is lacking.

5	I've given someone a couple of warnings, we've got that documented. Yesterday we sat down and went over some specific problems and told them we need a couple days to write this up and we are going to put him on a performance improvement plan. That evening he did insubordination. I would like to allow him to stay on until he finds a new job, which also allows us to find a new employee and I don't know how to do that. Quality of work has been an ongoing thing, he questions and fights with his direct superior. Most recently, last week I told him to check in with me with a project but I went to his office and he was not there and he said he had a doctors appointment. I asked him to draw something a certain way and he drew it a different way and when I asked him about it, he said he just made the direction to do it a certain way. Previously we our process has been that we give a couple of warnings, then a PIP as their last chance. However, based on that incident we have decided against putting him on a performance improvement plan.	
4	We are in CA Payroll is processed in Wisconsin. A nurse is remaining on call through Saturday. We are having to process the checks the day before the RIF. We have an employee that her last day on Saturday. She has on call hours but which we can estimate, but not if she receives on-call time. I'm thinking best to process check for Friday then process a final check on Monday. But she wouldn't get final check until Tuesday. If we paid all her of her time tomorrow and all we would owe her is weekend time, wouldn't the risk be lower since it is such a small amount of pay?	
1	We are appealing someones request for unemployment. Crossing t's and dotting i's. I have digital copies of everything in secure location on our server. 9/26/2017 actual date on letter. Mailing today.	
2	I would like a copy of the HIPP form that is provided at termination.	
2	Michigan involuntary termination.	
4	We have a long time employee who has had a series of write-ups over the years. Most recently she failed to report a potential incident of abuse. This is terminable offense, but as she is a long time employee we would like to offer her the option to resign. Primarily because she would not otherwise have the option to be paid out her PTO. What else should we consider with this option?	
4	We have an employee who has been out for 21 weeks due to hand pain. Her FMLA has long been exhausted, and in the midst of all of this she's filed a WC claim. Can we proceed with termination?	
2	An employee was laid off. Is that considered an involuntary or voluntary termination? We are paying him additional 2 weeks earnings as severance (no agreement required). Is that supplemental earnings taxed at the higher rate?

5	My employee sent his resignation in for October 4 and I do not want to pay for his health insurance next month. Can I terminate him today and give him a severance for the three days next week so I do not need to pay the health premium?	
4	I am needing to make a change in personnel. I have a person that has worked with me for about a year. She does so many things so well. and I know that her capability is there; she cannot get the focus or organizational skills and she is very much not present at times. I have addressed this with her and she improves for a short period of time and then goes back. I have gone through all termination checklist. I am trying to figure out how to make this very amicable. I want to give her a good reference. What is the best way to do this termination? Typically she has been open and has acknowledged that there are things that she needs to improve upon.	
3	We have an employee who has been with us about a month an a half. They give them procedures for clocking out. He will leave early and not report it. It gets discovered. They don't think it's working out. Would like to discuss termination	
6	We have an employee who quit without notice. We know that we have 72 hours to provide the final paycheck. Is this 72 business hours?	
4	I had a question regarding at will in California. Our agreement states that the employer and employee can terminate employment at any time. I have never terminated anyone. We have a new hire but she is not up to par in her position. She is forgetful and we have to keep reminding her of the job responsibilities.	
4	I have an employee who we are terminating for various reasons. We are an at-will employer and I need a sample at-will termination letter. We have an employee who has been with us for under 90-days and she was ill due to bronchitis. She was sent home by our office manager and the was out all week. She failed to call in to a shift, and we are going to let her go. Is this permissible?	
4	UI in California: a woman was here for a very long time and got involved with an individual who lives in Vegas. He was her fiancee, she quit, moved there, and filed for UI. She appealed and won the appeal based on McGregor v California (trying to keep the family together). This is the first time we lost and we can appeal. How does this work? Is it worth it? How does this affect our "account." We will not get a bill, then? She said they were getting married in March, if they didn't and we found out they didn't get married, could we appeal?	
5	Employee is being insubordinate. We sent him home yesterday after his outburst. He was supposed to come in today at 9:30 am for his schedule. He called out saying he wasn't coming in due to child being sick. Our handbook states insubordination results in immediate termination. We were going to terminate him today. We were having a quick chat with him about following protocol. We have addressed this behavior (protocol, demeanor, counterproductive, responding well to management) in multiple conversations. We feel he is a toxic individual now and want to let him go. We are thinking about giving him the option to resign and we will give recommendation letter or we will terminate him. He has been employed here since 2011. I filled out a write up form and was hoping to give it to him. He may not show up, but he doesn't have paid time off or anything.	
4	I have an employee that was only working for a month. We were going to let her go and then she came to us an put in her 2 week notice in and we let her go first thing the next morning. Do we have to pay her for the 2 weeks? The employee is in Washington.	
6	An employee resigned and gave 2 weeks notice. I wanted to confirm that we owe her a final check because she gave more than 72 hours notice.	
4	Our Senior Manager associate reports to our Director. The senior manager associate moved to Hawaii and the company agreed that she would continue employment. However, after an analysis of her travel, it has become a financial burden. The Director met with the employee and disclosed that the arrangement was not working. However, she has disclosed to me that she may have a medical condition that may qualify her for FMLA. The director would like to set another meeting with the employee, but the employee has requested that it be postponed because of a doctor's appointment. Can we still terminate her?	
1	ADEA when we are terminating more than one person, when do we have to comply with the additional notice requirements?	
5	An employee was a no call/no show 3 days in a row. We termed the employee and hired someone else to fill the position. The no call/no show employee came into the office that same day demanding his job. We told him that he had been termed. Monday the termed employee showed up for work. We reiterated what we had told him before. He said he would sue us. Now his girlfriend is calling asking to talk to HR. Have we done anything wrong?	
2	Hi Erin, Thank you very much! Can you please share the sample termination letter with us as well? Happy Monday!	
3	We received an employment verification for a former employee that left on good terms. How much can we share with the new prospective employer?	
1	We are terminating an employee due to cause. The employee has been counseled in the past for making offensive comments to other employees in the past. The lewd comments continue. What termination documents should we provide?	
1	We have two employees that, when present are lazy. Both are working the system and continue to submit medical excuses from their physicians to be off work for 90 days at a time. One employee has been out for 15 months, the other a period of 4 months. How do we address, as we are aware they party over the weekend and may have alternative employment (paid under the table)? We are a 24-7 emergency dispatch towing service.	
4	I received an EDD Notice of UI Claim filed for a person we were looking to let go and finally did. Retaliation and wrongful termination are the reasons cited by the employee. I called you 10 times on this one employee. We finally had enough of it. Do I corroborate her story? She complained in the sense in the administrative meetings "I get stressed out when people don't reserve conference rooms..." She has not complained of discrimination or harassment. We told her she was being terminated for tardies. We called you 10 times about this. What do we need to do?	
6	Question regarding Employee's Final Pay Good Morning, We have two employees that just got incarcerated over this weekend and are not able to pick up their paycheck. We have not heard from them and they don't have any authorization in place for someone else to pickup their check. What options do we have as their employer? How long can we hold an employee's paycheck? Can we hold on to their check until they get out? Should we mail it to their address even if we don't have a verbal or written from them?	
4	We have a recent graduate joined the firm about a month ago and it was disclosed she wrote a paper at school and it's being reviewed by the BAR association. She hasn't been to work in about a month since she's so distraught that she may not get licensed. She's still getting paid and she's not working for us. How should we handle? She has some client contacts so the firm doesn't want to go hard-cord but something needs to be done.	
3	Reference letters. An employee leaves the company and asks the employer to write a reference letter. What are the best practices?	
5	An employee has unofficially announced that he is leaving to move out of state. Can we request that he write a formal letter of resignation?	
6	Our technicians have uniforms provided to them. When we terminate an employee, are we within our rights to withhold a portion of their final check, until all uniformas have been returned.	
4	Hello, We have an employee in CA whose department is being located to another city and she will not be making the transition. She is the only employee affected and over 40. We are planning to lay her off, are there specific documents we are required to give her related to the layoff and not just for a regular termination? Thank you, Chris	
3	Systolic, Inc. is a client with 92 employees. They have a cobra question: "Our employees are paid on a delay so after their date of termination, they still receive around 6 weeks of pay. Can we deduct COBRA premiums from their pay (same as if they were still an active employee) or do all COBRA premiums have to be paid via check from the employee to SYSTOLIC?" Can you assist in answering this question? Thanks	
3	It's regarding termination. Is there any law and reference to someone giving their resignation 4 weeks out. Manager wants to release the employee immediately; can the employer do this?	
0	You answered our question, In the state of California do you have to pay out vacation if you decrease an employee's hour and salary? Your answer was, no. Now we would like to know, when we do terminate the employee at what rate do we pay out the accrued vacation? If we changed salary for example on April 1 do we pay out all accrued vacation prior to April at old the old salary and all vacation accrued after April 1 at the new salary or do we just pay vacation out at all accrued vacation out at the new salary?	
4	We have a new employee who used 1 extra day of vacation that was not yet accrued. Thinking she was here for the long run, we allowed her to go into the negative. She has now given notice. Am I allowed to deduct the one day from her paycheck and or request that she cut us a check for the one day?	
3	In California, is it possible for us to write... We'll train an employee and they will go work for a government.	
4	Our question is in regards to FMLA. We were ready to terminate an employee at our company the next day, but she was out the day we were planning it. We had planned to terminate her the next day when she returned. Then we got a notification that she had to be out on FMLA through this entire week. Then she called to say she wanted to come back early. We told her she could not return early without a doctors note releasing her to return to work prior to the original release date. The reasons we were going to terminate her involve: She was saying in a meeting earlier in the week that she could kill that other employee, wish I could kill that employee, go into the employees office and destroy things, would never do it, but its how Im feeling some times. On top of other things, there is a history between the two employees. She was involved with a sexual harassment investigation earlier this year. We removed her from that situation as the complainant per her request, and moved her to report to someone else, performing her same job. That new supervisor has been supervising has started to identify where she is missing the bar and sees that her performance is subpar, as well as the fact that her workplace behavior is inappropriate. We were considering writing her up, but then in light of these most recent comments, we dont want to keep her and planned for her termination. In the past she had let her supervisor and I know that she was seeing a mental health professional.	
1	We are potentially looking to terminate an employee that is not creatively aligned with our principal and was wondering what things we need to do on our end before we move forward with the termination. This individual was hired in a creative capacity.	
3	If an employee quit, but the employer pays them through their resignation date, is hat still considered a resignation?	
6	Resignation and final check. An exempt employee who resigned with 30 day notice but then called in later at night and quite on the spot. When do I have to issue the final check and do I have to pay out the notice period?	
1	We are a California construction company. My questions surround layoffs for carpenters when work is slow. (Or rain delays may be another example.) We currently have a couple of guys that we won't have work for, for the next couple of weeks. Can they file for unemployment? Do I have to formally terminate them - then rehire them in a couple of weeks when we know we will have work? Any upfront paperwork required from us? I know EDD will send verification of hours. Thank you! Leona	
1	Hello. We have an engineer that was hired to work on site in NC. He had personal issues and needed to move to Virginia and work remotely. We told the employee that we would try him working remotely but now a few months later it is not working out. We have received feedback that this engineer is not providing the level of technical support expected and not able to interact and collaborate effectively with the rest of the engineering team. We do not have any performance related issues documented. We do not mind stating that it is a reduction in force so that he would be able to file for unemployment. Are there any legal issues or any other exposures if we terminate his employment? Is there at benefit or cause for concern if we term it performance based verses a reduction in force? Thank you.	
4	Employee working in MN is on maternity leave. She gave her 2 weeks notice that she is resiging first week of May. She wants us to pay out all of her accrued vacation, but our policy is that we only pay out 50%. And, she wants her benefits to continue through end of May. How should we manage?	
5	We called an employee last night and asked him to come to the shop early in the morning. He asked if he would be terminated and we tried to avoid stating that but had to say yes. The employee didn't show up and we haven't been able to reach him all day. Is it still a termination at this point or a no-call, no-show?	
1	If an employee submits a voluntary resignation and we choose to let them go sooner will that still be voluntary?	
4	We terminated an employee yesterday. The position was eliminated. She was pregnant and we offered a severance agreement. Another option was that she could apply for another vacant position. Do you think there is risk?	
4	EDD Notice of UI Claim - one of my employees decided to resign after an incident. She is claiming verbal and mental abuse. I have to admit my voice my raised. I asked her if she had an explanation. "My God why would you do that!?" My client asked her to put her drink in the refrigerator "I'm busy." What constitutes verbal and mental abuse? We were just talking over the phone, and your voice gets louder over the phone. The EDD called me as I was unaware of the mail. I responded that there were other issues. I thought she was filing a claim that she had health issues. There was a pleasant resignation letter and I was not aware of any of any health issues. I reprimanded her and she found out she was pregnant. I told her not to lift and told the client not to let her left and I was going to move her to a job with no lifting. I told her these things on my own. I told her to be careful. It was pretty much an agreement. I told her to get a doctor's note that she was ok to work. She wanted that/appreciated that. The EDD mentioned health issues. I was surprised she resigned.	
2	Termination separation in Texas. Is there any special separation form I have to use?	
6	Hello, we are a retail company based out of California. For final paychecks for our CA based employees, are we required to deliver the final paycheck on their last day scheduled to work, or on their last day listed on their resignation letter? For example, an employee may give a 2-week notice listing their final date of employment as May 1st, but their last scheduled shift/day worked may be earlier on April 25th. Which date would we be required to give their final check on?	
1	We have an employee who has been having issues with absenteeism. We have written her up and she's been out again. What should we consider if we want to proceed with termination?	
2	Employer is terminating an employee tomorrow and giving employee a severance package. Is there a consideration period required? OWBPA Separation Agreement/s Signature Line	
0	Follow up question regarding payout of vacation upon termination. Trying to resolve the offer of employment we did not specifically mention in the job offer that vacation would be paid. She also has personal time off.	
1	I need assistance with how the California WARN Act affects employers. We have approx. 130 employees, both full (45) and part-time (85) at several amenities at our Homeowners Association. Our Admin Office has approx. 15 employees. As a result of budget cuts for the upcoming fiscal year we may need to layoff 2-3 of our part-time employees from the Admin Office. Would the WARN act apply to this situation, since this is not a mass layoff? With our new fiscal year starting on 7/1, we were hoping to release at the end of May versus having to do a 60 day notification.	
3	Natalie called in with a question. She is the relatively new HR Director for Health Platforms and is in process of getting onto the account. She has confirmed with JustWorks that they have all of her information and they told her she should have been added. We have a CA employee who was terminated yesterday. His last day will be today, and they are paying him through today. While they want today to technically be the end of his employment, they want to keep him on payroll until May15th so he would have benefits through the end of the month. Please cc Natalie - nathalier@corp.doctor.com, 786-391-5106, Nathalie Rodriguez	
4	Employee has been with us a month. We are looking at terminating her for cause. She let a resident out of building and got into a screaming altercation during training. She also she asked for time off for a foster placement and we denied her because she had not been here long enough. Now, she is filing a workers compensation claim stating she hurt her back after changing adult diapers. Can we still process the termination?	
3	We are preparing some separation and release agreements. Do they have a waiting period? Is there a requirement that I need to include on the form that it must be signed in a certain amount of time?	
3	Natalie called in with a question. She is the HR person for Health Platforms and is in process of getting onto the account. CA employee was terminated yesterday. Last day will be today, and they are paying him through today. She wanted to know if there was a form for termination that needs to be filled out and given to the employee.	
5	Melissa - mbacker@pypestream.com We are terminating an employe in CA. Just received from EDD, he filed for UI 4/13/17. He didn't sign the termination letter yet but he is claiming his last day was 4/9. What should I do?	
2	If you categorize a discharge as a temporary layoff, what kind of responsibilities do we have to them?	
1	We have an exempt employee who gave two week notice - do we have to pay her through the two weeks? Do we have to offer her medical coverage?	
4	An employee resigned and we had her leave early but did not pay her for the days she did not work. Must we pay out her accrued PTO? Another employee is going out on pregnancy leave. I have less than 50 employees and I am unable to hold her job for her. May I terminate her employment, and would I pay out her PTO? Are there risks if I terminate her? I have no written policy that discusses an employee forfeiting their PTO at time of separation.	
0	I had an employee who resigned. We decided not to have her come back for the notice period. At that point, I understand we have to pay out her unused PTO, right? My PTO policy is that it accrues each pay period. Each pay period is .5. She was only here for 12 pay periods. Do I pay her for what she would have accrued for the 12 pay periods or the full annual amount?	
3	2. Individual stylist licenses need to be renewed. If individual doesn't renew their license can I terminate them, and would that make them eligible for unemployment? If they subsequently got the license renewed am I obligated to take them back?	
3	An employee has expressed interest of a different career path, we invest a lot in our employees for their long term growth. They are an entry-level position and has been here for 9 months. Is there a way for us to terminate the employment with a cause?	
1	I have a general question, what is the timeframe to hire for a position that was impacted during reduction of workforce. We are hoping to be back to business in 6 months and we might have to fill positions impacted during this move. 1. How soon can we fill a position that was RIF? 2. R&D dept. not much development going on. Can we offer a PT position with lower wage as 1099? 3. Can we pay a new person on trial for two weeks on AP, then hire them on W-2?	
6	We have a final check for an employee, however unreturned equipment and unapproved credit card charges exceed the amount of the paycheck. I need to figure out what to do with the check and how to make sure it's reflected on his W2 accurately. Technically he still made the money correct?	
6	Can an employer withhold funds from an employees final check to pay tuition reimbursement, if the employee authorized it in writing?	
2	8-5 shift. project later shift 7pm - 3 am	
4	Following up on previous call. Does it make sense to write a conversational letter with the reason for termination and give to her? I am trying to come up with a way to explain why she isn't here anymore in case I get reference calls. I hired her for 30 hours a week - but have been using her for 33 or 35. I want to offer to her that I would say I needed 40 hours?	
3	Hi, I'm looking for some resources or best practices in regards to Hiring Managers serving a references for previous employees. Is it a best practice to inform Hiring Managers if they wish to serve as a reference they are doing so independently of the company? Or should all reference requests strictly be funneled through HR. Any resources or best practices you can provide on this subject is greatly appreciated. Thank you.	
5	We have an employee with continued performance problems. When addressing a customer satisfaction issue with him, he seem to get very agitated and angry. This last time, we approached him about a complaint and he became very confrontational and then left without authorization. Can we terminate him?	
1	Hi, I have an employee who was let go yesterday due to property theft. I am issuing last payroll check today but we owe this employee some amount as expense reimbursement. Do we need legally reimburse this employee or can we keep this amount? Please advise.	
4	One of our employees, a supervisor, did not report to work for a number of days. Did not respond to requests from her supervisor who reached out. Employee came in, apologized, let employer know that her mother had some issues - employee found out she had cancer. She understood the consequences of her behavior. Advice on how we should proceed? In addition, we had an employee who said she had inflammation in her arm and couldn't do her regular duties. Can we ask for a doctors note? Lastly, an employee stopped coming to work, and was notified of termination due to job abandonment. When he came in to get his final check he said he stopped working since he had an injury related to work. We were never notified of an injury, no injuries were reported and this is new news to us. Do we have to do anything?	
2	Do you have anything on best practices for employers when they agree to pay cobra premiums for a period of time as a severance agreement?	
2	What exit paperwork do you recommend we provide to an employee who is resigning? Do you provide any forms for this purpose?	
6	If a terminated employee has company property, can you wait until the property is returned before giving the final payroll check?	
3	Can an employee collect unemployment the employee resigns voluntarily?	
4	We have an employee who resigned last Wednesday. My husband and I were sitting down with her to discuss some issued we'd been having with client that she'd not kept us abreast of and she informed us that she'd been planning on resigning at the end of the year and she was gong to resign now. We all agreed that she would give us until 10/13 as this was also through the end of our next payroll cycle. We asked her for a written resignation letter. Today I followed back up and requested the letter and she's refusing to provide the letter stating that this was all a mutual agreement and she was not going to sign anything. This was not our understanding. We had met with her to understand the issues with out clients and why they'd stopped some orders. She resigned, we accepted the resignation. To make things more complex she has an open WC issue, but I've verified with our carrier that her resignation will in no way impact her claim. How should we best proceed?	
5	An employee resigned saying his last day would be October 5. His last day at work was the 24th. He didn't show up Monday and we called him and he said he got a vacation day. He didn't show up Tuesday and Wednesday and when I spoke to him he said his boss told him not to come in anymore. I talked to his boss and he said that he never said that. I processed the final check but the employee is saying we owe him waiting time penalties. I'm not going to pay that I'll take my chances. He has our company property that we need returned. He asked for the check to be mailed.	
4	Have temp receptionist who is not 'getting it'. Has made several mistakes, manager has received complaints on her performance and phone demeanor. We have met on a daily basis with her to review issues - there are no surprises that things arent working out. I need to terminate her. How do I communicate this?	
4	Employee has medical issues and has missed a lot of work. She has doctors notes for most of the absences, but not all of them. What can we do to get rid of her? She has missed 28 days and has only been her since May.	
6	Hello,, We are having a lot of employees not returning company equipment in California. We are not deducting it from final paycheck but short of sending them a letter from the attorney, what would be other options of recourse?	
4	I have an employee who we hoped to get a grant to keep employing her and we did not and we are going to have to let her go. She was with us for a year and was employed before she worked for us. How will unemployment work? Her last day is October 15th in Pennsylvania I am assuming that she will have coverage through the last day?	
3	Hi, I have two situations for job abandonment: 1. New hire only showed up for 1/2 day training. Left early due to an emergency. The manager reached out on 3 occasions we have not heard back.

0	I have an employee who has given his notice. The twist is we took over management of the club and carried over some of the benefits of the management. This person had personal time. We don't offer personal time. He is asking for a pay out of the personal time as wells as the vacation time. Do we need to pay that out?	
4	New employee, took position, got in the system, worked Mon-Tues. On Wednesday she called and said she has Strep throat, won't come in until Thursday. She called out on Thursday morning. Thursday evening, she called and said she had slept all day, will be out Friday. No show Monday. Is this job abandonment? I've called and left messages but have not heard from her.	
5	Hi, Can the employee pay back for charges occurred prior to his resignation since he knew he was leaving the company. Our company mobilize people from state to state ( flights, cars, housing, daily per diem) I have an employee who lied about being sick and stayed in the apt. and this morning provided his notice saying that he had found employment and this was the reason. He scheduled his own flight for Tuesday. Our process is once the person provides the notice, we purchase a ticket to fly back and inspect the living arrangements to turn in the keys. Are we obliged to house him and the car rental since he gave his notice as of 7 am?	
3	Hi. I have a client that has a recently deceased senior level employee who was involved in a tragic accident in August. It has come to light that this employee has not yet been "terminated" from employment via HRIS, payroll or benefits to help the family better cope and prepare. Is there any compliance concerns that they need to be aware of because of this?	
4	We have an employee who has submitted her resignation a couple of months ago. We have been negotiating with her on her end date and about shifting departments and not resigning. Last week she told us she applied for another job and they would be calling for reference. New resignation date. We wanted to see if she could end last Friday -she was not comfortable. Then we said to end this Friday. She has not been performing well. We have email correspondence but nothing formal or no disciplinary track. Would like to discuss.	
1	Also, what is the best process to terminate team members. Do we give them a termination letter and do we have to have them sign something? Are there different laws in different states?	
3	If an employee is on SDI, and they don't return to work, will they lose their SDI eligibility? For example, they have to be laid off while on disability. What if an employee is laid off and goes on unemployment, then becomes unable to work due to a disability (pregnancy)? In reference to unemployment insurance benefits, if the employer offers severance paid out over a period of time (rather than as a lump sum) would this delay the ability to get unemployment benefits?	
1	A male kitchen employee had inappropriately touched a female server on Saturday evening, resulting in a claim of sexual harassment. We have video cameras in our restaurant and the altercation was videotaped. We have a zero tolerance policy for sexual harassment and our policy is posted in the break area. We are going to terminate the employee. What are the risks? Can we tell the employee why we are terminating him? Can we let him know that it is on videotape?

4	I have an employee that quit but she filed for unemployment. I am about to file an appeal. I think that is the next step. I want to make sure I am filling out form correctly. She started showing up late to work, stating car problems, day care issues, etc. One day she didn't show up at all. We called her and she said she needed to quit due to difficulties at home.	
4	We had an employee come into work one day and said that she was in an abusive relationship and that she was leaving that day. She left a couple of hours later and she left. She actually left the state of MASS where we are located. We asked her for a letter of termination and a forwarding address but she didn't do that. I know she's not at the address I have on file and I called the cell phone number that I have on file twice asking her to return my phone call. I need to know where to mail her final pay stub and her COBRA information. She hasn't returned either phone call and I don't know what to do. I'm not really worried about her pay stub. It went direct deposit so I feel confident that she has her money this is just a pay stub. But I do not know how to handle the COBRA. I don't know her address now. I just know she isn't at the address I have on file anymore. I don't have a current address and she has not returned either phone calls that I have made.	
4	We are planning on terminating an employee due to poor work performance. She has been spoken to in the past, but no documentation. She has some physical limitations and a psychological problem, but I do not believe that her manager has discussed any type of reasonable accommodation. Please advise. What if we gave her a severance?	
3	I have a group that wants to pay for an employees cobra for the first 3 months. They want to include this in his severence package. Can they legally do that? If so, how can they make it fair to any other employee that might not be offered the same deal? He is an executive of the company, does that make a difference?	
2	Can you terminate an independent contractor with no recourse?

1	We are eliminating a position and while we did offer other vacancies, some have chosen to accept a termination and severance. Would they still be eligible for unemployment benefits?	
4	There is an employee that is here thinking about terminating here. Written up 3 times last year first warning,. Oct last year and then a third written warning again. Not for the same thing. In manual it says involuntary termination: Violation of policy can lead to disciplinary action up to termination. Our manual says we are at-will. The first one she was sleeping at her desk. The other one was break time and she did not return from break in a timely manner. Went offsite without authorization. The third one was attendance. She called in Friday and did not come in today. The GM wants to make sure we're covered if she does not come in. Today she called in sick. I don't know what the reason was for Friday.	
3	We got a phone call from another care home and they said they received a letter of recommendation written by one of our managers for one of our employees. The manager named on the letter claimed they did not write the letter. We want to know if we can terminate the employee for this.	
5	We have a group with a CBA with a new hire who was brought in as an apprentice. He is required to test at the end of period of time and he does not want to test, and would prefer to stay as a journeyman at the same rate of pay. The supervisor would like to let him go. Can they do that?	
5	We have an employee who broke a finger. He was to have gone to the doctor, and then brought back in a doctor's note. His manager talked to him on Monday, 9/25 and no on has heard from his since then. We did not put his on the schedule because we did not have the note from the doctor, but it looks like maybe he did not go to the doctor in the L & I system. How do we proceed? Can we terminate him? We are in WA?	
4	I have an employee at my San Francisco office who is making things a little difficult. She had a performance review and wasn't meeting expectations. As we were going to describe the PIP process, she said she was thinking of leaving. The manager says she confirmed she wanted to resign as of October 27th. We had a conversation with her to let her go as of Oct. 6 and we would give her severance through 27th. She then said she wouldn't agree to anything until she saw the severance. I sent the severance agreement to her. We had a conversation with the employee to tell her we were not going to revert to the PIP and we were going to go through with the severance agreement. She is saying she does not agree to the severance because she did not provide resignation in writing. She is also saying she now wants 6 months of severance.	
5	An employee was laid off due to a combination of poor performance and reduced business needs. We laid him off with the expectation of calling him back. I spent a couple of months attempting to recover his company-issued cell phone. When I finally received it the bill tied to that phone number was up to $1,200. Now that this has happened, we're not open to bringing him back when business picks up. I would like to know what options I have in terms of the unemployment benefits that were awarded and recovering the cost of the bill.	
5	We have an employee with attendance issues and poor performance. He has recently replaced bad material with bad material for a client. When I asked him about it I asked if he cared about his job and he said he really didn't. I have suspended him home several times due to performance. I'm ready to terminate him.	
4	We have a long term employee that we will be laying off due to the needs of the business. She has a personal loan that she has notified us of. Can we ask her how much she owes on that loan to help us determine her severance amount? The loan is not an employer loan.	
2	Will you please send me all the paperwork needed to terminated a non-exempt employee in California?	
4	Hi There, The message got cut off. The other questions were: What termination date do I use? Today or February 4th , which would have been her last shift? Would it be beneficial to have her sign something saying she voluntarily resigned and that we paid out her 2 week notice? Both the GM and I were on the call with her, and I think thats adequate proof when we sign her internal termination Do we pay her a gross dollar amount, or enter her usual hours another non-working hours field, like vacation pay? Please advise, thank you.	
1	We are eliminating a department - there's only one person. She falls under a couple of protected categories. We are giving her two weeks notice and the unemployment resources.	
0	If an employee accrues 15 days vacation and the person is let go (reduction in force, department no longer needed), does the company have to pay out accrued vacation upon termination or can they say that they will not pay out?	
6	A supervisor has made the decision to terminate a long term employee. File includes a number of write up. Final incident occurred when the employee, who is a housekeeper, pushed her cart into another employee. The employee denied the action, however we have witness statements.

1	We have two separate companies and EINs but we are all in one building with one set of ownership. The businesses works in conjunction with the other. One company is the medical biller (masked) and one is the medical billing collections agency (Gragil). We lost a client in the collections side and the amount of work has gone down and there is a need in the other. This would mean transferring between the two. We have people we asked to move. 2 said no. I don't want to lay off - due to unemployment.	
6	Just terminated an employee and he refused to sign final paperwork or take his final check. Employer plans to mail all of the paperwork and final check to the employee overnight. Now they realized that he may have company property, a computer, what can they do?	
1	We are seeking re-organization which may come with layoffs and location closures in California. Are there notice requirement relating to advanced notice of these changes to impacted staff? These will occur in San Diego and San Francisco. Can you also advise what is a "material change in employment" in California? We are mainly looking for a possible "distance" reference in connection to what is and is not reasonable.	
1	We have an employee that we let go. We are now going through the unemployment hearing stage. We heard from one of our employees that the former employee is reaching out to other employees via Facebook asking for their assistance with a letter. This employee did not respond, but another employee did. What, if anything, should the employer do at this point? Should we talk to the employee who responded?	
5	We have an employee who we transferred to another position because his original position was eliminated. We essentially created another position for him. It's only been a week and he has already mentioned to his supervisor and other people that he doesn't know why he wasn't fired. He also has not completed a task that we recently assigned to him.	
2	Are there any Nevada specific state required notices that need to be provided to en employee that is being terminated? Company Headquearters in in California bit there are some employees in Nevada.	
2	I am having to terminate for no call no show. What I am not certain of is what I need to send them.	
6	We are a agriculture company that utilizes seasonal workers compensated on a per-piece rate. Our season will be ending soon and we will be laying off workers. Because workers are paid by piece rate , we can not finalize calculations and have final checks available on their last day. What is the timeframe to deliver final payout to laid off employee?	
6	We are terminating an employee tomorrow and have final wages ready to go. He is scheduled for a termination meeting, however if he does not show up - how do we issue final wages?	
5	I have an employee with a company credit card. He has used the company card for personal items and we have been deducting these costs from his payroll check. He is now terminating and we want to deduct what he owes from his pay. Is this allowed in Tennessee?	
2	Must we give the CA EDD 2320 Notice at time of separation?	
2	protecting against wrongful termination	
6	We are laying off one employee. Must we give his final check today, or can we pay him DD next week with regular payroll?	
1	We have an employee who gave two weeks notice and don't want to continue this employment. Can do this?	
6	We have a final check for an employee, however unreturned equipment and unapproved credit card charges exceed the amount of the paycheck. I need to figure out what to do with the check and how to make sure it's reflected on his W2 accurately. Technically he still made the money correct?	
4	I am going to let one of our employees go. I want to make sure that the wording in her termination letter is OK. Not meeting the expectations of the job.. She has had several customer complaints. She is disrespectful to managers and other workers. We counseled her and were are having several issues if not worse.	
1	We are looking to term an employee who is located in California. We are located in New York. When it comes to the final pay and termination documents, how can we manage this remotely?	
5	We have an employee who has been with us for exactly 6 weeks and is in his 90-day probationary period. During the last 2 weeks, due to a personal situation (nothing that would qualify as a protected class or disability) he has missed roughly 5-6 days of work, came in late without notice, and has admittedly performed sub-par quality work. If we terminate him, we'll likely have to dispute unemployment if he files for it (and since he hasn't done anything that likely would qualify as gross misconduct, we'd likely have to pay it). If he resigns, we wouldn't have to pay. We have decided that he is not working out and need to let him go. Are we allowed to say something along the lines of "if you resign, in the future we can say you resigned and give a more positive reference, as opposed to us terminating you and having to say we terminated you." Or are we not allowed to steer the conversation? And are we required to let him know he qualifies for unemployment or is that up to him to find?	
5	We have been trying to terminate an employee who is on a probationary period. We have documented complaints from employees and customers. Additionally, we have him on video tape stealing company property. We attempted to terminated him two days ago, but his final check was prepared. We tried again yesterday but he evaded all meetings, got on his phone and told us it was his doctor, then left abruptly and said he was going to his doctor. Today he called in sick- we have a feeling that while he was going through the managers desk, that he saw his termination paperwork and is avoiding the meeting. Can we terminate him by phone? If so, how do we send his final check?	
4	Follow up on previous response. https://rockstars.thinkhr.com/portal/basic.php?thePage=issues/issue_profile.php&issueID=354152 The employee first resigned and we told her we were planning on offering her a different position. She accepted and we were working on transitioning her. She then came to us and said she interviewed for another job and will most likely get it. We talked about a transition plan and now she is changing her mind on the last day of work. We do not want to keep her.	
5	We just hired an employee on 9/25/17, who passed the background check and drug screening test prior to hiring. But we just found out he had a court date 9/28/17 in which he plead guilty to use/possession of drug paraphernalia and marijuana-small amount personal use. He is now on probabation for the next 6 months. Is this a legitimate reason to terminate the employee without it being wrongful termination?	
1	We have an employee who just filled a workers' comp claim. Prior to his filing the claim he had multiple attendance issue and we should have let him go. How can we best go about terminating him? This is our slow time of the year, can we lay him off?	
4	FW: SideMark HR Question Good morning- can you help with the questions below. Tristan From: Jennifer Sharpe [mailto:JSharpe@sidemark.com] Sent: Friday, September 29, 2017 10:23 AM To: Tristan Gardner Subject: SideMark HR Question Thanks in advance for your help, We have an individual who is a personal assistant to the Bruce Paul family. She is listed as a SideMark employee, though she is never in the office, she works in their home. The Paul family has decided the her services are no longer needed. I need to get her final pay check and have paperwork signed. I am wondering if there is a legal way to do this electronically. I know that California can be very particular about how and when you deliver an employee's last pay. 1. Do I have the option of sending paperwork to her electronically and ask her to sign and send back via email, then send a paycheck when the paperwork is done? 2. Does she have to physically come into the office, or are their other electronic options? 3. Can I just put what is owed her into her checking account by direct deposit? This is not a "hostile" termination. The Paul family is willing to give her notice and tell her things like....you have until the end of next week. But I don't know if she will be interested in staying or leaving immediately. Advice would be appreciated. Jennifer Sharpe Director of Corporate Services SideMark | We Make Work Feel Good!

1	We have two companies. Under solar our bookkeeper is the daughter of the CEO. She was let go. The GM was also let go. There are commissions owed to the GM and we are paying him out. The GM is her husband. He has asked that any communication regarding commission payments to him go through his wife. Do we have to do that?	
2	I received notices of claims filed with EDD from former independent contractors. Just Works referred me to you. They don't think these individuals will be eligible for unemployment benefits but referred me to you. Additionally, I'm trying to get the employer account number the form requests but I'm not able to locate that number. I want to respond but I'm over the 10 days by about a month. Can you help me?	
3	An employee passed away in California. There is more than $15,000 owed, and I see that California states only a net $15,000 may be paid out to the spouse. Does the rest go through probate?	
1	We have road shows are Costco's across the country and during the holiday's Costco slows down. In the NE, COSTCO will not be allowing any roadshows in NOV, DEC, and JAN. We will need to lay off a total of 8 FT employees and 8 PT employees. How can we best handle this? The impacted states are NY, MA and TX. We would like to re-hire employees. The TX employees will not be re-hired as we will not continue the practice in TX. These employee's be told of the lay off this month. I'd like information regarding outplacement, and we need a RIF termination letter.	
6	There was an employee whose employment was terminated on Oct 2nd. Their premium for medical insurance was not taken out from their final paycheck. Does the company have any recourse to get the employees portion back? Please advise.	
4	We have an employee who has several years of tenure, who we have considered putting on a plan, but that never came to fruition and now the employee is out on leave due to serious health conditions. The employee had a stroke and is currently in acute rehab. She exhausted her FMLA in September and requested to start using PTO (which we approved) which will run out on 10/13. The employee is now in the process of applying for DI. We have absorbed her position internally, with an individual who is more efficient at the work (they complete what took her 40 hours, in 10). The company would like to terminate this individual. What are our options? What legalities do we have? Also, in case it is relevant, she had a previous ADA accommodation for Chron's (unrelated to current condition).	
5	An employee notified us on Friday that he has been called to military duty effective Monday. He then followed up via email stating that he is giving his 2 week notice. How should I manage his military leave and resignation? He is on our group health benefits, has no vacation time available, and his last paycheck was on Friday, which included hours worked on Friday.	
3	If an at-will employee submits a 2 week resignation, is it okay for the employer to release them prior to the 2 weeks if we do not feel they are needed?	
5	We are working on restructuring top to bottom. We have loose policies regarding employee absence. We have an employee that is par-time who had a medical incident;he collapsed incur back room. He stated that he has mini strokes. We had him drug tested;however, he did not provide a clearance for him to return to work. He left by ambulance. He did not produce that. He told the manager that he had to have his probation officer authorize him to return to work. His mother stated that he was picked up by his probation officer. We have no policy about failure to communicate. Are we within our rights to terminate him? He was scheduled to work and has not called or showed up for a week.	
4	2 people in the company. I have a pregnant woman. She has missed work. It makes it difficult to do my job and her job. We have 40 customers. Would like to discuss? She is constantly out due to pregnancy. My wife is pregnant and working and due in December. This person texts me at 4am that she is not feeling well, and I can't afford someone not being here. I know I do not fall under FEHA and PDL. I can still terminate her, I would still be fine...? Its not because she is pregnant but that she is not reliable and can't come to work. I hired her when she was pregnant, she has worked here less than a month. She has missed 8 or 9 days. What do you think about unlimited unpaid PTO in California? We have a balance of unpaid hours. What about a negative balance that we subtract from?	
4	An employee has informed us that she is unable to continue working due to a recent diagnosis of Muscular Dystrophy. She is resigning from her position effective immediately. What documentation should I ask her to provide, and must we pay out her 89 hours of accrued sick leave? Normally, we do not pay it out, but because of her dx, we are wondering if we should??	
1	Hello! We have a paid training period employees must complete at the beginning of their employment. If we decide during training that they are not a good fit for the position, can we rescind the offer or are they a full employee because we have paid them, therefore requiring termination?	
1	We terminated an employee. We had an agreement to pay for a certain number of days depending on who made the decision to separate. We have this arranged to pay him every two weeks until we are done, however, he is asking about a lump sum payment. If we agree to this can we pay this out on a 1099, or would this need to be paid trough payroll and taxed?	
5	An employee was let go last Thursday. We had his final check ready Friday morning. I called him and he said he would come and pick it up. He has not shown up to get it. I have left him several messages reminding him, to no avail. I'm concerned. How should i handle this? I'm tempted to just mail him the check...	
1	I have a California employee who is white male over the age of 40 and we are looking at the possibility that he lied to his managers regarding sales deals we want to terminate based on core value violation. Is there anything in particular that we need to be aware of in California?

4	An employee gave her 2-week notice last Friday, and for a variety of reasons, has not come in to work this week. If we notify her that this is not working and we want to let her go, will that allow her to receive UI benefits?	
5	An employee was terminated for cause last week - falsifying time sheets. He came back inquiring about a bonus he was told he would receive if he completed a project that was outside of his usual job duties.

5	We have an employee who did not come to work three days in a row. We have a no call no show policy, so we sent a letter to him advising that he had been released based on this policy. He called first thing Monday morning stating that he was in a bad way and was going to show up the next day. He showed up to report to work and was told he needed to wait to speak with HR. He walked out at that point stating he quit. He came back later to meet with HR bringing his niece. He had indicated he was an alcoholic and that he was staying with his niece in an alcohol free environment and was going to some counseling sessions. The owner does not want to bring him back. What is the employer's responsibility due to his condition?	
5	An employer called about an employee who used a ss# for enrollment that was not hers. The employee now has working papers and her own ss#. The employer inquired how he should move forward. He doesn't want to fire the employee but understands that she illegally enrolled and that he hired her with false information. He inquired if he should terminate the employee, re-hire her with satisfying the waiting period and enroll her in the group plan with the new ss#. Please advise.	
4	Q2- That team, intake department, Lead intake nurse, and 4 nurses, one of the nurse is really mad at the lead nurse because nothing was done about the complaint. Then they all had a meeting and and everyone was getting mad at the lead nurse. Then the woman who filed initial complaint cussed at the lead stormed out. Now lead is filing a complaint but it may be retaliation. The 3 nurses are ganging up on the lead -don't respect to the lead. A nurse feels the lead is not doing a good job and feels she could do a better job. She's giving a manger a really hard time and told her she didn't think she was doing a good job, that she sucked, etc. And she is talking to other employees about her and they are all saying they want a different manager and they don't respect her. On Friday, one of the other intake nurses was written up and the lead was present. They all talked about it afterwards. The next day, the intake meeting was canceled in favor of another meeting. The nurse causing the problems said "I think we should have the meeting anyway, is that ok" and shut the door. She asked if anyone wanted to start, didn't like feeling tension. The other nurse said I know who has my back and who doesn't. They all agreed they had issues with the lead. The nurses were cussing. Yelling, cussing and said she was going to lose it and walked out and went outside. The lead feels terrible and wants to terminate the one who has been speaking out against her and she filed a grievance. Can we let the nurse go? Would it help to move the nurses around so they're not all in one room? What about moving the lead? What information do you have on bullying under State law?	
5	We have an employee hired 7/3/17. As of 9/12/17 we were worried about his job performance and frequent missing of work as he had already called in sick for 60 hours. He missed work again 9/21 & 9/22, called in sick to a coworker not his boss, against company policy. On 9/25 he texted his manager and said he had missed those days due to back pain associated with an on the job injury on 9/13. This was the 1st time an on the job injury had been reported. We started a workers comp claim 9/25. He did not work at all the week of 9/25 and said he would return to work 10/2. Called in again morning of 10/2 and has not been in contact since. He was already on the bubble due to poor job performance and attendance issues. We also have reason to doubt his claim of being hurt on the job. He dismissed his workers comp claim on his own, which we did not know until the adjuster notified us. Can we terminate him at this point?	
6	We are a construction firm and we have a roofing division. They are commission based. Commission is split up in two checks. 1st check is when roof goes on, and then 2nd is when we receive final payment from the customer. We went to fire a salesman and he is claiming he should be getting all his commission checks, even if we have not received final payment. What are the CO rules regarding commission checks and final payment?	
5	We have an employee that we had to terminate immediately because he admitted to using the company's fed ex or UPS account to send his personal ebay sales. We are wondering if we can deduct the illegal freight charges from his last paycheck? This is in NYC. Thank you.	
1	Greg on the phone as well. We have only been in business for about a month an a half. We have someone who is resigning today. They have been paid on a draw --get paid and pay back when get the commision. how do we deal with the draw? He is willing to give us 2 weeks notice or not?	
5	I called in earlier regarding a termination that will take place today. He is currently at a company event but the termination will take place before he makes a scheduled speaker announcement so we're anticipating questions on where he is. How should we handle such questions from attendees and from our own employee?	
5	We have a bonus that he is due. If we have documentation of where we know he included extra hours on his time sheet, can we deduct that from his bonus? At the time of term, we said why but not that any hours would be deducted. Can we now tell him that he does?	
3	One more question. When employee returns, can I dissolve her position as of 11/1/2017? Sincerely, *Yolanda O'Dell* Practice Administrator Contract and Credentialing Specialist Glendora Radiological Associates, Inc. 414 E. San Bernardino Road Covina, CA 91723	
2	Can you provide a sample separation notice per our discussion?

1	EE in CA who resigned on Friday. We do not want him to work through his notice period.	
1	Via vmail - insuboordination from manage that I want to fire and need some assistance with that. 714/655-4114.	
5	We have a supervisor that gave notice that he was looking to explore a different career elsewhere 6/20/17. At this time, he said he was thinking he would be leaving by September. We were glad for the notice, so we said that was fine. Throughout those next couple months, he showed action of coming and going as he pleased, working half days and such. Our general manager sent him an email 9/25/17 asking for some kind of timeline of when he'd be leaving/his last day. His response was that he didn't know. We have someone ready to step up and take over his supervisor position, so we are wondering what the appropriate action is for us to take to either let me go, give him his last day, push him out, etc.? We had a similar situation where we were notified an employee looking for work elsewhere, but they were not in a high supervisor role, so we were able to be very lenient with him as far as having him stick around. He was also very up front with us and kept us in the loop with his search.	
4	can you direct me on how to handle a letter or email to an employee who took FMLA for her pregnancy, but went out on bed rest sooner unexpectedly. She is to return from her 12 week leave on Monday, October 16th, but I know she is going to want to take more time off with her newborn. We have to fill her position immediately if she does not return on the 16th, and we have a temp there now that we will offer the job to.	
3	If we suspend an employee for three days, when they come back are we able to terminate them right away?	
3	Can the employer offer different severance packages to different employees? Previous employee laid off was with the company with one month severance and pay out of booked commissions up to 4 months; no health insurance. For this employee who has been with the company for 2 years employer is offering one month severance, one month health insurance, and pay out of booked commissions up to 3 months. If one employee of two is laid off what happens to group health insurance plan? Employer's GHI Plan renews on 12.1 How is Cobra handled? Company is an S Corp and owner is an employee. If company goes out of business are there any UI payment obligations beyond the payroll taxes?	
6	If an employee is "Seasonal" and the season ends do we have to pay them on their final day since it is considered voluntary or should they be paid within 48 hrs as involuntary?	
4	Now, the same supervisor wants to terminate another employee (age 60) because the job description of the position has changed and practically her position disappeared. Both employees are very good friends, both working as accountant specialists. 1. She has been only 3 months with the company. Her termination would be related to change in activities and poor performance. Do we have the risk of being sued because of her age again? 2. Can we terminate this employee for closing of the position considering Florida employment is at will?	
1	Greg on the phone as well. We have only been in business for about a month an a half. We have someone who is resigning today. They have been paid on a draw --get paid and pay back when get the commision. how do we deal with the draw? He is willing to give us 2 weeks notice or not?	
3	If an employee gives two weeks notice but the company decides to let the individual go before he has worked the full two weeks, does the company have to pay him for the full two weeks regardless or just up until the last day worked.	
4	Would like to discuss an employee termination. We had an employee hired in June 2014 as outside sales person. Wasn't working out in that role, so we transferred her to in-house bids, PR clients. We have had several meetings to discuss poor performance - with seven documented warnings. Final warning came in August this year. Performance did not improve and management decided to move forward with termination, shortly thereafter, without notice, she found out she had to have surgery. As a good faith gesture, we decided not to pursue termination until she recouped. When she returns from leave in mid-October, we would like to terminate. Is this OK?	
6	We have an employee who quit last night over the phone, can we mail his final check? There arent any check signers in the office today.	
1	We're in Minnesota and we have an employee that is not working out. Can we terminate at-will and not provide a reason?	
3	In need information and training on MA unemployment rules and unemployment insurance.	
1	One of our managers was retrieving something from a client file and discovered two pages of thumbnail photos, which included photos of the clients, other images and two nude photos of one of our employees. This employees interacts a great deal with this client and knows the family outside of work. Our clients are developmentally disabled. Can we immediately proceed with termination?	
3	I'm filling out some unemployment info for an employee that was terminated for cause. I have questions on about the form if someone could help me better understand some of the questions.	
3	Are faith-based organizations exempt from this provision? I just don't want to confuse the employees thinking that they can get unemployment from us. Also - does this provision count for layoffs AND resignations? And can an email with attachments suffice? Thank you.	
5	I was just contacted by an employer who has an employee who left for vacation on September 14th and never returned. The last time they spoke to the employee was September 26th and he said he would be returning September 27th. They have not heard back from this employee yet and have tried contacting him multiple times. In terms of cancelling his insurance, when are they allowed to do so and what steps need to be taken?	
4	Employee situation, We ended up hiring the receptionist who complained about her boss touching her tattoo. Today, she was asked to help the auditor gathering data and told her manager she is stressed. When director of finance walk in the door, she said to him out loud "you suck". Can we get rid of her?	
4	Looking for guidance for issue with a staff member. Staff members were mandated to stay because other staff members had called in sick. She said she wouldn't stay and she would quit if she had to stay. She is pregnant. She left, because she said she could not work another 8 hours. She had worked the fewest hours a week, 2 staff were mandated. The other staff stayed. She's now saying that she did not intend to quit that just did not want to work the additional time because she'd pregnant. We have received no limitation requests from her. Stays are a requirement of the position. The manager wants to accept her resignation.	
4	Hello - If we have an hourly employee who gives her two weeks notice (works 6 hours a day). Can we ask her to leave without paying her or would we have to pay her out assuming she is working 6 hours a day. Thanks, Chad	
4	We have a current employee who is a property manager. She has been employed for 2 years with us. She is on intermittent FMLA. She has issues where she has been in and out of the hospital for various amount of time off. Initially never declared as FMLA. She was gone in March for 2 weeks. We provided FMLA then and if she was gone and out a few days we applied that time to the FMLA. She advised she needs dialysis, but stated that she he can still work while getting her dialysis. We received a doctor's release for her to work during dialysis. The issue is that she is not keeping up with her work. She is missing deadlines and it is affecting her relationship with clients and coworkers. We are getting emails from others stating that she has not been responding, and she lied to the CEO about having completed something she didn't do. We wnat to terminate due to her performance and work issues.	
4	Employee in GA gave two weeks notice. She has been very nasty and the manager wants to let her go today (she has one week left). We are at-will but our handbook asks employees to give 2-week notice. Do we have to pay her for the week left in her notice or no?policy says "we ask that you provide your supervisor with at least two week's notice" it does not say the word required, so I think I'm okay if they let her go today.	
5	Hired a guy, not long ago, he came to work for one day then disappeared and we have not able to reach him. Eventually, we processed a job abandonment termination. The paycheck we issued was mailed to the address he provided on his I-9, but it was returned as an insufficient address. What do we do?	
5	We had an employee who received an electrical shock while changing a light bulb in the store, and the manager sent him home. He said he did not need to see a doctor, but he came in the next day with a doctor bill b/c he'd been to the ER and had a co-pay. The manager said we'd pay for it. The manager did not pass any of this information along to me, and the bill was not paid. I then discovered the employee smoking a vape in the store, and this was not the first time he'd been doing this. When I asked the manage why he had not been written up I was told it was because of all these other incidents. I have let the manager know how to better handle things in the future and we will let the issue with employee vaping in the store the first time go. but he had to be written up for the second incident. When the manger when to write up the employee, he resigned. He had not come in today. We will pay him medical bill, and of course all monies owed, but what else should we do about this situation?	
5	We plan on terminating an employee. He took a car home and got into a car accident. We found out through police reports but he has not said anything to us. We want to terminate today but will not have his final check until tomorrow, then do an investigation. Can we overnight his last check?	
3	I have an employee who is on medical leave since June 2017 and She passed away last Sept 20 2017. Aside from the Sunlife Disability and Accident life coverage that i have to notify, do I have to notify other government agencies such as EDD.	
4	During the time we were issuing a corrective action to an employee, she got upset, refused to sign the corrective action, stated she didn't need this "S@#$" and said she quit as she walked off the job site. We followed up with an email that next day stating we accepted her resignation and asked to schedule a time for her to come to the location to pick up her belongings. We have not received a response from her, but then learned that she has been arriving late at night when no management is present to visit our residents. Not wanting to resort to utilizing law enforcement, what can we do to prevent this employee from entering the facility?	
2	Thank you for the help in this matter. One clarification question, does the Registration Acknowledgement Letter go to the employee as well as the employee file or just into the employee file? Brightest regards, Brooke Nutting Owner Virus-free.	
4	An employee in Berkeley gave notice to her employer and said her last day would be tomorrow. She came in today and the employer said thanks but we're letting you go today and paid her for half a day today. Can you tell me: Can they do that or are they required to pay her through tomorrow? What is the current minimum wage in Berkeley?	
1	Someone resigned, do we have to include all the forms that were attached. EDD, CA separation packet Or just the initial termination letter? What do we do with the attachments? Do we fill them out?	
5	We had a non-union fail a drug test and we will be terminating him tomorrow via certified letter (he was suspended pending investigation). do you have an example letter I could use to terminate the individual?	
5	I approached the employee we want to terminate. He confessed to having taken the car, damaging it and acknowledged he was required to notify us of the incident. I told him I will be evaluating continued employment and we had him return all company property. Can I do the termination by phone and email the state-required termination forms? Can I overnight the check or because he's my neighbor hand it to him the day of the termination without him returning to the work site?	
1	We are terminating an employee in California today. I know we need to pay out his salary today, but he also earns commision. Our next commission payment is not until the 15th of this month. Do we have to pay the commission today or can we wait until the 15th?	
3	can an employee file for unemployment is the employee is on a leave of absence?	
1	Employee was a PRN, and has not been communicating about wanting to stay on. After six months, we sent an email asking him to respond by a certain date or we will assume voluntary resignation. What do I put on the DOL 800 notice?	
4	Follow up regarding an employee who has been having performance issues along with absenteeism issues. She has provided doctor's notes for her absences. Most recently she closed the shop up early and left, and then left again the following day without advising anyone. Would this be enough to terminate?	
0	Our vacation policy allows an employee to have 15 days of vacation for the year. All 15 days are available to the employee beginning at the start of the calendar year. My question is if an employee quits in September and hasn't used any of the vacation days how many days would we be required to pay out as the state law requires us to pay out accrued unused vacation? Would it be all 15 days since they were all available to him to use since the start of the year or just 11.25 days since he only worked 9 months of the year?	
5	An employee who is on FMLA leave gave us his resignation today. He stated that he has mailed back his company property. Can we hold his final paycheck until we get his property back? He is union - our union contract allows pay out of 1/2 of sick leave, and a severance. Can we hold those wages until receipt of company property?	
4	An employee abandoned her job so we are processing her resignation. She reached out to us an asked that only a specific employee pack up her things. Are we required to honor that?	
5	We have an employee whose last day is today. He has his entire family on the group health plan, and we would cover him for the entire month. Can we double up on deductions?	
5	We let someone go this morning and we believe the guy was emotionally unstable. Now texting other employees saying he is going to kill himself. He is insinuating he was going to harm himself "maybe its time to go."	
4	We have an employee in one of our stores who is afraid to close the store at night alone. She refuses to do it and we do not have many employees at the store to cover for her every time. The store is not making enough money to make it work to have two people there every night. Since she cannot perform the duties of the job, are we in the clear to terminate? Thank you.	
6	We are terminating an employee who is located in Northern California. We know that we have to get him his final check on the date that he is terminated, does that included processing time?	
2	We are terminating an employee in NE and I have some questions about how to handle a long distance termination. meeting pay severance forms (including COBRA)	
4	Regarding terminating a manager of our company for breaching company policy. Larry, our CFO, is on the line too. The manager handles our IT and is not communicating to employees. She is hostile and disruptive to the management team. She works from home two days a week, but changes those days randomly, and nobody knows when she will be here. We have a zero tolerance for drugs or alcohol in the workplace, and employees are saying she drinks at lunch and comes back slurring and stammering. I even saw her myself, sitting at a restaurant with two other employees during lunch, drinking alcohol.	
5	We have an older employee that is at retirement age and his performance is steadily declining (slow work and makes mistakes). The employee has stated he senses that work is slowing down, and if we want to get rid of him, we can, because he is eligible for retirement. Ultimately, we would be OK with letting him go, but we would like to avoid an involuntary termination and don't want to risk discrimination. How would you advise we approach this? The supervisor would like to have a conversation with the employee today.	
3	I have an employee who did not show up for work and has not responded to text messages, etc. She was only employed for 45 Days. Is there anything I need to do? Job abandonment?	
4	In regards to figuring out an employees last payroll check. Making sure I have done everything. The school pays on accrual salary. The contract states any proration for final pay is factored on number of school days - 185 days. She worked 39 of those days. I'm taking the factor of 39/185 and dividing that into her total contract amount of $7,770. Then, I took the amount she was paid for the contracted days she worked, and compared that to the factored proration and paid her the difference. Assuming I'm only looking the contracted days because I paid her for those non/contracted days she worked. I don't believe they should be considered into the final pay. What if she had a benefit premium due for October? Would I prorate that into the final pay or take the full monthly premium?	
2	Can you send any required forms for a California termination and final pay information.	
0	We have a question regarding a dependent care FSA and COBRA continuation. If the employee wants to accelerate the deduction in advance of leaving, and we are going to have a check for wages and a check for vacation payout, can we deduct from the vacation payout?	
5	Hello, We have an employee that has not reported to work for about a week. We did send out a abandonment letter, which expired a day before he came back to work. We have found out that the employee was incarcerated for a misdemeanor, but that is the only info that we have. He works as a forklift driver. Are we okay to terminate him based on the fact the he was incarcerated with a misdemeanor? If not, could we ask for more details on charges he was held and also ask for documentation? Or would the abandonment letter be sufficient to terminate him? Thank you.	
4	I have a client who terminated an employee. She is insisting she is to get paid her PTO and Vacation and states that it is state law she is paid these. The client does NOT have anything written in her handbook regarding this. Does she legally have to pay her these benefit hours?	
2	Follow up to previous issue from today. I cannot open the link to the termination documents. Can you help me?	
6	An employee gave notice last week and today he walked off the job. What do I need to do? Can we direct deposit final wages? So I will text the employee and ask for authorization to mail or direct deposit the last check,or pick-up and get response. Next, call bookkeeper and have a check cut. How much time do I have to get the final pay? I can have a check ready Monday.	
5	Employee who is asking to be laid off so he can get unemployment. He went into surgery before workers' comp approved it - WC is denying the surgery payment. Do we have that option?	
5	We have an employee in a protected class and he turned in his two week resignation. We have had performance issues with him and we had done corrective action. He went on a break today and did not return. We tried calling him and he didn't respond. He told another employee he didn't want to come back and he was also three hours late to work today. Can we just let him go instead? We do not have a contract with him.	
6	Sorry it is for the final check and can we deduct negative PTO?	
4	We have ongoing performance problems with an employee. She's a very emotional person and seems to get stressed out very easily. She manages a few people but for the job, seems unstable. She has been warned and counseled on performance so the termination will not be a surprise to her. Do you think there would be liability with allowing her the option to resign? Also, before going on vacation, she made a comment to her boss that she doesn't know if she can do the job any longer.	
6	An employee gave notice on Monday that his last day of work would be Friday. Do I need to have his check ready on Friday?	
3	Our company employs "as needed" PRN employees. They can go a few weeks without any hours and without any pay, etc. My question is: this type of employee resigned/was dismissed: what should the term date be documented as? Their last day they actually worked or the day they were dismissed/turned in their resignation? THANKS	
2	California employee passed away and best practices on the situation.	
3	Two employees got in a physical fight yesterday. Today I spoke to each and got their side of the story. One seems more forthcoming with the details than the other. They know we have a surveillance camera though. So they're currently suspended until we finish the investigation. I wanted to know your thoughts on grounds for termination.	
0	New client just come on, Barrasso Excavation. They just recently let go some people, one disgruntled about PTO time. Please call Desiree - 610 401-0588 desiree@barrassoexcavation.com Handbook states - PTO, you must give notice to take, we give two weeks, use-or-lose-it, renews Jan 1st, after 1 year they get 1week, then one extra day after each year until they get to two weeks. There is no carry over. If resign, remaining PTO will not be taken or paid out in any circumstance. Under certain circumstances Barrasco may provide for payout. We paid some of it prorated based on the amount of time worked this year. One guy wants the full two weeks of PTO paid and says he will see us in court. What does the law say about paying out PTO upon termination.	
1	A background was sent to us 'incorrectly' but they do not have the authority to tell us what was incorrect.The letter advised that we are to return the report they originally issued and they will send us the correct one. Do we have any responsibility to this employee to reconsider his employment? The position has been filled and we followed protocol with him. We provided 10 business days from the date of the pre-adverse notice for him to provide corrected information however this notice was received after that period. During the 10 days he never contacted us.	
3	Metric Machining | Exempt-Non Exempt Inquiry Good morning- We had an exempt employee request to go on a temporary six month part-time schedule, initially to help the financial position of the company, and then stated for medical reasons. We have treated this as an ADA Accommodation. Although the initial request came directly from the employee to have a reduction in hours, Senior management is enforcing the reduction of hours (outside of the medical accommodations) due to current financial position and having to cut overhead expenses. Based on this situation, is the employee entitled to partial unemployment and / or state disability benefits?? Employee was Exempt on a 4/10's schedule, now Non-Exempt working 2/8's schedule. Employee initially requested to be on a 2/10's schedule; however, Senior management denied request as to not pay 4 hours of overtime per week. Please note, we are on a state approved Alternative Work Schedule of 4/10's. Your prompt attention is greatly appreciated. M.

4	Thursday we terminated an employee for cause after 40 days other issues she put in claim against super at one point termed because she was on a call for 50 mins with patient in which the employee and patient talked about the employee's bf, relationship advice, plans to call patient every Friday for relationship advice and being on news for killing boyfriend and hurdle of accepting homosexual and transgender people. calls are supposed to be 5-10 mins. Call was inappropriate, went on far too long. The employee emailed us because she wants the discipline investigation and wants to talk to a lawyer. And she also asked for the phone call. Its our property. The supervisor was not involved into the termination. The complaint was "hostile work environment" and "harassment" the supervisor was nit picky/abrasive according to her. We told the employee we would address the supervisor and would not disclose the disciplinary action to her because it was confidential and we asked the employee and supervisor to start fresh. We issued a verbal warning to the supervisor. She felt the supervisor should have been terminated or suspended.	
0	I am out of NY. PTO we accrue over the course of a year. Let's say I am new to the company and I take some time off and I have not accrued all of that time and then I quit two months later is that something that the company is allowed to deduct on the employee's final paycheck?	
3	We are terminating an employee and they don't have insurance; they don't need the COBRA information correct? Do they still need the HIPP Notice?	
4	I have a group that hired an employee and they showed up one day and haven't showed up again. She had been asking for additional money because she got another job offer. She left them a long message saying she got another job offer for more money. They have been asking her to come in, but she has not responded. They are not going to offer her more money. They want to know if they can terminate her over the phone and/or voicemail if she does not answer.	
1	We hired an employee about 4 months ago for an HR Assistant role. However, business has slowed down drastically and we are not able to provide this individual with enough work to keep them busy. Do we have to keep this employee on staff? If we let the individual go for the reason of lack of work, what are the risks?	
3	When an employee leaves a company, are they obligated to tell their employer the name of the company they are moving to?	
5	About an employee who has essentially resigned. We accepted the resignation and told him so. He said he does not want it to be a resignation, and I am wondering how to respond to that. I have the email correspondence from employee if you would like to see it.	
4	We have an employee that has been on board for a period of five (5) weeks. She has had very poor attendance due to personal illness and/or child care issues. She just informed her manager she is also pregnant. We are looking to terminate, however we are concerned due to her sharing her pregnancy with her manager. May be proceed in termination?	
2	If I fire someone in a PEO environment do I have to enter the termination in the system after I conduct the termination?	
6	We recently terminated an employee. What do we need to do to be compliant? The employee resigned - when is final pay due? If the employee overspent vacation, can it be deducted from final pay? The employee was on benefits. Can you provide the paperwork for that? 25 employees in the organization.	
3	I was told by lawyers both yes and no: When they do a settle and release for workers' comp is just for workers' comp or employment as well?	
3	If an employee is resigning and states it is due to medical reasons should an employer engage in the interactive process to comply with ADA and FEHA rules? What if the employee resigned on the spot before HR could talk to them and you cant reach them via phone or email, should the employer sent a letter post termination explaining the different leave options, to ensure proper documentation? Please advise.	
5	We have an employee that is a driver and he has been involved in two accidents, one 30 days ago and one last Friday. When the manager reported this to the safety department they stated he would have to be removed from insurance. They were preparing to terminate him on Monday and he came in on Tuesday and stated that he had some particles in his eye and filed a worker's compensation claim. He came back today, he is part-time, with updates stating he is released to work with restriction of wearing protective glasses. Can we terminate him at this time or should we wait until he is released to full duty?	
2	Supplemental information concerning Reduction in Force/Terminations.	
4	We recently had a position elimination. We have since received an email from the former employee advising that she feels she was not paid out appropriately, and that she is seeking the advice of legal counsel. She feels she was not properly paid out for her bonuses as well as for her vacation. What is the employer's possible exposure here?	
2	Hi, Would you have a template letter for a termination without cause for an employment-at-will? This is for the State of Colorado. Thank you.	
1	We have an employee in Wisconsin (works from home), and we have a contract ending for his services at the end of June.....is there anything specific we need to do in terms of advance notice prior to potential termination? We are considering him for other opportunities within our company, but they are more advanced skillsets. We're trying to help him learn what is needed, but if he doesn't gain those skills, we'll have to let him go. Any advice as to how to handle or what to do in specifics to WI state would be a help.

5	Mark and Justin, Northwest Passage provides guidance for troubled adolescence, 100 employees, in Wisconsin. Two founding fathers of the non-profit organization, have been working on transitioning out for a year. During the last few months both founding fathers submitted separation package requests and the board accepted them. One of the founders is more cooperative than the other. We had our attorney draw up the agreements and we sent them back to the founders. We received questions from both. One was minor questions, the other is being more difficult, dragging his feet and sees this as forced retirement. What might be the trap doors? He is meeting with legal counsel the first part of May. He seems to be back peddling on the severance he requested. How does it work if we say take it or leave it? The positions are being eliminated. If he back tracks and submits something else, can we move forward anyway? He says that he understands that once you are over 50 you are supposed to receive $44k a year for life. Have you heard of this?	
6	Follow up on previous issue: We are unable to retract the employee's direct deposit to issue his final wages as a live check. How should we manage? No accrued PTO, so no pay out due. The employee has not returned company property as requested, manager wants to go to his home to receive those assets. I dont think that should occur. How do I explain to the manager that is a bad idea?	
3	When a CA employee terminates and is due future commissions that are at the point of termination yet unpaid by the client, when are those due to the terminated employee?	
6	Can we deduct an employee for not returning a key?	
5	We had an employee who was let go yesterday (not performing well). He had a disability, he was a consultant. His mobility was restricted. He needed a special chair we offered to provide and he wanted to purchase it on his own so he could keep it. He is asking us to ship it to him - do we have to, legally. He paid for it to be delivered. I am not sure it could be moved - it requires assistance moving it.	
2	We have an office in San Ramon, Ca and we are going to lay off one person. I wanted to make sure I know the laws. Can you send me termination paperwork for California?	
1	Caller Mark Wiseman. We have an employee that performs scheduling services remotely. We want to process separation and inquiry if we can call this elimination of position. He is the only employee working in the capacity remotely and we will only retain this position in our headquarters. This is a problematic employee with on-going performance and person issues. If we separate, should we offer severance?	
4	An employee's position was eliminated - I called yesterday - can I walk through it with you? We will have counsel look at it as well. Can we discuss from a general HR standpoint? Should I include that she was short of her meeting threshold goal. She had a bonus potential. Its clearly stated in the letter she signed. We are attaching this and asking for any additional information, if she has it. We locked her out of her email. Are there legal issues with revoking her access? The bonus was issued in January. We offered to allow her to leave her LinkedIn as RealClearPolitics and to provide a reference in writing, can we revoke that?	
1	We are going through our corporate forms for terminations/resignations. We dont have a form for exit interviews. We are in the construction industry. We just want to talk about exit interviews, get some information and perhaps some sample exit interview forms.	
0	Hello, I am trying to find out what states require companies to provide a service letter (termination letter). Do we need to provide it upon request or when terminating an employee? Also, is there anything else that a service letter needs to include based on the state law. I am focusing only on the states we have employees in: IL, TX, CA, KS, TN, CO. How do we treat employees that live/ work in different state, for example IN. We have employees that work in IL but reside in IN. Which state law do we have to follow - worked in or lived in state? Another question, if employees accrue vacation from hire date, but are unable to use it until three months after their hire date, upon termination, do we have to pay out for any vacation accrued, but not available for use? Is there any specific state laws?	
5	We have a California employee whose gone missing. He is not returning phone call and currently have company equipment and proprietary information that he has not returned. Can we withhold his final check until he returns the equipment?	
1	We have an employee who is terminating tomorrow. We are based in Florida, but the employee is in California. We need to confirm when the final pay is due to him. We also want to confirm any termination paperwork that we must provide.	
1	We need to restructure our company. As such, several positions, both exempt and not exempt will be eliminated. This only affects 8 employees, half are over 40, and it is a diverse group. The attorney blessed the severance agreements. Any advice on how to inform the employees affected by this change. It really is financially driven as non of the employees have performance issues. We are cutting "nice to have" positions that don't really generate income to the company.	
5	I'm doing a termination for poor work performance and violating company policy. He was inside the powder coding booth texting. We have a policy banning use of cell phones and he was on paid time. Is this "violating company policies?" That is what I have checked.	
2	We are doing a reduction in force on Monday. Letting about 16 people go. I was wondering if you had a generic letter that I could give them. Do I have to send them a letter? What are best practices for this?	
4	I went on the ThinkHR site and California Department of Labor. An employee failed to return from FMLA and failed to communicate. She was expected to return today and she did not. She was also past due in keeping her premiums current. We are not allowed on the final paycheck even though she agreed in writing.	
6	I just wanted to double check the final pay check does not have to be an actual physical check, it can be direct deposit; is that correct? In Illinois	
5	We have an employee in Pennsylvania that is under his 90 days and it is not working out. We have spoken to him about his performance and documented it. Can we terminate him? What if this person has been out excessively and they had surgery and have not had enough time to grasp the job?	
0	An employee walked off the job on April 11 and has not returned. She is now demanding that we pay her accrued vacation and sick. We do not have a policy of paying accrued vacation and sick at time of separation, and our practice has been to only pay it when the employee provides appropriate advance notice. Must we pay this out to her? When is her final check due? She is angry because her final check was not direct deposited. We always issue live checks as final checks. Is that okay?	
2	I need the required termination forms for IL, FL, NY, and TX.	
3	If an terminated associates requests a copy of their noncompete. How long does the company have to give them the copy? Are there any time frames?	
1	We have new EE out sick and just started a couple of weeks ago.	
1	I have an account manager who has been with us about 10 months. I have had many conversations about performance expectations and specific errors she continues to make. I am at the point where I think termination is appropriate but just need to talk it through.	
4	I have an employee who has was hired 8 weeks ago who has missed a lot of work already. She has had a reason for each instance, but it is not a promising trend given how new she is and dependability is very important for her job role. Last week she informed us she is pregnant and then missed work the following 4 days and is still out. We believe it is best we part ways while still in this 90-day probationary period, however, we want to know if there are now any complications with terminating her given she informed us of her pregnancy?	
4	Recently hired a female manager for the salon. She is pregnant, and lives 45 minutes. Calling in sick, of five shifts she has called off on four of them, can we let her go - what should we consider?	
4	We are licensed by state of Illinois. Educational requirements changed and we verbally notified this employee of this change over 2 years. Without the associates degree she needs to maintain her position, we can't allow her to work in this role any longer and we have no other position she can fill. Would it be risky to terminate? Also, our board of directors is concerned about the unemployment claim. Do you think she would be awarded benefits?	
4	Kimberly Kelllerman on behalf of Suzanne. An employee was being led in to a conference room today to be terminated due to frequent tardiness and poor performance. She came to work late today and as her supervisor was leading her down to the conference room, she knew what was happening, and she turned around and walked out the building. How should we manage?	
4	An employee who has only been with us about 6 weeks has missed work a few times. What is pushing us to consider termination, is that she requested a day off on Friday for today, Monday to take her mom to the hospital. Her request was denied stating too many employees' requests had been approved. She stated it was for her mom's emergency biopsy surgery. She called off today and the manager wants to terminate. What are your thoughts?	
1	In MD, are we required to give an employee a reason to let go. I was told that because MD is Employment At Will we don't have to give her a reason. Employee filled out application, but the background check shows recent a conviction of 4th degree theft. Unfortunately, the application is misplaced. We don't know what she put on the application, but are concerned about the theft conviction because we have had problems with employees stealing from customer cars.	
5	via email: One of our clients had a physical alternative occur in the workplace today. See below and attached for details. What is the appropriate response to this? "We had a physical altercation between a couple of employees today. It happened between two employees that have never got along and have had previous arguments and screaming matches in the past. Their names are Mark Walker and Cody Owsley. Apparently Cody needed clarification on some specs on a mixer and for that information, he needs to go to Mark. After a few words Mark grabbed Cody by the back of the neck, pushed his head down and held him for several seconds. He then stood up and threatened to push him out of his office. Not long after the altercation, Mark announced he was taking the rest of the day off. I told him to bring me a written report of what happened. Cody also wrote up what happened and he had red marks on the back of his neck. I've attached a picture. My initial reaction is to fire Mark. No physical aggression is acceptable. What action should I take? Would firing Mark open me up to liability? "	
4	Payroll period. Paid on 13th, last day of pay period is 7th. WE are terminating her today 10/9. Would we need to pay her the check she would have received on Friday, today?	
5	We have an employee who has had a lot of absence issues or he is coming in tardy (unplanned). His manager did a verbal warning two weeks ago and his manager is requiring a call instead of a group Slack. He did the Slacks twice again last week. Today he sent a message on the Slack channel again and we had reached out to meet with him. We were planning to terminate today but he is not here, again. He is not saying why he has been out. How should we handle it at this point? What happens if he doesn't show? Friday he no called, no showed. Today he sent a message on the slack channel.	
1	We are going to furlough an employee. what do I need for that?	
4	New employee - 30 days 8/22 She has had a 17 absences. grandfather passed away, funeral, sick, bad news from doctor and was going to be late but never showed up. Said victim of domestic violence but then later said it was not domestic violence. She was a no show on Thursday, called in absent on Friday and today is a no show no call. We are thinking of termination.	
0	We have several offices in Texas and a couple in Louisiana. Our Louisiana offices have approximately 100 employees in Louisiana. Our corporate PTO policy and employee handbook states that PTO (we do not have vacation of sick leave specific) payout of accrued/unused hours is forfeited if employee is terminated for cause or if employee fails to provide adequate notice. Are there state laws in Louisiana that supersede our policy? I have seen publications that say yes, but it's always when there is a clear defined line between PTO, vacation and sick leave.	
2	I am looking for information regarding temporary layoff in South Carolina. What would be the impact for the employer and the affected employees?	
6	May an employer deduct the cost of an expense reimbursement owed back from the employee to the employer on the employee's final paycheck?

3	Is it legal to terminate employee if has open workman's comp claim in the state of Oklahoma?	
3	My question is regarding company property. We have a consultant who has not returned their laptop and is not being highly responsive to us. What recourse can we take? They are in CA	
1	If an employee voluntary quits and gives us a three week notice- Can we terminate him in two weeks? If we do so, are we required to pay him through the extended date in his notice? Thank you.	
3	HR perspective - the company wants to let go an employee and offer severance. They thought it would benefit the employee by paying the severance on a 1099 so that it would not have taxes withheld. I think it would cause a classification issue if they did that and am looking for some back up.	
3	When an employee terminates in California, are we required to give them something in writing that confirms their last day of benefits coverage such as their health coverage and life insurance coverage?	
2	A department in our company wants to terminate an employee. I dont believe the letter written (read to ThinkHR) has enough to substantiate a termination. Can you provide advice?	
5	Production manager wants to terminate someone. His assistant is dating one of the workers. If the worker gets off early, he goes back in and disrupts the assistant while she is still on the clock. They have been warned to keep things professional at work. On Friday afternoon, one of the supervisors observed them kissing at her desk. The production manager reviewed the video from the camera found 30 min of inappropriate behavior. He wants to fire the assistant, and I'm concerned that could be discrimination or possibly taking this too far.	
4	We had a health and wellness director at one of our locations. We decided to eliminate the position. Laid her off on Friday. There was also an element of not being a team player so we would not want to re-hire her. Now the coordinator is not willing to step up and take over her responsibilities. She works part time. We are trying to determine the legalities if we were to open up a new position to take on some of her old responsibilities. What are the best practices for opening a new position? What if she applies? Financially we can not afford a director and it is not needed at this time. We wanted to open up a coordinator position.	
4	We've had an employee out on unpaid personal leave (not eligible for FMLA due to tenure) and we allowed her to take unpaid leave to have her baby. She was told she could she return 4 weeks after delivery - we communicated that to her and asked her to come back in 4 weeks. She was supposed to return today and she has not talked to any one of us at this time. The manager wants to to terminate the employee. No one has reached out to her. I think the right thing to do is reach out to her? Her one is in May. She's in Texas. We haven't seen anything from her doctor. We provided her notice by email... The manager let her work from home until we talked to her (that this process should go through HR) and the manager took the accommodation away. We reinstated the accommodation. No one has heard from her. She emailed back that she got our message.	
5	We have an employee who we hired for warehouse or driver position. He was already hired for a week before receiving the pre-employment drug testing and background check back. His drug test results were questionable and there appears to be issues with his license and insurance. What is our option to now terminate his employment?	
6	An employer is processing a final paycheck for an employee in MN. Can they deduct the full month's employee premium from the final paycheck?	
6	Can we deduct costs for damages to a third party vehicle that the employee caused on the day of termination from the employee's last check?	
2	National Writing Project Can you provide a sample termination/layoff letter that I can use that includes information on how to file for unemployment?

1	We have a former employee that was terminated due to poor job performance. We have been contacted by a company asking for a reference. What are we allowed to say?	
4	We have stylist who gave her notice yesterday as I'm done. She walked out. We have in policy that if you out walk out on a shift and don't give your 2 week notice, then pay is reduced to $8 an hour. Is that legal? She signed the handbook.	
5	We have an employee who was working at a jobsite and sent vulgar text messages to an employee of the company we were doing work for. We have a zero tolerance sexual harassment policy however when confronted, he stated he had an issue with alcohol and wanted to seek treatment. We feel he should be terminated due to the lengthy text message which was clearly sexual harassment . Can we terminate if his argument was that he was so drunk that he doesn't remember doing it (the text messages started at 4pm on a Monday right after he got out of work). We can't prove whether or not he was drunk as no one saw him.

5	VM 2:31pm We have an employee wanting to take Paid Family Leave in November, but this is an employee who we have discussed in the past being laid off. This is something my boss has been thinking about for a while, more the last couple of weeks and they are finishing up a project. He feels the employee is not up to par where he should be. The employee just submitted a request to take off for PFL. He just had a baby earlier this summer and wants to take the 6 weeks. He's going to be gone 11/13 through January 1. This would deplete his vacation. How would that work? My boss feels we can't let him go, do we let him go in January? We have 35 employees. I'm not sure how the manager wants to treat the separation - I am thinking it would be a layoff. If my boss wants to let him go before he leaves, we can do it?	
6	I forgot to ask the question about final pay for the individual whose work authorization has expired. Would we still have to provide the employee with his final check today?	
2	We are going to ask one of our executives to resign. Can you help me prepare a letter of recommendation for him?

4	Peter with Marsh on line as well. Employment law with respect to termination of employees. Our assistant supervisor left in the middle of the shift after caused a scene, shouted "I quit" and left. Her behavior was erratic. We left her a VM when she left communicating she was being placed on suspension. Upon investigating we found out she got physical on the way out the door, shoving another manager which was completely unnecessary. We left her a VM yesterday communicating we want to talk with her. When we did not hear back from her by the end of the day the manager called her again last night and left a message that we are accepting her resignation. The manager didnt realize she had apparently left him a voice message at 3 pm yesterday stating I've gone to my doctor, and will be going on disability for nervous breakdown. She is calling in today wanting to know why we arent letting her go on disability. We are thinking that her termination will be dated as of yesterday.	
2	I have an employee who quit on the spot. They will not provide a resignation letter. Should I send a letter saying if they do not provide a resignation letter it will be a termination for cause?	
4	We have provided a number of written and verbal warnings, including performance improvement plans, but the staff member continues doing things she has been asked not to, and not getting along with staff. We are planning on terminating her, can we give her the option to resign? And in the termination letter do we have to list the most recent examples of her issues, or can we just say "continued non compliance with previous requests"?	
1	We're terminating an employee at-will in California. Is there anything we need to consider that's specific to the state?	
5	Employee gave two week notice with a last day of 10/20. He is a disaster right now, has an attitude, asking other employees to quit. He is being the opposite of helpful. If we fire him today, would he be eligible for UI? Alternately, can we pay him through his last day (10/21) and ask him not to come in? Would he be eligible for UI if we did this?	
6	If an employee voluntarily resigns, and we let them go the same day they resign, but pay them up to their resignation date (technically still employed, but not contributing to the business - sent home). Do we have to pay final wages on the date we notify them or on their resignation date?

3	A client had an employee walk off the job without notice. The employee is a cook and they simply left food cooking on the stove, didn't notify anyone and simply left the premises. This happened on September 29th. The employer tried to reach out the employee several times on the 29th and 30th and never heard back from him. The employer doesnt have a written policy regarding job abandonment in these situations but they are trying to determine whether they can make the termination date September 29th and terminate benefits as of September 30th (the policy normally goes through the end of the month). How should they proceed?	
3	If someone walks off the job during a middle of the shift on 9/30, can the employer cancel their medical coverage for October? No job abandonment policy in place. No information on whether the company communicated with the employee or if the employee reached out the the company. No idea on why the employee left the job either.	
5	Hi, we had an employee (delivery and pickup driver) get in a car accident last month. We filed a Workers Comp claim with our workers comp insurance company. He went to treat his minor injuries, followed up with some phyiscal therapy and was discharged by them to return to work 100% like before, just after 1 week. He hasn't been the same since his injury these days, stating he has PTSD and also started going to a chiropractor on his own. Today he came to me and said his dr. told him he is 100% unable to work based on his assessment of his condition. He has advised us that his last day will be in 3 days. I am now preparing for the worst ie. 1. Reopened WC claim along with "lifelong" injuries per the chiro and 2. Unemployment claims. We have a standard template exit interview form, one question which asks "Separation Reason", but anything else in particular I should request upon his last day? Do you have a better exit interview template that would protect us as much as possible? Thanks He seemed adamant about leaving, I brought up leave to him. Its too bad, he was a good employee.

2	Our typical pay through for commission paid employees who leave us whether voluntary or not is to pay commission on delivered sales for the current pay period, plus the next two pay periods. This is generally 4-6 of runoff pay for sales that were written while actively employed. One of our commission paid employees was killed in an auto accident last Friday, Jan 20. My intent is to continue processing pay into his direct deposit account through our usual pay upon termination arrangement. Can you think of any reason that we would handle this differently? Ill be speaking with his beneficiaries later today or tomorrow, and will confirm the bank account remains open for depositing pay through the March 3rd date that would be routine practice. Our Response: Based on our research we find no limit on wages provided under NC wage payment or probate laws therefore the employer should follow their policy and practice for wages and earned commissions.

1	If a supervisor wants to terminate an employee, in the state of Missouri, are we allowed to do so without any written documents and written out "proof" as to why we are terminating the employee, even if we have a legitimate reason for termination? This employee has had previous "counseling" with supervisors and owners on issues we are experiencing.	
4	We have an employee who has provided us sick notes through a psychologist since early December. Each week she gives her manager a new note pulling her off work. She stated she is on state disability, but we have not received any such paperwork. She then sent us a "picture" of her benefits she is paid, but it is not through Flooring Liquidators. We would like to terminate her due to having ZERO coverage for that store and need a replacement. In addition, we have a base medical plan we pay 100% for employee only portion and then we offer buy-up options, she has elected the buy-up option, since she has not worked to generate income, we have been paying the premium for the medical plan, she is due a commission check that will not even cover the difference she is supposed to be paying. May we deduct the medical premium from her commission check and remove her effective 1/1/17 for not being an actively working employee? Our handbook states there is NO medical coverage during a leave.

1	Historically when paying severance to employees, we've always paid 1 week per year they've worked at the company. Is that negotiable, or if you have an employee with 30 years with the company, can we pay them less severance and tell them we now cap tenure at 20 years?	
2	Termination due to performance - should we note that brevity on the term letter or provide more details?	
3	I am looking for information on what is required documents for new hires in FL. Also, are there any requirements for terminating employees? My understanding is that you can pay them their last check in their normal pay cycle and that you don't have to pay out any PTO on the books. I also heard something about paying them at minimum wage if they don't return their property??	
1	Should we get written resignation from an employee?	
5	We have a manager who over the past year became very ineffective as a manager. He began to cease to managing his employees. He would come and go from work and just go his projects, but not manager his staff. His team was declining. After coaching and working with him, we demoted him to a developer. We ended up promoting someone from his staff to manager. We allowed him to work from home from home since this all happened. We thought this would make the transition easier and he had projects to focus on. Since he's been working from home as a developer it is clear that his skill set is not where it needs to be for our organization.

1	We discovered a manager was fraudulently modifying his employees time records to make his labor costs look better. We fixed the employee records and will be providing the back pay today. We decided to terminate the manager and want to make sure we process the exit correctly.	
3	My question is if somebody quits, is there any scenario where they eligible for unemployment? Where they feel that the working conditions are so bad that the only option is to quit. They weren't fired, there was no fraud or anything, it was voluntary.	
2	What do you do if you have an employee that is trying to get fired to collect unemployment?	
5	We have an employee in his probationary period who we want to terminate. We have not provided him with a verbal warning and we want to make sure that we are okay with proceeding with the termination. We have a progressive disciplinary process, but we did not follow it with this employee, because he was in his probationary period. He was also not provided with a copy of the employee manual.	
1	I have a question about terminating an existing employee who has been here for two years and has not been very productive. We would like to phase out his position.	
6	I need to determine the final pay amount for an employee.	
4	We hired a new agent about 2 weeks ago. SInce then, we have had about 4 employee complaints about how she communicates to others. She is rude, uses foul language and tries to intimidate others. Her direct supervisor has spoken to her on this, without success. We would like to terminate. What reason can we use, and what are the risks? We have documented the various incidences that have occurred and her supervisor's discussion with her.

3	Hello there, I had a question. Two of my employees were coming back from an event when they stopped for coffee. When they did that they left the sales in the truck which was stolen. My questions are: Can I discipline or terminate them for this? Can I make them pay the amount back? Thank you very much, Joseph	
3	If an employee is out sick, may we do their termination over the phone? It is not because they are sick, it is for other reasons and our termination meeting was already scheduled but the EE called off sick.

5	Termination Pedro Vega Hi Christina, We have an EE, Pedro Vega Hired 5/16/16 9/14/16 EE was written up for running a Work Order without having full understanding of the project. Since September he has continued to scrap various parts 1/27/17 EE knowingly did not have complete knowledge of the Special Tools noted on the Project and ran the Work Order anyway. Causing damage! Due to the safety issue at hand this EE must be terminated to protect the Safety of himself and others around. We run large CNC Mills and Lathes. I would like your suggestions for wording on the Termination Letter, draft attached for review. I referenced page 24 of our attached EE Handbook. Incident happened today 30 minutes before EE's shift end time. We will terminate him upon his arrival Monday morning at 7am. Legally what are we required to pay him for arriving to work? If anything on Monday. Thank you kindly! Sincerely, Kimberly Schott Metal FX Motorsports Tel: 714-891-7680 | Fax: 714-891-7684 www.SchottWheels.com	
0	Supervisor and Employee discussed termination effective after employee takes vacation. This is outside of company procedure; are there any compliance issues?	
5	Just after receiving your email response, we ending up having to send the employee for testing. He subsequently he failed drug/ alcohol test, so we terminated him. I wanted some additional guidance regarding how to communicate with the company. We would generally send a message out stating that the employee is no longer with the company because of a violation of company policy/values.	
1	We are looking at terminating an employee and want to discuss the possible risks.	
5	Exempt employee started work with us Monday, was a no-show for the next few days (claimed he was texting the wrong number), then we terminated him after he back to work due to a negative background report. Do we owe him for all days, or just the days he worked?	
3	Our handbook states you cannot use PTO in your notice period. We have an employee who is currently on PTO and has leaked they will not be returning. They did not tell us they plan to quit because they wanted paid out all of their PTO. They plan to tell us they are not returning after their PTO is exhausted. We know this because they sent text messages to another employee stating this was the case. Can we separate employment now or even at the beginning of their time off period and not pay out any PTO? We have about 1715 employees nationwide. This employee works at one of our Connecticut locations. We have 4 locations in CT with approx. 120 total employees among all locations.	
2	What are the legal requirements for a termination for New York State? Are we required to give a termination notice?	
6	What are the final pay rules for CA employees? Do you have to pay them same day? Is direct deposit or wire acceptable forms of payment, etc. as long as they receive payment the same day of termination? Thanks!	
4	We have nurse who is also on SSI for a disability. She's been making numerous errors and we do not feel safe having her around patients. Can we terminate her?	
5	We have an employee that would like to retire but would like to work part time. We are going to let him work part time, if we have work available. When we get to the point that we have no part-time work, will he be able to file for unemployment? Will he be able to collect unemployment if he is only working part time?	
6	If after being fired an employee damages company property (holes in wall, broken light plate...) Can we deduct those costs from their final paycheck and is there any other recourse we can take?	
0	I received late wage penalty claim from labor commission. We paid last check within 24 hours. The claim is for not paying for vacation time.	
6	Employer fired an employee yesterday, and they pay employees weekly. Insurance is billed a month in advance, but deducted in weekly increments from employee paychecks. Can they deduct the rest of the months premium from the final week's check?	
2	Hi Christina, Thank you for your email. Termination is due to the return of maternity leave employee. Do you have any template?

5	We have an employee who is required to travel for his job. Our policy is to reimburse travel expenses up to 80% of the cost. The employee is demanding 100% reimbursement from the employer, otherwise he states he he will not travel. Could we consider this as insubordination and terminate ehis employment? He is working in New Mexico.	
5	We have a group in MS that hired an employee. He passed his drug test but is now bragging to other employees that he swapped out the samples and that's how he passed his drug test. Can they fire him based on these statements?	
6	We have an employee who has left the company. When we issue the final check, we include any unused paid time off. For this employee, the paid time off is pretty substantial. She happens to be the previous bookkeeper and she is stating the employer could change the tax rate to allow for a lower deduction because the check will be substantial. Can the employer do this?	
4	I have a client in NY with the following question: We have an employee who has been with the company for only a short amount of time (8/22), but has called off her fair share. I know that the law only requires a medical notice for 3 days or more missing from work, but it seems apparent that she's abusing the fact that she's "simply not getting paid, so it 'doesn't matter. What are the legal repercussions of termination?	
6	I have an employee giving notice for their last day to be Oct 27th. Our payroll runs on the 5th and 20th of every month. She wants to have vacation the 16th through 23rd. We want to end her employment for the 13th and give final pay on 20th. Can we do this for a Wisconsin employee?	
1	1. We have an employee who has communicated that he actively seeking other employment. We have open door policy, and have indicated we support employees who may feel their success lies elsewhere, however, this is the first person who actually advised us. We would like to put a time restriction on him ;e.g. three months and then after three months terminate. 2. Two years ago we hired an employee on part-time basis for a project. He was then moved to full time for 1.5 year or so. The project is coming to an end. The employee's skill set is not transferable. Can we terminate employment? Could we allow the individual to work part time later if needed? We are planning to offer a severance. What is considered reasonable? What about the timing? SHould we provide advanced notice?	
1	Hi, we have some employees who have worked for us at our restaurant on and off in the past so we kept them as active employees but now they haven't worked for us in over a year and we would like to terminate them. I was wondering what the proper procedure is around this since they haven't formally quit but we have not had shifts for them, nor did they reach out asking for shifts...	
6	We have a former employee who worked for us for one day and left at break, never returned and was unresponsive when we reached out. The office didnt realize this employee was ever employee, and thus his final check has been delayed. Do we owe penalty pay?	
6	What are the final pay rules for CA employees? Do you have to pay them same day? Is direct deposit or wire acceptable forms of payment, etc. as long as they receive payment the same day of termination? Thanks!	
3	I have had some managers express some confusion over terminations in an at-will state. They think they can just tell an employee, we don't need you anymore and let them go. This would be an employee who is a problem employee who has performance issues who they don't want to work with. I think they should write up the person and terminate them more effectively.	
3	We had someone quit with no notice and I know we have 72 hours. I guess they told somebody that they wanted direct deposit - is that ok to do? They told the payroll person they wanted direct deposit - does this need to be in writing? What is the penalty for missing the 72 hours?	
1	We have an employee that we notified that Fri is last day. We are terming them. The are electing to quit tomorrow. Will they be eligible for unemployment benefits?	
2	Can you please provide samples of post-employment benefit guides? The document example is one that provides information for final pay when you leave, what happens to benefits. This is for the state of Illinois.	
2	Is being laid off due to lack of work, considered "Termination for cause"	
1	Reduction in Force- We have identified a few people to be laid off and have a couple of openings at a new location. One of the RIF employee would be good candidate for this position. Should we offer it to him before or after RIF? In addition, we have another employee in the same capacity that is not being RIF's that may be interested in the position. Do I tell her about the opening?	
0	EE on 10/5 resigned - two week notice. She just walked out. I want to confirm we do not have to pay her vacation time. Our policy states we do not pay out vacation at time of separation.	
1	Amy, This was really helpful for our layoffs scheduled 10/30/17 in TX & NY. Going forward, I would also like required forms and outplacement links like those below for the other States we have employees in (CA, CO, HI, MD, NJ, OR, UT, VA, & WA). Thx!!! Teri Baker Teri Baker Human Resources Manager	
1	We have an employee who is has been absent for three days (no show no call) and we are moving ahead with a separation. I can't get a check until Monday, what date should I use for a termination date?	
5	I called the employee's emergency contact and his father didn't know where he was and mentioned a drug problem. Our no call no show policy is after one day it is a job abandonment. What can I do? We've never had issues with him before so this is all a surprise.	
1	I wanted to run a scenario by you to get your thoughts/advise. Specifically, we are concerned with any potential areas of risk/vulnerability the company could face if an associate whose performance has been subpar and whose working hours are significantly impacted due to caring for a sick family member. My initial thought, is that since our Associates are employed At Will, as stated in our Assoc. Handbook, then we should be okay. We also list various steps that could be taken as it relates to performance management and plan to follow those guidelines. So, I think our risk of retaliation (from a legal perspective) is pretty remote. However, since Im by no means an expert in HR, wanted to get some expert advice.

5	I have additional info to add to my question regarding one our programmers who had a stroke and has been out on disability since 2-2-17. He has a doctors note allowing him to return to work on 11-14-17.. He actually was not in a crucial position. He was relatively new and no one now occupies that position as its no longer necessary. Work conditions have changed weve lost business and that position no longer exists. What are our obligations, if any? ________________________________________	
3	If an employee resigns their position do you need to continue to employ them for the duration of their notice?	
3	Follow-up to the last issue. Workers comp has notified us they are going to settle with the employee. He is currently on FMLA through December due to the injury and pending surgery. Can we still offer voluntary resignation as a part of the settlement or does that create added risk because of FMLA?	
4	Our VP who has been here less than a year. It has been a rocky relationship with her and the owner. She cries a lot, lots of employees have complained. This morning she emailed the owner and said that she was going to work from home this morning and that she would be in a 2pm for their meeting and then went into how she has been checking in with her too much. He feels that she is not focused and not doing what he needs. He has checked in her. He told her that she has . She replied OK I will stop working all together, good luck. Can I treat it as she quit? She had him sign a contract that if he let her go within a certain amount of time she will receive severance. Can he take that legally as she resigned. He wants to have her sign a release form that she does not have to pay back her bonus.	
4	If she voluntarily gave notice and we let her go early when would we have to give her, her final paycheck?

What happens when there are extenuating circumstances that prevent us from being able to calculate final commissions?

5	Employee is suspected of being under the influence. We have a drug free workplace policy and his authorization acknowledgement. Can we terminate if he tests positive?	
3	Client had an employee submitted resignation letter effective 10/1 however LDW was 9/29 which was a Friday; normal work week is M-F. The employer did not specify termination date on the former employee's LDW and has been continuing to cover the employee under the GHP based on the 10/1 resignation date. The employer wants to know what the actual termination date is and if they can require the employee to pay their portion of the benefits premium for October and if he does not pay terminate coverage? What would happen if the employee's work week included the weekends?

4	I would like to terminate a new employee at-will. She just started yesterday and both days she had been called by her son's school to pick him up ill. She is not a great worker so far and I need someone in that role. Is there anything you think I need to consider before making my decision?	
3	I need to know about waiting time penalties for a final paycheck. The employee's last day was the 8th however, they only work weekends. Would we only owe waiting time penalties on days for the days they work?	
4	An employee was let go recently due to not showing up for work. She received but used her vacation hours that she had available after 1 year of employment. She was just short of her 2 year anniversary, and had not yet received the additional vacation time. Do we owe her any vacation time?

She is pregnant, and is claiming that she is absent because of her pregnancy. Her manager would like to terminate her for excessive absenteeism and ongoing work mistakes. Please advise.	
6	Is a company allowed to withhold benefit premiums, from the final check, at the time of their termination, even if the balance falls below minimum wage? I need this confirmed for both VT and KY states. o If we are not allowed to withholding those premium costs we may consider changing the current termination dates on the benefit plans to DOT instead of end of month.

3	Recommendation regarding temporary employee who has only been with the company for two weeks and is not meeting the rate standards. What can the employer do?	
5	I have an employee who clocked himself in with a supervisor code. He's denying it. I had a job I had people come in on at 4am. The manager did not show up until 415a. No one clocked in at 4am. The one employee, whose passcode has been changed before, he is the only one that has a 4am punch in and it was done with the owner pass code, which has been changed twice. I asked him he got is time in and he didn't respond. I texted again, he didn't respond. He texted my manager and said he was available to work on Wednesday. The manager called me and we told him he couldn't work until he called me. He said he wrote his name down on a piece of paper. confirmed with both of them and neither of them used it, and it was put in at the same time he clocked out. I would like to terminate him, for multiple other reasons. Could I just its at-will? The manager is his brother and I still have not pulled up the cameras to see. I told him I thought he did it. What does at-will mean?	
1	We have employees in CA, AZ, KY, GA. Can we deduct the cost of unreturned uniforms at termination?	
2	Severance Agreement and General Release consideration and revocation periods?	
4	We finished the investigation and it was inconclusive. The employee who complained provided her two weeks notice. Do we need to follow up with her on the investigation? She said she wants to provide the two weeks but doesn't actually want to work because she doesn't feel comfortable working with the cook. She just wants us to pay her the two weeks until she finds a job.	
4	We have an employee who went out on workers comp in May, exhausted all FMLA. During check-in while out on DI, discovered EE did not have surgery stated - turns out chiropractor signed off on impairment. We returned her to work and then two-weeks post return, she said she fell again in a shower while cleaning. Filed another WC claim, recorded statement conflicts the story she told us (recorded statement says she fell by the pool). EE's new WC claim was denied and after understanding more about EE's character and integrity, we would like to terminate. What are our risks?	
4	An employee has a bumper sticker on her vehicle that may be offensive to our members. Her manager had asked that she hide the bumper sticker when parking at work. She has been hiding it, but today forgot to do so. The manager was reprimanding her for not hiding it today, and their conversation erupted in to an argument, and the manager terminated the employee. As the HR representative for the company, I believe the termination was not warranted and the employee should be reinstated. But I am unclear as to what law might apply. Please advise. The club is located in South Carolina.	
5	I have an employee who did not show up for work for 3 days or advise his manager that he was going to be out sick. He came in today and sent an email that he had a sore throat. When he did not come to work I called his emergency contact who said he was sick. Another family member called his manager and left a message saying he had a stroke. As our handbook states that not calling or showing up 3 consecutive days may be considered a voluntary resignation. Are we able to ask for a doctor's note to determine whether he had an illness that prevented him from coming in to work or calling before we terminate him?	
3	If we layoff a part-time employee because an employee with seniority wants their position, can the laid off employee file for Unemployment benefits? The laid off employee has a full time job with another employer.	
5	We have a very new employee who was in a car accident. He stated he was very shaken up by this and his manager told him to take a few days off. We did not hear from the employee and then on 10/5 he contacted us via email to say that he was have anxiety/depression/stress. We let him know that we would need to have note from his doctor in order to accommodation. We have since not heard from him and we've made several attempts to reach out to him. We have a no call no show policy, can we terminate.	
2	Can you provide a sample termination/layoff letter that I can use that includes information on how to file for unemployment? Further do you have info on if a salary reduction or loss of hours would qualify for unemployment and how an individual can go about filing? We have a group that is going through layoffs and wants to provide their employees with as much support as possible.	
1	An employee is resigning on 10/31/17. We decided to let her go on 10/16/17. We process regular payroll on 10/16/17 including hers through payroll company and direct deposit. We will pay her till 10/31/17 separately. Should we prepare manual check and give her on 10/16/17 at the exit meeting?	
5	I am the generalist in our HR department. Our head HR person is no longer with the company and I have a supervisor asking me if he can terminate an employee. I feel that we have enough to substantiate a termination, but I would like a second opinion. This employee has been with us for 11 months and has excessive absences (has missed 49 days since his date of hire). He had coaching sessions with the supervisor in March, again in May and documented warnings in June and another in July. In the July warning, it indicates that he needs to call in to his supervisor when he is going to be sick, to not leave a message, and that he cannot exceed 13 sick hours in a month. He exceeded that in September when a co-worker died, so we made an accommodation. But now in October he has already missed this whole week. The supervisor has everything documented and the warning says failure to comply with the corrective action may result in termination. Would we be safe to proceed?	
2	I have somebody who is voluntarily terminating today, and I need a voluntary term letter.	
1	I have an employee who has been out on FMLA. Their FMLA expired September 18th. We have tried to reach them by phone, email and FedEx. This employee is unresponsive and we'd like to terminate.	
5	New hire went through initial training and was told by supervisor that he would be called when the work schedule was arranged. The employee told the supervisor that his phone might be shut off. The supervisor attempted to contact the employee with the work schedule without success for a number of days. The employee made no attempt to contact the supervisor. The supervisor advised HR who suggested the supervisor make a few more attempts to contact the employee and after about 10 days without a response from the employee the HRM sent a job abandonment letter. The employee called and stated that he was unavailable for three days due to a hand procedure however the HRM stated that the termination stood as it was nearly two when where he made no contact with the employer; nor did he advise the employer that he was having a procedure and would not be available. The employee was told he could reapply however when the employee reapplied for a position he was rejected due to the job abandonment and is now threatening to take legal action. General discussion.	
5	An employee in NY has been stating that he is going to resign, on numerous occassions, so we hired a replacement. He has stated that he is going to hold out until after he receives his referral bonus. We spoke to him and he said he really wasnt sure, as he has not had time to look for another job. Our managers want to fire him because they have found a replacement , his attendance has not been great, he is not a good performer and his demeanor is negative. Risks?

5	Hi, We made a verbal agreement to hire a minimum wage part-time cashier. He came in for orientation, completed paperwork and watched our new hire videos. He was told he must get the required food handler card before getting put on the schedule. Shortly afterwards, a few employees informed us that they would quit if he gets hired. They claim he is a "stalker" and they would be uncomfortable around him. However, if we put that concern aside, he has sent a couple of text messages to the hiring manager demanding to be put on the schedule. His text messages are very lengthy and convey a message of insubordination, threatening and inappropriate. He hasn't even started and he is already such a problem to us. We would like to rescind the offer we made to him. Is there anything we should be concerned about? Given how angry he has been that last few days, we do expect him to be upset about this. Thanks!	
2	An employee provided a verbal resignation and has refused to provide a written resignation as per our policy. I am sending a confirmation letter to the employee indicating that we received and accepted the employee's verbal resignation on [x] date. Must I send that both via email and regular mail?	
0	We have an employee who resigned without notice and she has a very little vacation due but I can not get a check until Monday. Do we have to automatically pay the penalty?	
6	If employee resigns, when is final pay due (California employee)?	
4	Employee was terminated. The company she works for is one of our subsidiaries in NV. Upon her term, she filed for UI in CA. Should we respond to this claim?	
3	I have an employee you has self terminated themselves, by not showing up for her shifts three consecutive days in a row.

We terminated the one employee. We have now received a letter from her lawyer stating that we terminated her due to her pregnancy. How are we to respond to this?

5	ThinkHR Team, Please see below and advise: Once of our housemen gave us a verbal two weeks notice, we have a resignation form that we typically have them fill out when they give verbal notice just so we have something in writing. His supervisor did not give him the form, she was going to do so today. Today that same employee who gave notice came in to tell me that he had allegedly been, in his mind, sexually harassed by a fellow co-worker. Under those circumstances, I have to do my part and investigate his claim. Im doing the write up today and will speak with the other party involved. There were no witnesses. The question is, since he verbally resigned, do we give him the resignation form to complete? I dont want to create the impression that we are in any way forcing him to resign or create the perception we want him gone because he filed a complaint. Plain and simple he resigned. What is the best way to handle this one?

They returned the envelope to me. I went to the post office to mail it return receipt - the check is still not cashed. This was March 6th. I know the address is correct, I called the employee's brother and he confirmed the address. The check is uncashed and they have it. He filed for unemployment and today is the hearing. I issued another check - I was hoping we could give it during the meeting. Unfortunately we missed the hearing. I called unemployment to see if we can be late. They said we can appeal for another hearing. What do I do now? He doesn't have a telephone. I think when I called before they said? He mentioned collapsing and that we should have called 911. He was talked to about absences and made all these complaints in 10 minutes and left. He was a driver and was transferred after a vendor complaint in November. When they transferred him he said "I'm tired of driving, anyway." We have a new attendance policy everyone is being held to.

We had an employee who used to work here and after he no longer worked here, he and the employee who is leaving when to a bar, after a conference and hit on her and she rebuffed him. He came back to work with us a few months later. The project the female employee was working on was taken away due to performance issues, but given to this male employee. She refers to a clique in the company including this employee "mean girls" of the company. Now we understand this may be a role in her decision for leaving - not dealing with the "mean girls." The supervisor thought the assignments were fair, the male employee has more knowledge, experience, etc. I have an exit interview scheduled Monday and I was planning to bring this up with her. Since there was no relationship or retaliation, there's a mindset you have to earn your promotions, etc. Should I dialogue or simply document the supervisor's statement?

5	Think HR, In follow up to our inquiry yesterday, below is additional information, please review and advise: I have more details on this situation that ThinkHR should be aware of: The employee that filed the complaint was about going to be terminated. He has warnings in his file regarding tardiness, no call no show and even yesterday, he was 45 minutes late to the office.

Looking at my notes, the employee lodging the complaint made a comment about the alleged harassment, specifically alluding to the other employees sexual preference. Im not sure if that makes a difference or not but I thought it best to pass it along.	
1	Hello, We keep running into issues with recent hires (within 90 days) that do not meet the necessary expectations of their job requirements, such as performance goals and speed/accuracy. What is the best policy to deal with situations like this as far as the write-up process and ultimate termination? Specifically, what requirements are there for simply letting someone go during the first 90 day probationary period? Should we have a 90 day probationary period section in our handbook that specifies are right to terminate w-out notice/etc for employees that just aren't cutting it? Currently, we have someone within the 90 day period that has not been able to grasp and manage the position she is in, with coaching and training/etc. She has no write-ups, currently is on bereavement leave, but just doesn't seem to be able to do her job adequately enough. What do you suggest? Thanks,

1	An employee submitted a resignation with 2 weeks' notice. We do not like the way the resignation was communicated so we would like to terminate but not pay unemployment. How can we do that?	
4	We have an employee who has been with us for about four weeks and we are looking at letting her go. She has been absent but most importantly, she is make errors and not learning from them.	
0	If an employer moves from a vacation policy to a PTO policy, does that affect the payout of accrued time at termination? Does the word accrued vs. awarded affect the requirement to pay out that time at termination?	
3	Employee resigned providing 2 weeks notice and he already submitted an unemployment claim. Does that mean we can forgo issuing the Notice of Change in Relationship?	
1	I am going to be downsizing and letting people go of three employees, due to our business need. There is not enough business to justify the number of current positions. Two of the people I will be letting go have been working here for a long time (and are over age 40). The reason the three have been chosen is based on performance. Do you see any issues with this? If we consider offering severance, how should we provide this?	
3	Our policy for no call/no show is 2 consecutive days equals a job abandonment. What is technically the final day of employment?	
5	An employee emailed us around midnight last night stating he was resigning. He took our company truck with about $2500 worth of tools and drove from CA to his home in Phoenix. That truck and those tools are needed for a project this morning. We will pursue criminal charges. What type of charges might we be able to pursue?	
6	I have an employee who has resigned and gave us notice. Her last day will be February 10th; this is the end of our next payroll period. We normally pay that out on the 17th. When would her final check be due in this instance? Could we pay her out early (our normal next pay date is 2/3 and I will be gone on her last day).	
2	Our company is located in MD and we make MD unemployment contributions. We have a recently separated employee who lives in PA and filed for unemployment benefits in both PA and MD. How is this handled? I need to respond to the unemployment insurance agency by 2/1/17. You can call me at 410-751-1010 or email at andrea.weisz@masterworkscs.com. Thank you. Andrea Weisz	
1	We have an employee who was terminated last year who is filing for unemployment. We sent the workforce commission documents and they are asking for more information. When looking through the documents we have noted there was a recording made of the conversation with the former employee. Was this legal to do so? What can we pass on to the workforce commission?	
4	Brent Daily brent@distillerysolutions.com 7206637344 Distillery Solutions Colorado - We have an employee who will be leaving soon. It is a mutual agreement to part ways. She had a relationship with the founder that did not work out. There are some changes in her performance.	
1	Michelle called for Tim - We have an employee who submitted his resignation, giving 10 weeks' notice. We want to know if we have to keep him for the 10 weeks. The employee says yes. We don't think so, but wanted to talk about it.	
0	I have a question regarding accrued vacation. Our handbook states that EE's begin accruing vacation on day one of employment but can not start using it until completion of their 90 day introductory period. If an employee terminates prior to the 90 days, is the accrued owed to the EE even though he could not have used it during his tenure?	
1	We have a nest camera in the office for security reasons as well as an alarm system with cameras. We just caught an employee on the camera shopping online, checking their phone, checking their Facebook account, etc. Can we use this footage as evidence? If we terminate this person, I don't want to pay her unemployment.	
1	Good day to you. We have a few employees who are based in DC and will be terminated as of Feb 28 2017, we are providing them with their Status of Benefits package, but cannot find a Record of Employment Form that we give to NY employees. Are we required to give them a form? Also, we prepare a letter with the following text, how do we word for the DC employees? We write to confirm the following information: Your last day of employment with WNET is January 6, 2017. In connection with your termination of employment, a Status of Benefits is attached. We enclose a copy of the New York State Department of Labor Unemployment Insurance Divisions Record of Employment. Pursuant to New York law, the company is required to furnish this Record of Employment to all employees who separate from employment. Thank you so much for your help with this. Patricia 212 560 2714 bowenp@wnet.org	
6	When an employee is separated from the company in the early part of the month, and has an additional payroll deduction for health benefits, may we take the additional deduction from their final paycheck?	
1	An employee passed away over the weekend. I know our company would like to contribute to the surviving spouse and children. We are looking to a memorial fund. Is there anything else we can do? Can we pay the COBRA premiums?	
1	We are preparing to terminate an employee tomorrow for misappropriation of company credit card. Just want to make sure we have all the necessary paperwork.	
1	We are laying off our F&B Manager because we are reorganizing our facility. He is not happy about this and feels it is something personal. Should we provide him with an exit interview, and if so, what types of questions should we ask? Can you please send me the CA required separation notices?	
0	Some states have their own rules regarding payment of PTO time upon termination. They vary. Im trying to find out if because we are a NJ Corp does NJ law apply or the particular state the employee works in.	
5	We would like to terminate an employee who has been working outside of his work restrictions (non-work related). We have written him up before and he continues to do things outside his requirements. What are our risks? He is currently applying for LTD without carrier.	
3	My colleague at Hexagon MasterWorks in Maryland has question regarding unemployment. Specifically she recently terminated an employee who lives in Pennsylvania. Below is the message my colleague sent: "I received a notice from Maryland regarding unemployment for XXXXXXX in this mornings mail I had received a notice from Pennsylvania on Friday. She lives in PA, so can she apply in both states? We dont pay unemployment insurance in PA, just in MD. Does this change how I respond to PA (I haven't mailed that one in yet)?	
6	An employee gave her resignation on Friday, but worked Saturday. When is her final pay due?	
3	In January we didn't have normal work for everybody. Most of the employees were taking vacation end of December and beginning of January. The employees have not been on their regular schedule. Some employees were doing prep for the tear down. Some employees cannot do that work. An employee was on vacation and then couldn't return due to his back. He can't do the work. Can they apply for unemployment?	
6	When an employee quits and they took the company laptop. 1. What are the ways to get the company equipment back? 2. Are we able to hold their final check until they return the equipment? 3. If they were caught stealing and we have identified the amount are we legally able to take that amount out of their last paycheck?	
6	In regards to wage/pay stubs, when paying someone their final pay and their PTO is it best practice to provide two separate checks?	
2	Thank you. Do you have a sample authorization form?	
3	Think HR Team, We have a client that is a small retailer with fewer than 50 employees. They just discovered that one of their new employees has been stealing inventory, specifically beer. . They have it on their surveillance video that the employee stole at least 80 cases of beer last week, and they believe the total theft totals around $5,000. They plan to call the police tomorrow to press charges. In the meantime, can they withhold the employees next paycheck to recoup some of the losses? The wages will only be a few hundred dollars compared to the thousands that they employee stole, but are they able to do such a thing if there is a termination for cause?	
5	We terminated an employee and gave him two reasons for why we were terminating him. It started to get heated and we asked him to leave the building. He applied for unemployment and we said that we would say we were just laying him off. My question is whether we need to disclose to him the 9 reasons for termination.	
4	We have reason to believe that our Director of Programming has been leaving work work early to take private clients. She says she is working from home, however when staff try to contact her she has limited availability. The ;employer wants to terminate her employment.	
0	do we need to pay unused vacation earned to an employee that does not show up for work. no call no show. Employee is in state of Nevada, Employer is in state of WI. Our policy reads- Upon termination of employment employees will be paid for unused vacation time that has been earned through the last day of work. However if Company in its sole discretion terminates employment for cause, forfeiture of unused vacation time may result.	
4	We have an employee who is unable to pass a certification test. This has become an undue hardship because she is unable to work in a state and we have been covering her shift with another employee. In essence, we are paying two pharmacist to do the work of one. She has now stated that she may need surgery in the future, but we won't know detail until Feb. 10th. She is not eligible for FMLA as she has not meet the requirements. What are our options?	
1	We have two employees who we are planning to terminate. Neither has reached their goals, even after PIP plans, and adjusting the goals to try to get them there. We may have had another position available, however, their behavior as of late has been such that we no longer would consider them. What should we put on the termination notice?	
4	One of our employees took an unpaid leave. When she was ready to return, we didn't have her position available, as one of our client's had passed away. We offered her a full-time position at our other site, but she turned it down because it was too far to drive. We told her she could be "contingent" at the site she used to work at, but she needed to contact the site supervisor and sign an employee change form, which she never did. A couple of weeks later she called and asked if the full-time position she refused was still available, which it is not because we hired two people in the meantime. So, finally, to my question. Do we need to send her a "formal" termination letter?	
6	We have an employee who has resigned and have done an inventory of his company issued truck and about $250 worth of tools are missing. Can we take that out of his final check?	
5	In June an employee resigned, 2 weeks, leading up to that there were some performance issues. There were many documented performance issues. There was also discriminatory comments that were said, however, the employer took appropriate action to resolve them and both employee's were disciplined. Employee has contacted employer and said that he wanted to talk about his performance and the comments that were made to him while he was as employed.	
4	I have an employee who started 11/4 at the front desk, doing general office work. Around the end of November and beginning of December she advised she was pregnant. She has since had excessive absences and tardiness. In addition, she is not following company policy when calling in, circumventing taking to her supervisor or HR as per company policy. This is after we have worked with her to provide a modified schedule. She is within her 90 day probationary period and we would like to terminate.	
4	We had an employee who walked out on the job. She is returning today saying that she did not quit and that we need to fire her. I have several questions that I need some advise. 1. She is stating that the she is being railroaded and that the owner is mad because she did not make a position for the owner's daughter. Is there a document or a filing that we should do in order to protect ourselves from any type of lawsuit that she may file for "not being fired" and her perception of being railroaded?	
1	We are terminating an employee and we are letting him go today and I will provide him last week and this week pay, is it okay to deduct benefits?	
5	An employee filed a claim for STD, told us it was denied, and came back to work. The claim was approved and he has been receiving STD checks for a few months, while continuing to work. We understand that this is a felony under insurance codes, but can we terminate him due to his dishonesty?	
0	Donna Lee (unregistered user) In the states of California and New York, do employers have to pay out unused vacation accruals at termination?	
0	terminating an employee, do we need to pay out vacation? We do not offer vacation until an employee has been with us for one year. They do not accrue it, they just get 40 hours are their 1 year anniversary.	
3	Can a part time employee file for unemployment benefits?	
4	Unregistered Patricia Gonzalez 562-699-4550 We have a 5 yr employee who has had many tardy/absenteeism issues. She is on her final warning now, called off Sunday to care for her grandmother, called off Monday because her kids are sick, and her husband called us today stating that she is missing. Can we terminate? Our policy is that the EE must call us personally, not a family member.	
3	I you have an employee who job abandons how long do you have to hold onto their personal property? For example - I have an employee who voluntarily resigned/job abandoned - we mailed their personal belongings to their house - and the box was returned. How long do we need to hold onto it?	
2	Thank you for the quick and detailed response. The employee is from Wisconsin and refuses to travel to Illinois. Do you know if the rules are different for the state of Wisconsin?	
3	If there is an employee who is receiving Unemployment income and then if the employer files bankruptcy, can the employee still receive unemployment?	
1	We have an employee that charged personal expenses on the company credit card. The employee signed the credit card policy which indicates the card cannot be used for personal expenses. The employee was terminated and we are wondering if we can withhold earnings from the last paycheck to pay off the balance of the credit card for the personal expenses. We don't feel the employee will make the payment to the credit card company. Is there any recourse to withholding the earnings?	
3	Sundberg and Sundberg offers 4 weeks paid leave to employees on FMLA who have been determined by a doctor to need 4 consecutive weeks off work. The agreement is to maintain the paid leave an employee must return to work full time for 1 year. For the first time we have an employee who chose not to return. She was paid 160 hours at 18.00 an hour for a gross of 2880.00. Is this the amount she should repay?This policy is in the handbook.

4	We have an employee that worked for us very part-time for 7 weeks total. She tried to file unemployment and paid family leave. When she left, it was a mutual agreement to end employment because she wasn't a good fit. It has been non-stop harassment. She is calling, emailing our CEO, threatening legal action. She left in January. She worked maybe 60 hours. She emailed me and stated she never got final pay. I did submit the fraud claim anonymously because she is nuts. The things she is saying doesn't add up.	
4	I have a question about eliminating some positions due to restructuring. Hire a new CEO who is reorganizing firm and wants to eliminate a couple of positions (in Tennessee). Elimination of position: job duties will be absorbed by other employees. One is a VP of Sales position (over 40) two managers in a department of 3. Choice between male and female over 40. The other is more complicated the employee impacted has many issues involved in their employment, such as vendor complaints, verbal discussion and coaching, vendors did not want to work with her anymore. Verbal communications only. Invoices lagging for three months with $300 K outstanding AR's. Her supervisor has been ill and therefore she did not have direct supervision so employer took over process; were in the process of terminating her due to her performance when she got into an accident and was out for a while and is now back.	
3	If an employee is terminated for positive drug(marijuana) testing, do they still get their sick days paid out to them?	
4	For a termination. Employee on a PIP and for time and attendance as well as performance. Neither have improved. During time frame she told us she is pregnant. We want to make sure ok to terminate. Calls in at least twice a week and never on time.	
0	Which states require a payout of accrued PTO upon termination? We have a sales force across the US and their homes are considered their work location.	
3	In reference to a small group. They will be laying off an employee for about 4-6 weeks due to it being a slow period. Are they required to keep them actively enrolled under their group medical plan?	
2	Are there any required forms for employees who resign? If the employee is working through November 10th, do benefits end November 30th. Should we have a memo with the resignation agreement - do you have a sample? Do you have a sentence or two you can forward to me? SHould we have cancel review?	
4	Earlier this year received information regarding pregnant employee who was not yet eligible for FMLA/CFRA. We provided her the leave as prescribed under the Pregnancy Disability Leave in California. She has since been released to return to work, however, she is advising that she cannot come into work because she does not have any daycare options. We want to send her a letter stating that based on this information, we are assuming she has resigned her position. Do you have a sample letter in this regard?	
5	A Minnesota employee resigned on July 28th. That was his last day worked. He did not submit his hours through our time system so we did not pay any final hours. On Sept. 1st he emailed him manager his final work hours. Those hours were not received in our corporate office until yesterday. What wage and hour liabilities could we face?	
3	It was brought to the employer's attention that an employee submitted a forged prescription using another employee's (MD) signature. The pharmacy called the clinic's manager to verify the MD signature and when checking with the MD discovered that the MD did not issue the prescription. The employer wants to terminate the employee however is concerned that she will file a rehab claim under FMLA/ADA. Considerations?	
4	We had an employee with an extensive poor attendance issue and poor performance. She was also causing a hostile working environment. She could not get along with her co-workers. She worked with the company for 1 year. The employee and I met and decided that she would resign before termination. The employee still has not submitted a formal resignation letter. Will this employee be eligible for unemployment?	
3	We have a large employer who is having a lay off as of October 31st. The employees will be notified on Monday, October 23. They have an employee of almost 3 years, who will be one of the 6 laid off. She is pregnant and has already put in for FMLA leave beginning on November 16th. The STD/LTD coverages are only available for active full-time employees and are not portable. Of the 6 individuals that will be let go, they will still have a part-time receptionist position of .5 that is left This will be offered to an individual who they believe will turn down the position and then to the individual we are referencing. She will still not be eligible for the STD benefits as part-time. Our analysis would be that the individual financially would be better off taking the unemployment versus the PT position due to her upcoming pregnancy leave. Are we missing anything in reviewing this case with the group?	
4	I have an employee with an unknown medical problem for the past 2-3 months. She has missed a lot of time and has requested to leave early on multiple occasions due to pain. I have offered her a LOA and a reduced schedule on several occasions which she has declined. on 10/9 she texted me to say she was admitted to the hospital and I have not heard from her since. She has sporadically answered texts from other employees. She was not a great employee to begin with and I'd like to terminate her. We need a dependable reliable person in this position and I don't see her being able to perform her duties.

5	We are in an industry slow down. We have an employee who has stated he would voluntarily take the winter off to help the situation. The employer is concerned about maintaining his health benefits during this time. We were wondering if we allowed him to work every other week, what would be the impact? Would he be eligibile for unemployment benefits? What about his benefits? We pay bi-weekly so he would still get his pay on the scheduled pay date.	
3	Question from one of my clients. Our current practice is that an employee's last day of insurance is the last day they work. And if they have remaining vacation hours, then we just pay them out. We have an employee who wants to make his last day Dec 15 but then use 2 weeks vacation to extend his insurance through Dec 31. Do other employers permit? My initial concern is - what if that employee gets hurt/has a critical illness during those 2 weeks, then TA is technically responsible for that claim....	
4	We terminated an employee who was telecommuting in North Carolina because she was not following our telecommuting agreement. We gave her the option to work from New York or another physical work site or her employment would terminated. She decided not to relocate. Can we hold her final pay until she returns her computer?	
1	We have a CA loan officer (LO) who has signed our LO agreement indicating upon termination our company will comp the LO for any loans they originated that close within 30-days of their separation. We are being challenged on this by a separated LO . I cannot find anything in the CA law that indicated we need to pay for this closing. Thank you When we have an inside LO, according to our compliance, we have to pay them at least minimum wage - a salary draw of a couple thousand dollars and the commission goes against the draw in the second pay period. Commission schedules - one is calendar and one is mid-month. This loan officer in the Irvine office was mid-month and we looked at loans closed 16-15th of the month. Commissions are earned for a one-month period. We pay based on closing date. If the loan closes within 30 days, we would not be paying commissions for him, because commissions have already been paid. Our agreements indicate we will pay for any loans they originated as long as they close within 30 days of termination. This loan closed 10 days later after his termination.	
5	We have an employee who has been out and just found out he is in jail. We have spoken to him directly and he stated he will be incarcerated through November. We are considering separation. Could the incarceration be protected under law?	
1	We have a employee who is in jail for a undetermined amount of time for reasons unknown. Can we terminate him?	
4	I had an employee quit this morning. She started at 7:55 and then clocked out at 8:30. Do I pay her for the actual time or do I need to pay her reporting time?	
4	We want to terminate an employee and offer severance. She is not working out. We have lost clients following projects she worked on. We have received requests from clients to remove her form their project. Do we need to provide her with advanced notice that her performance is poor or we have concerns about her performance under state law?	
4	We had two of our managers let an employee go this morning. They opened the folder and she grabbed her check and ran out. She is not emailing that she is going to sue us. They had the change in relationship form, etc. Am I required to mail her the form? She is texting the manager that she is going to sue for prejudice and harassment.	
1	We have two former employees who have been terminated and will be given severance. Does this go through payroll or accounts payable? Should be paid out in one lump sum or by pay period?	
1	We are putting together a retirement package for one our employees. We want to pay them their annual salary but they are going to start their retirement on November 15th. We want to continue to pay them through payroll. They would not continue to be an employee the goal is to maximize the benefit to her and to manage it financially for the company. We do not want to have to pay a lump sum. It was suggested that we provide this through payroll, can we do this or what is the best way to handle this? They are a year shy of retirement? The employee is concerned if she were to get another job how this arrangement may affect her. Please call back at 516.221.6001	
6	We have a separation. Can we automatically deduct health care premium deductions from the final paycheck?	
1	One employee was suspended without pay, and the other has been off of work through this investigation. We have in out investigation determined that the employees did indeed take steal from the organization and we will be moving forward with termination. We have made several attempts to contact the employees, and they are not responding. How should we proceed? Can we email the employees, or mail them a letter?	
3	If an employee turns in verbal notice of resignation for a future date, and the employer tells them therei12s no need to work through that date, are they eligible for unemployment?	
5	I have an employee who is getting his first paycheck this week. We pay him based on a piece-rate, so payment is made when we get paid for the job done. It looks like he is not working out, and we are considering letting him go, however, how can we handle his final pay? We may not get paid for the job for another few weeks.	
3	A group terminated an employee and did not provide paperwork on unemployment from the EDD. What should they do? Do you have that paperwork? Is there a Spanish version?	
5	Let's say a company offers a person a inside sales agent job, contingent on references and background, etc. After they check, they cannot verify education and two items on his criminal record. They called him and asked him to clarify some items. The employee went dark. The problem is, they started training him for 5 days. When they called him, he just went dark. Proper way to terminate - voluntary resignation? Technically, he put the employee on pause. Is it enough to say voluntary termination due to unresponsiveness?	
4	I have a former employee asking for a letter stating that she was terminated and the dates of termination. I provided her the dates of employment and her position. However, she would like a letter stating that she was terminated from her employment. I don't want to give too much information on this termination letter. Can I just say that she was terminated on a specific date and leave it at that?	
2	Employee verbally resigned and was supposed to pick up check yesterday, he's coming in today, can you craft a communication sample?	
6	If an employee quits on a Friday and we have 72 hours to give them their check, do Sat and Sun counts as part of the 72 hours?	
5	We have an hourly paid manager who we caught adding time to his payroll records to give him about two per day of overtime pay. We caught it on 10/17/17 when he arrived to work and clocked in at 5:33 pm ( his scheduled time was 4pm) and then noticed he had two hours of OT for that day. We checked our security reports and saw that he had edited his clock in time from 5:33pm to 2pm. we have video of him entering the restaurant at 5:33pm and two other managers witnessing that is the time he arrived. We also noticed that this has been happening for the past several Months. We have placed him on suspension as of yesterday , we believe this is fraud and he should be terminated. we also want to know if we can deduct the fraudulent hours from his time sheet. please advise	
1	On ThinkHR website, looking for documentation, when we have 15 to 20 employees we are going to layoff, do we trigger the WARN Act?	
6	We are a California based company with and office in Chicago We have just terminated an IL employee for negligence of not showing up to work for a whole week with no knowledge of his whereabouts? 1) how long after do I have to supply him/her with a final check? 2) they have a company laptop, am I allowed to withhold funds for the value of the laptop?	
4	An employee has given her 2 weeks notice. If we let her go sooner, will she be eligible for UI?	
2	Can we choose to not contest an unemployment claim when we receive a voluntary resignation? If so, how do we "not contest" the claim? (you have to choose a reason on the DOL separation information request form)	
4	New employee started in July and she has exhausted her personal leave, she creates drama, and has just taken 4 of 5 days off this week without sound reason. I would like to terminate her.	
2	Once we issue a separation with our employees under a severance agreement, do we cancel benefits or permit the benefits to continue over the duration of severance payments?	
3	We let a person go today and I was going to see if we need to pay them for coming in. They clocked in were terminated and left. They were scheduled to work 8-5 hourly employee non-exempt.	
1	According to this weeks payroll, we had 86 employed with 24 working within 75 miles (the office/shop and 2 crews). The remaining crews were in Dayton, Parshall ND; Grand Forks ND; Albert Lea MN; Pipestone MN. We feel that we have given this employee as much as we can at this point. He has missed over 326 hours this season between April 10 October 13 which is approximately 6 weeks of lost production. As a finish dozer operator his role is critical in keeping projects on time and his absences have caused major stress on crews trying to complete work on time. I have advertised and have a replacement operator ready to come on board. My preference would be to send a termination letter this week based upon excessive absences. Are we within our rights to move forward with this action? DRAFT LETTER: This letter is to notify you that your employment with Quam is terminated effective today, Friday October 20, 2017. As stated in the letter sent to you on September 11, 2017 your attendance this season has been a great concern, and is still a problem. Unfortunately, we are no longer able to rely on you to perform your job as required. Our crews depend on your ability to be on the jobsite and your absences are negatively impacting the crew and our production. If you have any questions regarding this decision, you can contact either Terry at 320-979-1166 or myself at 320-235-3344. Sincerely, Jean Spaulding HR/Safety/Marketing Director P: 320-235-3344

4	Recently hired a customer service employee. At time of hiring she informed that she had been arrested due to drugs. Was hired but later discovered on work release for other charges and has an ankle monitor which goes off quite often and causes disruption. Has been employed for three days and want to terminate. Have concerns about handling cash. Best practices for firing and also what can be said about the criminal background? She said it was her boyfriend's drugs, she was the one in the house and she got busted for it. We then found out she has her own drug possession charges. The employee did not tell us this, we heard that this may have come up in conversation with other employees. Her ankle bracelet batteries go low, and then she gets a call from the authorities to check in.	
4	We terminated someone at our retail location yesterday due to poor performance, When we sat down to start the termination meeting, she grabbed her final check from the folder and ran. She did not complete the exit paperwork, then started emailing manager with claims of racial discrimination etc. Showed up to the work-site, even though terminated, threw glass bottle at store. Continues to send harassing texts to manager - manager blocked number. What do I need to do now?

4	We have an employee that was on a PIP plan earlier in the year. She completed the plan as her performance had improved. However, her performance has again slipped and many of the items addressed previously have resurfaced. Bottom line is her department is not profitable, and we don't feel she can do the job. She is not a good fit. We are ready to terminate her and feel we can justify the termination. However, we have learned that she has several surgeries coming up, a mastectomy, chemo, etc. She has not come out and told management this. We have heard this through other employees. The location she works at is under 50 employees therefore she would not qualify for FMLA. Our company has a leave policy but there are no guarantees of a job upon return. EE us under 40 and has worked for the company since 6/216.Please advise.

4	We have an employee who got into a disagreement with some people last week. There was a four member team, she was asked for her log from one day. The standard practice is that it would be shared. She got upset and just left the worksite after about 20 minutes from the start of her shift. She didnt tell anyone, didnt ask anyone. She just left. This is normally considered job abandonment and we would terminate for this. Additionally, this employee had recently changed teams. The next day she texted her old supervisor home sick. She did this two days in a row. Friday morning she texted her old supervisor again, and the old supervisor told her she needed to contact HR and her current supervisor. She left a message with HR and her new supervisor for her to call her back. HR was out on Friday and the new supervisor was in meetings all day. On Monday morning, she called the old supervisor again and said HR and the new supervisor didnt call her back and that she was going to be out again on Monday. She told that supervisor that her doctor isnt going to release her to return to work until 5/5. We had planned to terminate her when she came back on Wednesday for abandoning her job on Monday and for not reporting her absences properly. She was previously on FMLA for anxiety and she currently applied for it and the paperwork wasnt completely filled out. The third party reached out to her and told her what they needed. They havent gotten the paperwork yet, so they havent approved it or backdated it. If she provides the proper paperwork, it they would approve it from that date on. (Issue 1 of 2)

4	Hello, we received the following email from our client, can you advise? "I have an employee that was terminated yesterday May 1st. When employees are terminated or leave the company their benefits last through the end of the month.

She is covered under: UHC, Delta Dental, EyeMed, Reliance Standard, and UNUM. I talked with our lawyer and he said it depends on the state law if I can do the double deduction and it would be best to contact the carriers. Is this something that you can help me figure out?"

If we give them only 30 hours of work per week, we know they can receive some unemployment benefits. Is there anything we need to do to assist them? 4. Anything else we should be considering?	
5	I just wanted to follow up with the attendance issue we have had with this employee. Last week he returned the ADA form and it indicated this was not a disability, and that he was released back to work. We had a conversation with him recapping this and explaining the expectation that he come to work to work his scheduled shifts. He then called out on Monday and Tuesday. The manager wants to terminate him now.	
1	We have an employee who put in two weeks' notice. We have a non-compete agreement. We decided to let him go without waiting out the two weeks. Will this affect the noncompete agreement with him? If we terminate, when will we have to provide his final pay?	
1	We need to figure out housing allowance for an employee who receives $1,960.32 per pay period (2 weeks). How would we break down this amount for three days of pay?	
4	We have an employee who is currently on CFRA bonding leave. She went from PDL to CFRA back in September. She has expressed that when she returns to work she does not want to return to a full time status. This is not due to any medical condition, and is due to her desire to spend time with her child. We are willing to work with this, but the hours she wishes to work are very limited and we cannot accommodate. We have a suggested number of hours. If she cannot work those hours would this be considered a voluntary separation?	
4	Gerry Watt called in with a question. We want to let an employee go and want to check risk. CA employee, missed 12 of last 15 shifts in the month. Her attendance is erratic. Sometimes she claims medical reasons, sometimes it is for transportation issues. We have spoken to her multiple times about improving attendance.	
6	Can an employer deduct tuition reimbursement from an employees' final check if the handbook states "If an employee resigns or is terminated within twelve (12) months after receiving reimbursement, the employee must repay RSI in full, this amount will be deducted from the final paycheck."	
4	We have a staff member who was the assistant to the Dean. We ended her employment in September, and paid her through October 27th. We also had an agreement that they would pay through December if she signed it. She did not sign the agreement, so she is now filing for unemployment. We have to respond to the EDD regarding the reason for termination. She was not a good fit, and had made false claims of workplace issues.	
4	An employee in NY recently resigned after having complained of sexual harassment. We completed our investigation and found that no sexual or any other type of harassment had occurred. Per advice from counsel, we issued her a severance pay, to settle with her. Justworks informed me that there is a flat 25% federal tax rate for severance. We have never done that before, is that correct? We do not want to upset her with that additional tax.	
6	When terminating an employee, when do they need to receive their final pay. I have an employee who we are planning to terminate by phone on Thursday. Can we FedEx the final pay to him?	
4	An employee was mad because they were asked to leave before the end of the notice period. Should I just thank her for her feedback and that we'll take this under consideration? She wants an explanation.	
4	Follow up on Oct 19 issue. The employee has never been notified of her poor work performance and now our new management team wants to terminate her without making her aware of her poor performance. This is not how we have managed terminations in the past. We have always placed employees on PIP and allowed them the opportunity to step up. But the new manager for this employee wants to move swiftly. One manager suggested we just pay her a severance to lessen the risks. If we call her termination a lay off, how soon can we hire a replacement?	
6	Employee in CA resigning. Wants to stay until the end of the month but we want to dismiss on Friday. What are our obligations/options regarding paying through notice period, final delivery of pay, etc.?	
4	An employee was terminated last Friday for cause, but we were vague in our reason. She sent me an email asking for feedback on what the reason was, and what she could have done differently. The true answer is due to her personality. She is abrasive and other employees felt intimidated by her. How should I phrase this? I want to be honest with her.	
5	For client CDS. My client's employee has been on disability leave since January of 2017. He has notified them that he will not be returning to work. How should they process his termination?	
3	Is there a checklist of laws and or procedures to be followed upon the death of an employee?	
1	We just terminated an employee, who was previously hired and terminated within the company. For termination purposes, which hire date do we use?	
6	I wanted to reconfirm the employer's responsibility for letting an employee go prior to the date they have provided in their resignation letter. We have an employee who presented a resignation letter stating that his final day of employment will be October 31, 2017. Can the employer decide to make this Friday, October 27, 2017 his final day of employment? Would we have to pay him through October 31, 2017? When would his final pay be due? What about his bonus payment?	
3	Our client who is a non profit is considering switching from State insured to self insured model for unemployment insurance. Any information would be appreciated.	
3	When you tell someone that they are laid off, is that a termination. If there is no work, they are laid off. They are not called back to work, they have no benefits or pay.	
5	Employee gave his notice; the employer would like to maintain his employment through the date of resignation he gave however does not need him to come into the office or work. He will remain an employee through the date of resignation and will come in on that date to complete termination paperwork	
5	Terminating an employee today once he arrives for his shift. What do we owe him?	
6	We pay on the 25th of each month. We have someone who is resigning and her last day will be the 31st. Can we just pay her everything on the 31st? No check on the 25th -everything on the 31st.	
3	We have an employee who has given two week notice today. The supervisor is asking if they can release them today or Friday. They do not want to pay them out for their last week. What does not do for unemployment options for them?	
5	We are an employer in New Hampshire. I have an employee that left yesterday and did not show today. I am assuming he has abandoned his job. Do we have to pay him for his vacation time?	
4	We have an employee who we are considering terminating. She works in a three person staffing office. She's training a newer employee and she's been very rude/cold/short with her trainee. She's been on company time looking online for employment, and using the company computer to be on social media for personal reasons. We have written her up for this. Recently the newer employee greeted and interviewed a person who came into the office. Our recruiters do not work on commission, but they do schedule candidates personally to interview and this candidate was to have interviewed with his mentor and he neglected to ask if the candidate had an apt. When the mentor found out she became very upset and started yelling and behaving in an unprofessional manner. When we did the investigation we had the third employee at the location disclose that she heard that the employee we wish to terminate has had in the past a history of depression and bipolar. Will this be an issue if we wish to proceed with the termination?	
5	We have an employee who has been here since 9/26/17. We would like to terminate him due to tardiness, sub standard work, and not working the agreed hours at his hire date. The problem is that he is claiming a back injury from a car accident that occurred here. He says that he is fine at work but today was supposed to be his last follow up appointment and he said he still has pain. Do we have to wait to terminate him until after he has been cleared by the doctor? It seems like he will keep saying it hurts so we can' t terminate. Thank you.	
2	Can you tell me if commissions are included in wages for UI benefits?	
5	We had an employee worked with us for a few weeks. He had poor performance, verbally lashed out on one of the job-sites, as well as several other documented issues. We terminated him - will he be eligible for unemployment?	
1	We have some employees who have company housing. We are going to let go one of the employees go. The housing has been part of the employee compensation. How would we need to go about removing the employee from the housing? We are considering offering a severance package as well.	
4	My client is a private company in New Jersey and sent in the following question: "Actually, my director was questioning whether or not it was an HR issue to not allow Betsy the 2 weeks notice that she offered. Because we're new to this, he thought you could give us some insight on if we are responsible legally to compensate her. If she was "counting" on the 2 weeks of pay she'd be receiving - because we didn't want her to continue to come in once she gave her two weeks. I hope that makes sense." Are they responsible for paying "Betsy" the 2-weeks' rate of pay because they would not allow her to work that final period?	
6	If an employee steals from the company and we have records of such events and she is terminated from the company and due a final check. Are we able to deduct the amount that was stolen from the company on the check?	
3	Can i terminate an employee on workers compensation	
1	We will be laying off approx 7 employees out of a total of 29. Some are in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Denver, CO. Can you provide a lay-off checklist, and any other resources that may assist us? We will be providing a 2 week severance that counsel is helping us prepare. Can you provide general guidance on final paychecks, COBRA, vacation pay out, unemployment, and any other items we should be thinking about. Resources on how to manage the employees who remain, once the lay-off is concluded.	
5	We have an employee who has been with for three weeks. In the first week of work he seemed to be coming into work inebriated. He would go missing for blocks of time. We had a conversation with him regarding this and the seemed to do better the following week. This week he texted Monday, saying that he needed stitches, Tuesday he called out saying that he needed to go to doctor because he needed to get a note stating he could come back to work. On Wednesday he said be needed to see a doctor to clear concussion protocol.	
5	We have an employee who stopped showing up for work. We found out he checked himself into a rehab facility for alcohol and depression. He then applies for disability and then sends an email stating he will not be returning to work and comes and picks up his tools. Can we terminate his health coverage now or no? I have never had this situation so I don't want to do anything without checking in.	
4	Last week Friday, we processed a termination of an hourly employee within 90 days of their hire. The issue was poor job performance and time mgmt. Two managers were involved because she supported two departments. The manager was given disciplinary form, and she didn't write it well. I rewrote it and gave it back to her. She asked if the employee needed to sign the letter and I explained how it needs to be presented to her, if she doesn't sign make a note. Monday, the employee came to the office to pick up last check. I explain the check will be sent, in accordance with labor law. She asked why she was terminated. I found out the managers never presented the document. She said she was aware of the time management issues but didnt know about the performance issues. She asked for a copy of the letter and I gave her a copy of the document. I followed up with the managers and found they thought because it was within 90 days, they didn't need a form. Today the managers turned in the form with signatures. I feel uncomfortable about putting this document in the file since the employee didn't get the one with signatures.	
3	I spoke to Claudia yesterday about a situation where an employee shared with their current employer that they had intended to leave the company but would stay until the end of the year. In the best interest of the organization, they set an end date so that it was not open ended. That did not sit well w/ the employee. The employee is upset but still intends to stay until the given date but is not working in a healthy manner. It was suggested to mend the relationship to prevent any claims against the person who is communicating with the employee and/or the company. Is there anything the employees boss and/or the organization can do to protect them from potential claims outside of documenting their engagements?	
6	When employees are being terminated over the weekend, how do we cut their final check that should be given to them on their last day?	
5	An employee has not returned his FMLA Med Cert Form. It has been 17 days. May we terminate him? We have not heard anything from the employee and he has not responded to our inquiries.	
6	In California when an employee gives 2 weeks notice resignation, but suddenly in 1 week quits early to not fulfill the remaining week...when is the Final Pay Check & Stub provided/due to the employee so there's not late penalty? Thanks	
3	According to Colorado state law, are we allowed to terminate an employee if the employee continues to avoid any contact with the company after the company has tried to contact the employee on multiple occasions to determine the work status.	
3	A person just went through orientation and was training for two-three days here and they quit. They traveled from building to building for training. I usually give new hires travel pay and gas allowance. Do I have to pay this person for that or not - 4 days? Even if this is training? Does any of it fall under probationary period?	
1	If we do not want to contest an unemployment claim, how do we go about that?

6	We have an employee in California who has provided his resignation effective 10/31. When would his benefits end? If he does not return company property can we deduct that form his future commission checks? Can we provide his final paycheck via direct deposit if he consents?	
1	Can we lay someone off by phone or do we need to do it in-person?	
3	Good Morning, If an employee was hired to work 20 hours and at a later time in their employment we want to increase their hours to 30, are there any issues with us doing this?	
3	Good morning. I was wondering if you can assist in determining when someone submits a resignation, and they do not provide a week or two week notice, when would you consider coding "resigned with notice". For me, I would think if they resigned on the day they are leaving us, that would be "resign no notice" and if they provided even a day or week or two week notice that would be "resigned with notice". Can you advise your thoughts or if you have seen anything on this so we can set up a best practice if different than my thoughts? This question came up today from our admin who codes the resignations in the system and what constituted resigned with or without notice.	
4	EE in New York who the supervisor would like to terminate but having issue with the reason. The supervisor states it's due to her negative attitude and behavior. She challenges him and states she is going to take the issue to the next level. Sales performance has dropped a bit but still meeting her quota. She just called in and said she had to fly to California for a doctor's appointment and would be working remotely. We are agreeable to her working remotely. What are the risks to terminate?	
3	We have a client in Georgia looking to terminate an employee for insubordination. They are aware of the fact that the employee is gay. How can they go about this termination without it coming back to them as discrimination?	
3	I have an employee that is leaving the company. He works remotely from Arizona. Are there any special laws I need to abide by regarding terminations? Our office is in California. thanks, Melody	
4	I have a detailed employee relations issue. Would be easier to talk to someone. Issue between Nicole and Lynn tension between these two employees based on their different personalities and working style Nicole has more seniority and power user for a system. Butting heads again. Nicole was talking to another employee and advised her not to call in as Lynn would not be able to help; it was a dig. Addressed this with Nicole. One day Lynn did not turn off her computer and when Nicole came in she started using the computer that was logged in as Lynn and discovered that Lynn had a log of all of her complaints and activities of Nicole.	
5	Good morning, We suspended an employee yesterday for several reasons, as he was not meeting our expectations, and he is still within his probationary period. We extended his probationary period, and he is not understanding the work that he needs to do, as far as completing a job on his own. He also has excessive absences that we have already counseled him on previously. He has not applied the feedback we have given him. After we suspended him yesterday, he made a comment that he knows which employee complained about him not doing his work properly, and made a threatening comment if he ever sees him outside of work, and he crumbled the suspension papers I gave him and balled his fist up. He then went to a Superior authority figure and stared at them with his fist balled up. At this point, we feel he is a threat to our employees, and he does not have a stable mind to be able to work effectively at our company. Can you please provide some insight as far as us being within our termination rights? We need to terminate him when he comes back from suspension on Tuesday, but we need to make sure all our ducks are in a row, so he cannot collect unemployment from us, and so we protect ourselves.	
5	Can we terminate an employee who is on STD? Poor job performance and was spoken to about and he had several rule violations such as accessing inappropriate internet sites while at work. He knew we were terminating him. When we talked to him about the terminable offenses he mentioned his health and we decided to postpone the termination so he can go on our STD plan Is there anything prohibiting us from terminating him while on short term disability?	
1	Employees position as a claims processor has been determined to be redundant and we are considering eliminating the position. The rest of the team will take on secondary responsibilities. They are considering opening a different role which is more senior role and he is not qualified. Would this be considered discrimination? We do have a person in mind for the new position. How much time should elapse between the current person and the new offer?	
6	I have a question about final pay. First day of work was 10/10/17. Last day of work is 10/25/17. Short term assignment. Paydate is 11/3/17 for hours worked between 10/7 and 10/20. A check will be cut for the hours worked in that timeframe. His last check will be 11/17 which encompasses hours worked between 10/21 to 11/3. Employee is saying we are not complying with final pay rules. Are we ok with using the regular pay schedule? He is demanding we pay all wages on 11/3/17.

2	FSA & floating holidays Hi There, Can you please let me know the 2017 regulations for final check payout upon termination (voluntary or not) in reference to the following; * Floating pending * FSA monies due, example employee has used 500.00 of his/her 500 and upon termination he/she still owes 2 payment. Can we deduct the 100.00 owed? Thank you Happy New Year... Patricia Lee Butler Senior Human Resources Manager Long Beach.Seattle.Phoenix	
5	We have an employee who has taken some payroll advances and is to pay it back on an agreed upon schedule with every pay check. We have recently found out and have proof that this employee is stealing from us. Can we deduct the amount he owes on the payroll advances in one lump some from his termination check? His last check won't cover the whole amount, however we plan on having him sign an paper agreeing that he owes any remaining balance to us. We have not determined if we will take him to small claims court for the balance yet but most likely will. We have an employee who has several payroll advances who owes us $5,768.81, with the 5 items we continued to advance him. He was supposed to be making payments via payroll deductions, but he also had a garnishment and we couldnt take as much as we needed to or he would have fallen below minimum wage. We also just found out that he is stealing from us. He was supposed to be in San Diego all last week. We just got a vendor invoice from last week, we said called them to say that we thought was a mistake and wasnt ours. While it said John made the purchase, it had a different last name. They record all of their purchases via video, and it is clear that it was our employee that we spoke about above, purchasing another $1900 in wire in Compton, CA at a time when he was supposed to be in San Diego working. It is clear from their video that it is our employee John with a different last name than he provided making and signing for the purchase. We need to handle his final pay and terminate him, we need to know if we can make deductions.	
4	Hello, We have a wage and hour question. We had an Assistant Director (salary exempt) give notice for the 8th day of a pay period. (pay period is 1/28-2/10/17.) This Assistant Director walked out on 1/31/17 (at 10 am)ending her employment. Where she is a salary exempt employee, do we need to pay her through the 2 week regular salary, through her notice 2/8/17 or through the end of the day for 1/31/17 or time she left on 1/31/17?

2	Thank you. I understand the FSA answer. However, the Floating Holidays answer is unclear. We give employees 2 floating holidays every year in January. If the employee has not used the floating holiday, do we need to pay them upon termination for the floating holidays? Patricia Your Original Question: FSA & floating holidays Hi There, Can you please let me know the 2017 regulations for final check payout upon termination (voluntary or not) in reference to the following; * Floating pending * FSA monies due, example employee has used 500.00 of his/her 500 and upon termination he/she still owes 2 payment. Can we deduct the 100.00 owed?	
0	Thanks, so if it was accrued then yes for the floating holidays. Patricia	
3	We are changing an employee from FT to PT. Can she file for unemployment?	
5	An employee has given his 2 week notice. I asked him to turn in his final timecard. He turned in 8 hours a day for each day that he worked. Based on our volume, there is no way that he worked 8 hours each day. When I asked him, he said he was hired to work full time and even though he did not work a full day that is what he is entering on his timesheet. I asked him what he remembers working and he said he really didnt know. We pulled our service reports and could see that he only worked 4, 5, or 6 hours each day. This is a difference of about $1,000. How should I pay him?	
4	National Labor Relations Board sent us "Charge Against Employer". Basis of charge Section 8(a) subsection (1). Claimant states the Employer constructively discharged employee because she made protected concerted complaints about working conditions. We're a bit confused because the employee gave her two weeks (which we paid in lieu of notice) so she was not discharged. Can you enlighten us on what this charge means in easier to understand terms?	
3	We have a client that has an employee who walked out on them on 01/30/17. She came back the next day and ask to be terminated by the employer. Additionally, this person was in HR and it had been discovered that she was overpaying herself a few weeks ago. The employer agreed to accept payment back from the employee but restrict her from administering payroll. When the employee came back the next day asking to be terminated, she gave the employer a check for $500, which did not cover the entire overpayment of her payroll. The employer would like to have guidance as to how they should treat the termination. Secondly, how they should treat the theft issue. Thank you

We had two supervisors speak with him about complaints from co-workers and the meeting was to include a written warning, but the employee became verbally abusive with the supervisors. The supervisors requested that we put him on a three-day suspension. He requested to speak with the owner. We let him know he would not be able to speak with the owner at that time and he stormed out refusing to be put on suspension. On his way out he threatened his supervisor's life and the lives of the supervisors' family. We would like to proceed with termination.	
2	Hello, Do you have templates for individual severance agreements for 40 and under 40 years old employees? Thank you for your assistance.	
0	An employee accrues sick time weekly and for vacation it is pro-rated at .77 hours per week. Handbook states that upon separation of employment, employees will only receive 60% of unused sick/vacation. Is that legal? If you accrue it weekly then it's earned wages, correct?	
6	If an employee give 2 weeks notice that they are leaving the company and writes a resignation letter, if the company lets them go before the 2 weeks are up, do we have to give them their final paycheck right away, or can we wait until the regularly scheduled payroll?	
5	An employee put in a 2 week notice and the last couple of days he just sits there doing nothing. Can we just let him go?	
4	If an employee does not take a full 30 minute lunch (she clocked in and out voluntarily). Is she due a premium. They want to terminate her. It's not performance, they just can't stand her. "You added another duty, when am I going to get another raise?" She is not bubbly person person on the phone, but she is doing her job. We need someone with strong payroll experience. That's what we are replacing her with. The other employee we want to terminate doesn't have urgency in payroll. She decides to leave at 4:30 when she has a child to pick up. Now she is saying she has to leave at 4:30 to pick up her kids. She is fairly new and has no sense of urgency. Can I bring up the scheduling expectations in her termination letter?	
2	We have an employee who did an exit interview and wanted it to be confidential. What am I required to put in my write up to management about it?	
1	If we want to terminate someone should we give them a list of reasons why? An employee's manager wants to list each absence, tardy, performance error, etc. I think less is more.	
4	We have an employee who quit on the spot, but she has our company keys. Can we withhold her paycheck until she returns our company property?	
4	have an employee who was up for 6 month evaluation doing poorly. Before evaluation she had serious brain bleed. She came back with drs slip but just couldn't do job we completed the evaluation but it was very poor.

4	My question is we had to fire someone who is in Maryland and the unemployment office is calling me asking for one sentence of why we let her go. I just want help with this to make sure I tell them the right thing. The employee was not doing her sales job, and had not met her sales quota's for the whole year. She missed 50% of quota for most of the year and only met 25% in last quarter. Customers were complaining she was non-responsive. I was trying to explain this to the UI office and she just said I need one sentence on why the company made the decision to terminate.	
4	We have an employee who was absent from work from 1/23/17 - 1/31/17 and only left us a message that she was ill on 1/23/17. We left her messages that we need her to call asap. We never heard from her until 1/30/17. She said she had been very ill and thought everything was okay because she had a confirmation that a nurse at the hospital had sent us notification that she has a doctor's excuse until 1/31/17, We told her we did not receive this. When asked why she had not returned our calls she said she had been busy going from her home to the hospital for additional tests. She said she would bring the hopital excuse to us and I didn't receive anything. Today she sent an email with an attachment I could not open. Before her call 1/30/17 we sent her a termination letter stating job abandonment because we had not heard from her for a week. Today she called to say she had contacted unemployment and they said we could not fire her for being ill. Please advise . Thanks	
4	We have an employee that was hired by a competitor in one of our North Carolina locations. She has resigned and given us a two week notice. We are concerned that she will use her remaining two weeks to gather information from our company to take to her next company so we would like to possibly let her go early, but pay her the remainder of the two weeks. I would like to know if this is okay to ask her to stop coming in to work and cancel her access to the company systems now, or would that be considered an involuntary termination?	
1	We are in Texas so we are an "at-will" employer. Is it necessary have terminated employees sign a separation agreement?	
1	We have a new hire who is outside of his 90 days of employment who injured himself when stepping out of a truck. We are not contesting the injury,and this has been reported to our worker compensation carrier, however, he was not wearing the proper PPE. Can we terminate based on this?	
5	We have an employee who clocks in an then has been known to go home. He also has been found to be doing personal projects on company time. He has submitted his paperwork for military leave in April. Is there an added risk before of this to his termination?

1	We had an employee give 2 weeks notice today. however, we have decided to let her go now. Do we need to pay her for the 2 weeks?	
5	Unregistered User: Pastourelle, LLC. Carole Matic 646-742-2803 carole@pastourelledesign.com If an employee is claiming that he didn't get paid for vacation, but was paid regular wages, can he sue us.	
4	We have a whole department that has left to another law firm and they are taking certain staff and they are leaving one person. We do not have a position for her. We want to give her temporary work while they transition to the new employer. If she wants to do this as long as we have this temporary work and we keep her on until she finds another job. Is this a layoff? Would this be a good position for us to take?	
3	I just want to clarify the previous response I received. Is it saying we SHOULD count 72 hours from the date the employee actually quit, even though he originally gave two weeks notice?	
2	Should we be putting the reason for termination on the notice to employee form? I have heard yes and no.	
1	We have a position with a part-time employee but due to business needs we're having to increase that position to full-time. The employee cannot work more than 40 hours. What are our options? Do we need to provide notice in writing of this change?	
2	May need to terminate an employee. There has not been any behavioral issues, just performance issue over time. Documented needs for improvement and lack thereof. Now clear need to terminate. Do not feel a performance improvement plan would help at this point with as much coaching as has been given over time. Best to ask to work for a month or severance out and terminate? Can you send a severance and Progressive Discipline templates?	
1	About releasing somebody -- bringing someone in before the come off medical leave to terminate them. We have 2 sales managers. One is not performing well, we added a second position. At the time we were making the decision, he went on leave for cancer treatment. Our president was thinking about bringing him in before leave ends - I think we should wait? Any other precautions?	
6	Run payroll weekly bases. Can we issue a final check which is post dated for the normal pay day?	
3	We have an employee who is retiring and has signed a separation agreement (written for over 40) in exchange for which he will be provided a payment. His last date of employment is 10/31/17. He has asked us to defer the payment until January 2018. My research indicated it will qualify as a short-term deferral (paid within 2-1/2 months of end of calendar year in which it was earned is not considered deferred compensation). The additional information my research provided was that separation pay arrangements negotiated immediately before termination are not considered deferred compensation if paid in the same taxable year in which termination occurs or within the short-term deferral period. Do we need a new agreement if it's permissible to pay then? I want to make sure that our interpretation that making the payment to him in early January 2018 will not violate section 402(g) of the Code. I am not sure how recent the article I obtained my information from is.	
2	employee termination paperwork	
5	I have an employee who was terminated incorrectly by one of our managers. Previously we sent paperwork saying it was a no call no show, it was voluntary and the employee was not eligible for unemployment. Now we are saying it was involuntary because he was not supposed to be terminated. He is asking us for something that states this was an involuntary termination/discharge. Since this is for unemployment, should we do that or only state the dates of employment?	
5	Employee caused error of $30K. We gave him the choice to resign or be terminated. He chose to resign. We overnighted his final check to the address on file (did not ask if this was the preferred method), the next day he provided us with his new address. Do we owe penalty pay?	
3	We recently termed an employee for inappropriate behavior towards another employee . There were several documented meetings with the employee before the termination occurred in which the EE acknowledged that the behavior was inappropriate - however it continued. The termed EE sent HR an email with the subject line "wrongful termination" and in the email said that there was a hope that he could be rehired and the EE felt there had not been an opportunity for the allegations to be addressed. In the documentation it was clear that this was not the case. How or should HR respond to this EE re rehiring or the comment that there wasn't an opportunity for the termed EE's side to be heard?	
1	We have a new employee, less than one week since his start date, that we have several concerns about and would like to fire him. I would like to discuss our concerns and get your opinion. Our concerns include the following: two drug test readings that were too 'hot' to use per clinic lacking in skills to do the job fell outside the workplace, WC denied claim restrictions from doctor but no release	
5	My question is we had a terminated and employee and he filed a EEOC complaint with NY around discrimination. We have an attorney but would like to discuss	
4	We have an employee that we just hired this past Monday. It was brought to our attention that this new hire was actually a previous patient at our facility, just in a different section of our campus than the unit she was hired in. Apparently this employee was a previous resident here and would make up false allegations and our team would have to investigate the allegations and they were always false. She apparently had pysch diagnosis and was not an easy resident to deal with. In fact, our administrator stated that she would never take her back as a resident. My question is, since this employee is in her 90-day orientation period are we able to terminate her based off of this information that was just given to us? If we are able to terminate her, what would the reason be? I don't want her to sue us for wrongful termination, but we also don't want her causing problems and making up false allegations as an employee this time around.	
2	Employee was recently terminated. Within 90-days was not served termination papers. What are we required to send by state or federally?	
1	Good Afternoon! We created a separation agreement for a former employee and agreed to pay them through the end of the year. The former employee has since found a job. Are we obligated to pay them although we did not specifically say we would stop payment if other employment was found?	
1	We had an employee quit on Monday night. Our next scheduled payroll is next week. We had this individual contact us to state that we have to pay her within 72 hours. Is that correct? This is for New Hampshire.	
1	We do not provide substitute teachers with a handbook so they are not advised that we are an at-will employer. They do not offer a written offer letter either. Can we terminate a substitute for no reason without risk? Our regular teachers are given a contract.	
5	It's regarding an employee (CA) who left the company and the project he was working on was either on his home computer or somewhere on one of our servers that we can not find. I need to talk to someone to see what I am able to do.	
3	When it comes to background/reference checks, the employee signed all the necessary forms. If they sign, we are good to disclose anything that is asked. This is a reference request from another employer.	
5	We have one employee who had been absent due to physical concerns, back problems. Effecting employee performance. When no issues with back employee is overwhelmed with workload. Right now employee is on time off - not on leave. Just applied vacation. We can't accommodate him being off work. Now he said he has restrictions. Duties are lifting or sitting. We can not accommodate. We would like to discontinue employment.	
0	If an employee leaves a company is the employee entitled to their vacation pay are they entitled to only the accrual they have earned up to the time of termination?	
4	We're in Massachusetts and the employee is getting paid some severance. She asked if she could collect UI based on the severance? Severance will be paid at a couple of different times. 2 weeks after last day, 45-60 days after, and 90 days the remainder.	
4	Follow up to Oct 19 issue - I suspended the employee for 2 days, and she did not return to work after that. She did not return my calls or emails and a family member was also looking for her here at work. She finally notified her sister, who works for us, that we should mail her final check to her home address. We are considering this a voluntary resignation based on job abandonment. Just want to confirm, as I am mailing her final check today. We did not mail sooner as we were unsure of her status.	
1	With Casey on phone: We have approx 50-60 employees total, and will be laying off just 1 because the facility is vacant. Are there any laws that we must consider for a layoff of just one person?	
5	We have a nonexempt sales employee who submitted his 2 weeks notice. We have decided there's no need to have him working during the last part of the month. The manager notified him that we will not need his services beyond tomorrow. He's not sure that the employee will show up. Can we let him go this way? When is his final check due?	
4	I'm going to do a termination for a person we coached and counseled and given a final warning. One of the problems is that no one can reach her during business hours. This week she failed to post a report.	
5	HR QUESTION Hello, One of our groups, a trucking company, in Schwenksville, PA, under 20 EE, has the following two part question: PART 1: We had a question regarding an employee who has been out for a few weeks due to a broken ankle (then while being out, a few other medical issues came up). We've been providing the medical coverage for him over the last month, and not being able to deduct from his pay due to him not working, and he is not sure what his plans are for returning to work or even when. If we were to let him go, is there something we have to provide to him as far as another option for medical coverage? Or something just stating his options? Are we responsible to continue to carry his coverage? PART 2: Also, I forgot to mention, not sure if it would make any difference with the thought of letting him go, but over this time he's been out, he lost his CDL license, which his job requires it. Do you suggest we still go this route for right now rather than letting him go? We spoke with the group and advised they can offer him COBRA; however, in light of their Part 2 question that would like to know if they can let him go while out due to the injury. I await your direction. Thank you. Best regards, Lisa L.

5	I'm calling because we had RIFed some employees. They were given $1000 severance. We received a letter from one of the employees dad's demanding 25k for treating her poorly. We ignored the first letter and he sent a 2nd. Should we respond? Should we see an attorney? There was a standard reduction in force and her dad her a letter stating that he was not happen with us and he was demanding $25,000 more. I want to confirm that because he is not an attorney and not an employee.	
6	One of the people on our team is resigning. Besides the final check. What documents do I need him to sign and what documents should I give him as a handout?	
4	Fwd: Hi. Please advise re below. Thanks. R We had an employee in Ny for 9 months. She informed us she was leaving the company to move to FL She worked for us under 20 hours for week in FL telecommuting, for 6 weeks. She then quit, telling us she found another full time job. After leaving this job shortly after, we learned that she got another full time job. She left this job shortly after, I believe it was initiated by that company. After 2-3 weeks of not being unable to find another full time job, we received a request for unemployment last week. Are we responsible for paying her unemployment. Thanks so much,	
6	We have an employee who was paid on Oct. 25th for wages 1-31 informed us last day is tomorrow. They were overpaid. Would it be legal to take those funds back and then re-issue a new check. employee in CA. We would issue another direct deposit.	
2	I"m looking for guidance on how to handle a furlough at our Company. What are the legal implications in regards to pay for exempt vs. non-exempt employees. Any information that might help us that would address the pros and cons of furloughs.	
1	We have a group of employees who will be separated due to a reduction in force. We are thinking about meeting with the rest of the employee groups to discuss the RIFs . Is this common practice?	
5	I have an employee that has admitted to being hooked on uppers for the year he has been working here. He asked for a week off too clean up and get it together. Unfortunately, my business and his position is one where he can't take extended periods of time off. I don't believe he is going to a rehab facility but he has been a no call/show since Monday night when we had the conversation. His wife just texted me to explain that he is in fact at home detoxing and has had his phone off (which is why he didn't text back yesterday or today). I need to know if he can be let go for no call/show after he had already alerted me to his dependency issue.	
4	We have an employee who resigned Tuesday. Can I tell her that I will not release her check to anyone else but her? Is there anything we can do to require her to give us back her key? When are final wages due? She has 10 hours in the next pay period.	
4	We have an employee who resigned via text on Tuesday. She's requesting a letter from us stating that she resigned her position. Do I have to provide that to her?	
4	A new employee (2 weeks) is apparently not working out and on the 19th (I just found out) she had taken a child to the bathroom and everything was fine and after he went she asked him to wait for her while she went. He was left abandoned and the director just mentioned it. They also said she wasn't getting it/wasn't working out. I don't know what to say - do I focus on what happened on the 19th when I release her tomorrow? When she is told to do something, she is there in body only, not clicking. Do I want to focus on the fact she left a kid there and just not getting it or that its just not a match? I guess she was spoken to today by the Director and the owner and that HR is coming to see you tomorrow and its up to her tomorrow.	
3	The company wants to "lay off" 20 employees however there is no business rationale for a lay off and all or most of the positions will be filled. The primary reason for lay off is these employees are poor performers. Considerations?	
1	New business for us. We hired 150 for the restaurant. We have laid off some people because we over hired. One former employee filed for unemployment and stated he was laid off and wrongful termination but did not go into detail. How do I respond to the unemployment insurance claim?	
1	We are going to terminate an employee and offer an employee a severance package tomorrow. Should we have the final check prepared, with severance?	
1	We are outsourcing one of our departments. There are currently approximately 72 employees (not all full time) who will be affected. 12 will be terminated and offered severance. The remaining will be provided job offers with the new company. Does the WARN notice apply?	
5	I have a terminated employee in Colorado. He still has outstanding company issued tools. The 10th day after his termination is Sunday. Do I issue his final paycheck minus the tools today, or wait until Monday so that he has the full 10 days to return the items?	
5	For an hourly employee that shows up for orientation, they fill out their paperwork, but two hours into the orientation pretends to take a smoke break. Is he due wages? He walked off of orientation with a safety vest that is more than what he would be owed.	
4	We have an exempt employee who has advised that she will not be returning to work. She had indicated that her termination date would be the date her FMLA expires. She has 57 hours of PTO available for her payout. Would we need to pay her any additional wages?	
2	Hello, I'm new in my role and need some clarification on what an employee's separation date should actually be. Her last day will be today, but we will be granting a salary continuation through 11/10 and also benefits through the end of November. Can you please assist? Thank you.	
0	We have an exempt employee who, as per hour company policy, is paid a set amount per pay period. Unfortunately, payroll ran showing the full salary due, so she ended up getting paid an additional day that she did not work. She has accrued PTO due. an we pull from the PTO balance to cover the overpayment of one day?	
1	We have an employee in our Colorado office who are considering terminating. He is over 40 and a veteran. We are terminating him for poor performance, and I'd like to discuss our risk and the impact to our UI rates.	
1	Our medical office will be down providers, we will be over staffed with medical assistants. Can we furlough employees? How can this be done? Can it be a rolling furlough? Can staff ''volunteer for unpaid time off?	
4	We ended employment with an out of state employee. We requested she return the laptop. How long would you wait? She got final pay? Can we hold reimbursement till she returns the laptop?	
2	What is legally required to provide to an employee who has been terminated whether voluntary or involuntary?	
1	We may be eliminating 2-3 positions at our company. One of the employee's that could be effected is hearing impaired and 40 years old. In the event that we need to eliminate the position, are there any laws, rules or guidelines that we should be aware of when terminating a position and/or laying off an employee with a disability? Another employee that could be impacted is 52 years old, has anything changed with the timing when offering severance/laying off/terminating the role? The third position that may be eliminated has an employee that is 34 years old and is in a director level position. Any guidance is appreciated, Tamara Cunningham	
1	Can we legally terminate someone because no one likes them? Essentially we have someone in a managerial position that just isn't a good fit, lots of complaints, rubs everyone the wrong way - including the executive team. We can compile a list of complaints but frankly I'd like to know if there's a easier way to just say "the consensus is no one likes you -go away". He is a Caucasian adult male, 43 years of age, has been employed since June, 2017, the state is Texas And of course, we'd find a more professional way of telling him.	
4	with Michael. F/T employee whose position we will be eliminating due to a restructuring over the next few months. We are concerned that she will take this badly. She's had ongoing issues with her supervisor. Her supervisor is very strict and the supervisor has been working with her some time on her performance.	
4	I have a sit where employee has given 2 weeks last day is 31st. she originally request today to be used as a comp day. it was denied. she called out sick. Can we let her go today if she still has more sick days?	
4	We have an employee who is a nurse with us. I need some advice on disciplinary action and probable termination. The issue we are seeing is that she has had in the last four months, five incidences of lack of patient care. She had five instances where the wounds got worse. We have brought her in to speak to her about that and ask her to fix it and things have not gotten better. She got into an incident with another employee at a facility. In the confrontation, she claimed that the other nurse threatened to hurt her. We investigated and there is nothing indicating that a threat was made. We put her on paid administrative leave while we investigated. The plan is to pull her in Monday to discuss her behavior. Either she is terminated and in the future we will be forced to tell references she was terminated. The other option is that she resigns and she takes a one month severance that she will not sue us.	
6	Texas employee died. Are we able to make the check out to his mother?	
3	An employee is terminating today having given us adequate notice. We have done the final paycheck including PTO payout. Being that she is terminating today and she will not be here for the duration, it is my understanding that the PTO would be due for this pay period? In you professional opinion, I took 5 hours, that is the pay period accrual and divided by 96, multiplied by 80 (hours worked) = 4.1666. Would you agree? There is a potential for concern that when the employee returns the computer to us, what could possible be a need for action if she has wiped the machine completely or tampered with company property - how could we handle that?	
3	If an employee starts, then three days later quits and does not turn in HR paperwork (W-4) Is it the employers responsibility to call them to get that info???	
1	We are in Arizona but we have an employee NC who we are letting go and I want to verify the final pay laws.	
5	I wanted to terminate an employee. He has very poor attendance. He has 29 tardies either to work or lunch. They are other people at the facility who have 40 something tardies. I am concerned that those employees have not been disciplined. He has also had no call no shows. Our policy is three no call no shows are a job abandonment. The employee had the no call no shows October 14.	
2	Received a resignation letter today from someone on worker's comp. The date in letter states is missing. What date do we use? Not sure when was postmarked. Letter was signed by the employee on the 23rd, but does not specifically identify the date of termination. No wages due.	
1	There are some more things that have happened today and I wanted to talk about that.	
3	I have a full time employee who was here for 3 months. They were laid off from their previous job. They were receiving unemployment. They then started their job here. They were curious if they put in their two weeks here, would they be eligible for unemployment benefits?	
1	We have several commission-based employees and I had a few questions regarding payment of commission at the time of termination. Our contracts are set up so there is an Effective Date (day contract is signed) and an Activation Date (30 days after the signature when the customer is onboard). The contracts require payment within 30 days of the Activation Date. My question is: if one of our employees closed a deal on 8/31 but then quits the company before we receive payment from the new customer, are we obligated to pay the employee on the commission even though the cash is collected after he leaves? If we are obligated to pay them the commission, are we required to pay them out on their last day of employment or can we wait until collection of cash as usual?	
5	Drew Cameron dc@raylaethem.com 313-308-3207 Calling on behalf of Kathy: we have an employee who we would like to terminate. He was reported to have run a red light in one of company shuttles. He was written up at that time for the infraction. He's since been in an accident in one of our used vehicles. Our attorney did suggest that we write him up again and provide a written warning for that infraction. We want to run this past you. We really feel that he's going to be an issue.	
1	Employee has been out on STD. Was on FMLA -- exhausted leave. We have held and accommodated his leave for 26 weeks. Now we are in busy season and really need to replace this position. What can we do here?	
4	Hello, I am new to this service and left a message last Friday regarding getting some advice ahead of terminating an employee. I have not yet heard back so would prefer a phone call to talk through the situation. We are a small US operation of a global company in the UK. We have 14 employee in the US. We do not have HR presence in the US. I have a manager and we have had an issue with her ability to function as a manager and she has a child with issues and there is a lot of time away from the office. We have had multiple conversations about her communication with me and her team. When we converse it gets better and then goes back . Her one direct employee is very junior and new to the position and she has been doing the majority of the work load because and she just quit due to this .The employee brought this to my attention a few months ago. The other employee that she has a lot direct work with wants to stop doing work related to South America because she does not want to work with her. She states that she does not respond to emails or look at the numbers as other managers do. We need to take action. I have documentation going back three years. Her child had a kidney transplant and we have been extremely accommodating over the course of the last three years. When this first happened the employee that is leaving told me all of this that I was not aware of. When I have confronted her in the past she has always have good answers. I have talked to my other staff it appears that it was all cover-up. We are in Michigan. Is it better to offer some compensation to her so that we decrease our liability? 20 min Thanks, Jeff Schuster (248) 817-2101 is my direct line.

3	FW: Separation Agreement and General Release / Amy Larkin Hi Amy, This is the reply we received from the employee. I was thinking of replying as per below. Also see highlighted reply below and in red. We may agree to one more week severance but that would be it. Can we discuss? This is the paragraph that she wants to change. 1. Enos forever discharges and knowingly, voluntarily, and unconditionally releases the Company from, and forever promises not to sue the Company on, any and all claims, rights, and causes of action she now has or may have up to the date she signs this Agreement. This general release includes, but is not limited to, claims for money, demands, rights, and causes of action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Americans With Disabilities Act, as amended, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Equal Pay Act, the Georgia Equal Pay Act, the Georgia Age Discrimination Act, the Georgia Equal Employment for Persons with Disabilities Code, and claims of discrimination, harassment, retaliation, breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress, wrongful discharge, fraud, defamation, misrepresentation, emotional distress, or any other federal, state, municipal, or common-law claim relating to employment. Hi Kate, Thanks for getting back to us. We have reviewed your counteroffer and although most of your changes are acceptable; we are not in agreement regarding the separation pay. You were terminated for lack of performance. Based on your tenure (less than two years) the customarily severance is two weeks. This is an optional practice, not required in anyway. We are confused regarding your claim of Short Term Disability insurance. Mosaic sponsors Long Term Disability which is company paid. Short Term Disability is a voluntary product that would have been offered through Aflac. You are not enrolled in this product.

I met with my attorney to review the Separation Agreement and General Release. Though we feel like it is close to agreeable, I have been advised to negotiate the following terms: Paragraph 10: Non disclosure to include both parties. Will Add Indemnification for both parties Will Add Paragraph 5 section (a): compensation in the amount of 13,167.43. Not acceptable Calculated by 12 weeks salary and remaining pto in the amount of 1628.95. Agree Reasoning: Employee was separated 9 days before scheduled surgery with unknown amount of time for recovery, and management was notified of such. Assuming a time line of two weeks for recovery, which is a best case scenario, and would have been at limited physical duties upon returning, job search in limited market with aforementioned limited ability, and large possibility for necessary relocation. Short term disability insurance would have factored previously, but with an ending date of benefits being 10/31, this is no longer the case, and necessary surgery is scheduled for November 3rd. Other terms in section (a) to remain. To be direct deposited at the previously mentioned payroll cycle, minus applicable payroll taxes. Paragraph 5 section (d): Good and prompt employment reference, as was stated, as opposed to the written verbiage of "neutral". Per the Employee Handbook, Mosaic will only disclose dates and title. Separation Notice reason for termination (ie change in staffing, position retired, etc) GA Separation notice to read Layoff. Company will not contest. Any and all communication between Enos and Company to be written communication. Third party representative receipt or acknowledgement of signed contract. Per paragraph 2: Doubly, any and all evidence of such claims listed in paragraph to become null and void, and EEOC included in listed organizations or parties. NOT SURE ABOUT THIS If terms are found to be agreeable, and contract is revised, I will agree to all other terms and conditions, and will sign and submit promptly. -- Sincerely, Kate Enos (912) 322-8703 cell	
4	An employee had been counseled about her snappiness and belligerance to clients and co-workers during her performance review. We have not seen a change in her behavior, therefore, we are terminating her employment today. What documents must she receive and sign (we do not provide health benefits).

5	One of our clients employees is filing a labor law against them. He worked 3 days and had not turned in his W4 paperwork, He is now suing them for $4800- because he had not filled out the W4 He called three weeks later and the client told him that they needed the W4 to get paid. I am trying to see if the group would be fined from the date he called them regarding the check and not the start date of employment. Are you able to clarify their responsibility and the possible fines?	
4	I'm looking for your thoughts on deducting from an employee's final paycheck for time she took as PTO when she had not earned it. She has terminated and did not work long enough to earn the time. She is negative 44 hours. Can we deduct for it? She's a Massachusetts employee. She didn't disclose when hired, or even request time, that she had a pre-planned vacation. She took the time off but we allowed as a good-faith effort.	
4	We have temp employee that work at med facilities. The question is not only about payment but terming an employee. Employee did not turn in time sheet or never came to pick up check. Now it looks like she never actually worked. The facility has no record of her showing up not on the schedule. No response from employee. She was a no-call no show. Sept 17th was shift. Is it job abandonment? We can not get a hold of her. Still have the check. Thinking I should send certified letter? The check we have for her is only for the hours she never actually worked. I don't want her to come back and say you told me you had a check. NY state in a protected class. She originally responded and said she lost the timecard. We kept chasing her for the time sheet, we talked to you and we called her to come pick up the check. No response for a month and a half. We have 45-day billing window with clients. We asked the facility to confirm the time - they stated they cancelled the shift, but we have no proof, but they have no record of her logging into anything. She was either mistaken or lying. This was her last chance to work a shift for us. Should I do a certified letter stating she has not acknowledged after multiple attempts who confirmed she did not work? We told her there was check... What is the risk if we don't pay?

1	Sorry, I hit "submit" too quickly! If we want to have a one month season shut down of our company, and essentially lay off some entire departments of employees for just one month, are there any requirements/procedures/laws we should be aware of? We plan on re-hiring most of these folks back after the one month period, but not all of them necessarily. Thank you!

5	We will be laying off an employee in CA. Can we discuss the separation documents we must provide? We have a TPA for our COBRA. He earns commissions and we may pay him commissions on a pending sale if he meets certain conditions. Is that permissible? We are providing him with a severance agreement and that includes that he returns company property. We will give him our Fed Ex number to ship back. He is remote, we will have our conversation via telephone. I will send him the CA UI booklet, HIPP Notice, Change in Relationship form, and we are wiring his wages to his bank account. Any other items we should consider?

He will be in jail until 11/6/17. He has history of disruptions at work and for weeks now there has been talk about terminating him, but client unsure if they legally could. He has been suspected of coming to work under the influence of alcohol, but never written up for it. In the past, client has worked with employees that have been under house arrest or in jail, allowing a Huber situation, but not sure management will want to in this case. What are they legally able to do if they want to terminate his employment?	
2	Hi there - Do you have any materials around creating a severance package methodology? As in, 1 week for every year of service and reasoning behind that? What are the options when someone tries to negotiate severance? Could it be considered discriminatory to offer one person more than another based on the situation? Thanks, Wesley

4	We are laying off a staff person due to the end of a grant funded position. However, we have another person leaving and we would like to offer her this position; it would be a lateral move and we verbally offered her the position, which she said did not meet her professional goals.

4	I am considering terminating an employee. She has had a couple of no-call/no-shows of 2 days. She leaves the retail shop without coverage (and she's a manager). She said she needed hours following her sister's passing but failed to show up the next 2-3 days. We ended up processing those days as bereavement. We just find ourselves extending her employment although any one of these situations could have ended in termination. Part of it is that her boss was not documenting the absences or her leaving while scheduled. Can we terminate?	
5	An employee suffered a spider bite and we are handling it as a WC claim although we are not sure whether the spider bite happened at work or not. Our carrier is investigating. In the meantime, management would like to terminate the employee because he has been late 6x since his date of hire in May and he has not completed some of his projects.

He has been off work, just based on his schedule, and when he returned to work today, he said he was going to see a doctor just because he thought he should.

When I pulled her paperwork, she did not include her direct deposit information and I called her multiple times to explain I needed her direct deposit information and she responded multiple times please process a manual check and mail it to me over and over and I need her bank information to start the check process. I want to give her final check. I don't know how to set her up in the system to withhold the proper deductions. The mode to create the check requires the bank information.

3	I have a question about unemployment insurance. We have temporary workers and try to work only 29 days then not employee them so no unemployment. How long do they have to be off work to be able to put them back on again so no unemployment? We're a homeless shelter. The guests that stay with us have the opportunity to work. We try not to have them employed long enough that they can go out and collect unemployment, that's what we are trying to avoid. A couple guys are outstanding workers. Can I reemploy them and not run into the unemployment situation again?

5	We had an employee quit on Monday, May 1st. Usually we deduct health insurance premiums for the month. He is a sales rep. If he worked, we would double up on premiums for the month. May 1st is his quit date. Even though he quit on May 1st, he didnt really perform work on that day. He is a salesman, on salary and is exempt. He is commission based. For Monday, I wouldnt need to pay him the full commission day, only minimum wage for 8 hours. We need to know if we would process his termination as of May 1st or April 30th.

Just learned today, there is a picture of employees the day they were terminated, picture of the group flipping the finger, #severance! Picture posted on Instagram. Non-disparagement agreement, every person in the photo. 1. Do we proceed with terminating the individuals we just rehired? 2. Do we send a letter to the rest and tell them we don't want to pay the rest of severance?	
4	Regarding an upcoming termination of an assistant teacher. we are wondering the best way to approach this. They have only been here since Sept. Her performance is lacking. They are not going to renew her contract. She had a workers' comp claim and disability claim so we need to tread carefully. I want to make sure there is no retaliation claim and this is strictly due to performance issues. Is this just as easy as saying we are not renewing the contract for next year since we are an at-will employer? Or do we need a different approach? We are looking for documentation that may be in email. With at-will employment, can it just be a simple thing that we are not renewing the contract? The workers' compensation injury was in September - she missed about 2 days. There was a disability - she went out in December through spring break (about 3 months). She did not qualify for FMLA/CFRA - she was just hired in September. She was cleared - no limitations.	
6	When an employee terminates in their 90-day probationary period, do we have to pay them their accrued vacation time.

5	We had a complaint against the manager. The employee was worried about retaliation. He was on the verge of termination prior to the complaint. The manager does not know who the complaint came from. The manager now wants to fire the individual without knowing who complained. He is assigned people to work with him and they have complained and nobody want to work with him. How can we proceed and be in compliance? The manager has counseled the complainant before and is to recommending. They indicated that the manager drinks on the job. The manager did drink on the job and we do not have a policy about this. We disciplined them and let them know that if they do this again it will lead to termination.

If she asks, can I say we automatically terminated his employment?	
4	We have a three day no call no show policy. An employee called in on Wednesday last week and let the supervisor know that she was in the hospital. She did not call in on Thursday, Friday (scheduled overtime), Saturday (scheduled overtime) or Monday. She called in today to ask if she could return to work tomorrow. The supervisor had already sent an e-mail stating that she had not heard from her. I spoke to the employee and told her that not calling in for three consecutive days is considered job abandonment. She is very upset and said that someone just wants to get rid of her and mentioned several times that she has a medical condition. I told her that I would speak to management, but at this point I wasn't sure if anything could be done because she didn't call in to her supervisor for three days. She said that she called in to the shop foreman assistant and she couldn't remember the date. Then her mom called and told me that the employee called in on Thursday. What can we do at this point? UPDATE The employee is not eligible for FMLA. She was in the hospital - she was diagnosed with MD. She was hired in January. Does this change your guidance?

5	I was hoping a rep could call me. My questions is quite long. My number is 207-458-1120. Thank you. Victoria Watkins We had a gentleman who quit without notice. He quit Sunday and asked for Monday and Tuesday off. He told us he would call off sick. He did for Tuesday and Wednesday then quit Thursday. He was moving and decided he needed a couple days off to move. We couldn't give it to him, we had already provided time off to others. We had no coverage. He said in his text he would just call in sick and that is what he did. What should I put in the letter? Do I need to send a letter? He was texting his supervisor. One of the last texts was "consider this that I quit."	
5	I'm working on a termination. We did not have enough work for employees. One employee never responded to our attempts to speak with him. Eventually he did answer and notified that he had been hospitalized. I told him we'd need a doctor's release. I advised him to contact his manager for his next assignment. Another couple of weeks have passed and we have not heard from him. We would like to terminate for lack of contact and we think the story he gave us is a lie. What are your thoughts?	
2	We have a former employee contact us, demanding we present a service letter and/or letter of separation. He is stating this is required under law. Can you confirm if we are obligated to extend a notice of termination in written form in Michigan?	
3	Rules are that a company can elect to pay "actual hours worked" on the first and last week worked for an exempt employee. An exempt employee worked 56 actual hours the last week -they were paid 40 regular hours, not 56 hours due to their exempt status. Is this correct to pay only 40 or should they be paid 56 hours even though classified as salaried exempt. Thanks	
3	What do I do when an employee calls in and quits on the spot and provides no notice? As an employer what do I need to note in their personnel file? or provide to them? We are a company with 45 eligible employees. Any advice would be appreciated	
1	Follow up to previous issue: We have under 50 employees, therefore, not covered under the FMLA. The reasons for the employee leaving is because of her child's behavioral problems, chronic runaway. This is disruptive to our business and her excessive absences and leaving work early without providing notice can no longer be permitted. We are going to terminate. Risks?

1	We are a manufacturer and we run background checks on all new hires after they start working.

5	We have been dealing with tardiness and have done everything we can to help. Its been going on for a couple of months. He's been written up and he was late again and we gave a final warning. He signed it. Today he called his supervisor at 8:29 (he starts at 8:30). She stated she was going to report the tardy and he said "well I am calling out then." I called and told him we would have to terminate him and he stated "I was trying to save my job." He can't drop off his son until 7:50 a.m. Sometimes "i have a problem with my son, he doesn't want me to leave." His biggest reason is because of his son. Do I need to send a little. The son is in his first year of school. I feel we have dotted our "Is" and crossed our "Ts" and when I talked to UI they said this could be a sticky wicket. Should I send a letter or just leave it be? He was witnessed in the parking lot at 8:37 and just sat out there - they don't know why. He can't say he called out.	
3	I have a client who is a small company in Texas. They have an employee who advised he would be out for jury duty on Monday 5/1, and then called in on Tuesday 5/2 to resign.

5	Today somebody else came in to my office and the shipping officer smelled like alcohol. I tried to observe it myself, and he did smell like alcohol. I asked him to come in to my office, I asked if he was drinking and he said no and would be willing to be tested. We went to the clinic and he tested positive but below the limit.

It also indicates we may send employees to reasonable suspicion drug testing.

5	Termination Email Hello, I am looking for some help with drafting a letter to terminate an employee who is an instructor for group fitness classes for my company, Triple Knockout, doing business as iLoveKickboxing in Orland Park, IL. The employee needs to be terminated for a number of reasons: arriving late numerous times (after being verbally warned and written up previously), complaints from members about his vulgar music in class, complaints from members about his classes not being good, complaints from members overhearing him talk about his partying and drinking (especially bad since we preach health and wellness and are supposed to be role models for members trying to live a healthier and more fit lifestyle), complaints from other employees about his work performance, and mistakes being made with work tasks. I issued a verbal warning to this employee on September 19th, 2017 stating if he makes any other mistakes in our POS system, Rainmaker, or has any error with payments (writing a membership agreement form for new members signing up on a membership), or has other issues arise, it will result in a write-up. More mistakes were made after the verbal warning was issued, so I wrote him up and had him sign the employee warning notice form (I have the signed copy in my records). After being verbally warned and written up, he then arrived a couple minutes late to his shift this past Saturday and arrived late again on his shift on Sunday. He told me that he arrived early to his shift on Sunday but punched into his time clock late. I know this is a lie because I have time stamped texts from the other instructor scheduled to work with him that morning wondering where he was at. Because his Sunday shift was in the morning when classes first start, members were waiting at the door to get into the studio and the other instructor was waiting for him to open up the door since she did not have a key since that was her first day on the job. Additionally, I received complaints from two separate instructors today about how his job performance is bad (bad classes, inappropriate music still being played, and member complaints they are hearing about him). Due to his most recent late arrivals to work and additional complaints from instructors, I need to terminate his employment. I would like to send him an email, so everything is in writing. Are you able to help draft a letter to terminate his employment based on the facts stated in this email? Thank you, Joe Johnson Owner, Store Manager 708-256-0837	
3	I have a client who is a seasonal employer in Massachusetts. They are going to have some layoffs in the coming weeks. They have asked what the percentage is for unemployment. We are also looking for some general information regarding the layoff process.	
5	Employee was hired about 3 weeks ago, but manager feels he is "not a good fit." Having a personality conflict, coming in late, leaving early, taking long lunches, while others on the team do not do that. Lack of attention to detail. Minimal documentation other than an email regarding his attendance, and today he actually showed up early. I think we should coach him but management wants to terminate him. They are purchasing equipment that would eliminate his position, so considering lay off. Thoughts?	
1	In TN may we terminate an employee for a social media post? In our situation, an employee made a harassing post online to a personal enemy. That person then had all her friends write negative reviews and posts on facebook, yelp, and other rating sites. Since then our rating has dropped from 5 to 4.7 - a significant drop in such a small period of time which might affect business especially if these negative posts are allowed to remain about our company.	
2	Can you send me information on final pay requirements in California?	
1	We had an employee walk out of the job and prior to doing so used a lot of profanity toward another employee. We want to send a letter stating that the termination is final.	
6	An employee is terminated, so we owe him final wages within 24 hours. In the meantime, his usual DD for the past pay period will hit a few days later. Must I stop his DD and issue him a live check for those wages?	
5	HI, We have a situation in which we had dismissed an employee for numerous times of not reporting to work without notifying the President of Construction. The president of construction had requested during his absence to please call him and let him know what was going on. The former employee had been given notice he must notify the President of Construction if he missed again prior to the last time. This employee had missed 6 times multiple days without notice in a 11 month time frame. Now the former employee is indicating we prevented him from receiving a job due to his termination. The former employee has request one of the partners to write a letter on his behalf. Needless to say, we would prefer not to write a letter. How should we handle this? Thank you, Debbie Grant Cityscape Residential Administrative Manager

1	When are commissions due in California? An employee resigned and provided 2 weeks. Do we need to pay commissions that we have not received payment on yet?	
1	From : kara@mp-staffing.com Subject : Thanks for the response. I have a follow up question. If we choose to take the risk and not pay as we truly have no indication that she did work, nor have had any response from her, what is the risk for us. If there was a judgment against us, what are we risking just the wages or is there more? Thanks, Kara	
2	We have to confidentially release an employee. Forms required? What to say?

5	We have a new hire that just started today. He is going through orientation. He was 45 minutes late due to poor planning. He stated he did not anticipate traffic would be so bad. During orientation he disengaged and then he took a break between meetings arriving late again. What are your thoughts on terminating?	
3	We had some EE who left our employment and we didn't have all info to pay them for 10/16-10/31. I need to pay them. this will be their last check. They had benefits that I would have taken out of last check? Can I still take those out of their check? Employee in Missouri. These people were placed on administrative leave. 2 of them called on 10/17 and resigned. I owe them 16 hours pay for 10/16-10/31. When I went to pay them, one employee's benefits is not covered by the 16 hours. The employees are exempt. How would you feel if they say pay the vacation pay , they were paid the auto allowance for October but you quit - do we have a right to take back those monies for the days they do not work? What is the Missouri minimum wage? I can't go below the minimum wage times 40 hours?	
1	Employee in CA, being let go today. The person who will be notifying him is on a flight to CA right now. Can we give him the 27 page EDD pamphlet online? The form for change of relationship, does that need to be handed to him? Who should sign it, some of the lines don't pertain to the situation, can I leave blank?	
4	We're thinking of letting someone go. We have 1-2 employees who have disclosed that she's part of the reason they resigned. She works too slow, her performance is poor. I disagree with the decision to terminate because their are no write-ups, she won employee of the month on Oct. 1st and she's currently on vacation. The owner wants to terminate tomorrow morning because that will allow us to pay out just the vacation days that she had accrued. What are your thoughts?	
5	We have an employee that just started about three weeks ago. He has missed three days this week due to a car accident. He is unable to make it to work due to transportation issues and he has had doctor's appointments. He has called in all three days to let us know that he was not going to be able to make it in. The supervisor would like to terminate him due to missing too much training. Do you see any issues with this?	
5	We had an employee pass away last night at home. His brother in law is calling; left a message with our front desk to inquire about his belongings and his insurance information. The employee listed his sister as a beneficiary for any benefits (i.e. life insurance, 401(k), etc.). Should we release information to him? We processed payroll yesterday and it was through this week and it was direct deposited yesterday so we're set in that regard. He hasn't worked any hours since then.	
3	Submitted by unregistered user Amber asked to log under Dana: A company is being sold to another company. They're being sold - they are a semi-monthly payroll 1-15th. The company is being sold as of the 5th. She is trying to calculate PTO amounts and she is having trouble calculating it. Is she allowed to zero out the paycheck stub balances on the final payroll. It is a per pay period accrue for a salaried employee. Legally what should the employees get? Are they required to prorate? Would you divide by workdays as opposed to calendar days?	
4	We hired director of mental health in August. We're considering terminating her for several reasons including: tardiness every day for the first month, inappropriate comments to young patients/students (age 0-5) about actions that can lead them to juvenile detention, missing teacher meetings, not taking accountability, and general need for hand-holding. We would not expect this from someone of her level. The only action that has been corrected to some point is her attendance. What reason do you think this falls under?	
4	Brooke (not registered) 415-845-1211 brooksley@andyslocalmarket.com I have an employee who went out. Left shift before it was over and said she would be back on her next shift. Sunday she txt and said she would not be in. She was going to be admitted to community hospital and she would let me know when clear to return to work. That was Sunday the 22. Weds the 25th she txt and said she was released and she would call the 26th but she never call on the 26th. 31st she said she would come in today with a note that is backdated to the 25th. I considered job abandonment. I hired someone to fill positions.	
1	We are terminating an employee and I want to verify the following: We hired him on Sept 1 and we want to exercise the 90 day right that we have and we have provided him with a lot of feedback and he is creating a production hardship. I am writing a letter day letter him. I no sure if I can just let him go or if I have to give a certain amount of notice?	
3	Do you have an employment check list if the group was going through a reorganization and they need to layoff 100 employees? They have 400 employees. They are in California.	
5	I'm calling regarding an incident - we are doing a lay off of an employee who we told yesterday (layoff on Friday) and we would let them work the full week. This gentleman called in sick today because he has sick time available. He told his supervisor he would be out the next 2 days. Can we let him go today. Please send response to irene@arisesolar.com Irene is our director and asked me to call.	
2	Is the social security number required on the Notice of Change in Relationship form? 310-297-9419	
1	We are going to terminate an employee we sent a request for a meeting and she has not responded how should we proceed?	
1	We are thinking of laying off 3 or 4 people due to performance and we are closing a facility. Ho can we be in compliance? Does WARN apply? Will this affect our employees? Do discharges and resignations count towards WARN? The employees are in Texas.	
0	Do employers need to pay out vacation accruals to employees in Oregon and Massachusetts at termination?	
5	We have an employee who filed an unemployment claim and indicated that the germs in the work environment caused a medical condition that the employer knew about. However, the employee had resigned for personal reasons. He never indicated that he needed any accommodation from us. In addition, the medical condition he disclosed to us could not have been caused by germs. Can we disclose in our response to the claim what the medical condition is?	
1	We operate a bakery and we have a early morning shift, morning shift, PM and graveyard. There are only 4 employees on the graveyard shift. The manager let the team know. The employees were asked what they are willing to do the other shift - are there times I need to be concerned about? Age and timing? We have other shifts they can move to.	
4	Follow up to today's earlier issue: We just learned that the employee was using her own computer while working for us. How can we get our company information off her computer?	
5	Question from a client: I have a question, were just not real sure how to handle. We have an employee that was hired as a welder on 8/25/17 and went through our orientation and safety orientation. During his shift on 10/4 he got a metal flake in his eye due to not having his safety glasses on his eyes but on top of his head. We didnt at the time terminate his employment, even though we should have. His scheduled release to return to work is 12/26/17. What are your thoughts on this, since hes still in his 90-day probationary period, but when he comes back to work he will not be.	
4	An employee was terminated yesterday for cause. She had been on a PIP, and came in after lunch yesterday highly intoxicated. She fell as she came out of the elevator and several employees had to help her get up and to her desk. We fired her for intoxication. Under NY law, what forms must we provide to her? She is well over 40 y.o., and had been on medical leave earlier this year for skin cancer, which is now gone. Any additional risks?	
2	I am planning to let someone go today. What documents are required for termination?	
1	We are going through downsizing - laid off three EE on Monday - Pennsylvania - manage had been doing interviews - hired one person - starts on November 6th.	
3	IF an employee is out on a medical leave and has exhausted their FMLA in full, and they have not communicated at all, did they abandon their job? Can we terminate them? They also filed a worker comp claim before they went out.

5	I have an employee who was here not too long, last day was Oct 20th he did not report to work on the 23rd he said he was going to be in NY for the week. He has company credit card, phone and charger for the company. He never showed up Monday. We are not able to get a hold of him. Would like some guidance on composing a letter. Rhode Island	
5	We have an issue with an individual and wanted to terminate him on subordination. The individual has been with us for 9 months. There is a language barrier. I don't know if its the language barrier but he is not meetings project goals. He is not asking the questions he needs to ask. Just recently we had an incident where he was asked to leave an executive's office and he got confrontational. He's failing to meet job expectation standards. He is bothering people with his feelings about the company. People have asked him not to disrupt them and he continues to do it.	
1	We publish a month magazine and have two FT staff writers. We want to transition them out of the company. They have worked here for 3 years, and are very slow. The new editor believes we can bring in others who can write more efficiently and meet our style standards. We want to support the editor so that they are not burdened with too much and get burnt out.	
3	What are the consequences for an employee falsifying their timecard for the past two months? Management will be meeting with this employee today at 1:00, if you are able to get back to me before then that would be great :)	
4	If an employee has heard or feels that they are going to terminated, and they have been calling in sick. She texts her supervisor and says if you are going to terminate me just do it over phone. I don't feel that this is professional and we would like her to come into work for that meeting.	
1	We are planning to terminate everyone in a particular department. there are 4 of them and the termination reason is because they as a team are failing to complete the job in a timely manner and it is effecting the business. We would like to hold a meeting for the 4 of them together and terminate them all at the same time. Is there any liability/risk in doing that? Do we have to do it individually instead?	
1	For terminations. If we have an employee that has company equipment, are we allowed to hold their check until we get that back?	
1	We had an employee that was terminated on Monday - due to no call, no show. We found out the individual was in jail and will not be released until the end of month. We issued uniforms and are unsure if these will be returned, or in a decent condition per our company property policy. May be reduce final wages to recover the cost?	
3	If an employee has put in two weeks notice for resignation, and the employer accepts the resignation, can the employer then enforce this should the employee change their mind about the resignation?	
3	If a large, private-sector Illinois employer implements a furlough, would an employee be eligible for unemployment benefits?	
2	Transitioning from temporary layoff to permanent layoff/termination	
1	We are releasing an employee in California, as they are simply not a good fit. We promised a bonus of $120K, which is payable in July, which is forfeited if termination is for cause. Do we have to pay this, and if so - is this included with final wages?	
2	Transitioning from temporary layoff to permanent layoff/termination _____ Our Response: We are not sure of your exact question but assuming the question the steps to take when terminating an employee: Below are some areas to consider when determining whether to lay off employees or to conduct a reduction in force: Lay off versus Reduction in Force Determine if it is a lay off or reduction in force. Lay off gives the impression to the employee the time off from work is temporary and they will be recalled back to work when business picks up. Lay off termination is typically used in a union environment where employees are guaranteed are return spot when business picks up. Reduction in force is a permanent cut to the headcount. In a reduction in force the employee are separated from the employer and paid out all wages. Business Need Identify the business reason for the reduction in force and be able to articulate it to the affected employees. Selection Criteria What is the selection criteria for affected employees? Performance, tenure with company, skill set? Be sure the selection criteria is fair and there is necessary documentation to support your position. Other Potential Risks Review affected employees. Are any of them a minority, disabled, or over 40 years old? Have any of the affected employees recently filed workers compensation claims or lawsuits against the company? Any recent claims regarding harassment? Below is a resource from Comply which has a sample of a Reduction in Force letter: https://thinkhrcomply.com/ReferenceHome/ManagingEmployees/Termination/TerminationToolkit _____ Severance Agreements and Workers Over Age 40 Under the Older Workers' Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA), many procedural requirements must be satisfied before an employee's release or waiver of federal age discrimination claims will be considered enforceable. Releases waiving claims or rights under the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) must be knowingly and voluntarily executed, and the following must occur: * The waiver must be written in easily understandable terms. * The waiver must specifically refer to rights and claims existing under the ADEA. * The waiver cannot extend to rights or claims that may arise after the date the release is executed. * The consideration offered in return for the waiver must be unrelated and in addition to whatever the individual is entitled to upon termination under existing company policies. For example, if company policy provides for the payment of accrued but unused vacation days upon termination, such sums are not additional consideration capable of supporting a waiver of ADEA rights and claims. * The individual must be advised in writing of their right to consult with legal counsel prior to executing the release. If the individual considering the waiver has not filed any administrative charges of age discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), or a lawsuit alleging a violation of the ADEA, the following notice requirements must be observed: * The individual must be given at least 45 days to consider the release. (Note: In individual termination situations where no EEOC charge or ADEA lawsuit has been filed, the employee must be allowed to consider the release for 21 days, and afforded an additional 7 days after execution to revoke the agreement if desired.) * The company must notify the individual, in easily understandable written terms, of any eligibility requirements for participating in the employment termination program and all time limits applicable to the program. * The individual must also be informed, in easily understandable written terms, of the job titles and ages of all individuals who are eligible or being selected for the termination program, and the ages of all individuals in the same job classification or organizational unit who are ineligible or not being selected for the program. If the individual has filed an age discrimination charge with the EEOC, or a lawsuit alleging a violation of the ADEA, the company must provide the individual with a reasonable period of time to consider the execution of a waiver of ADEA rights and claims. An individual cannot waive their right to file a discrimination charge with the EEOC, or to participate in an EEOC investigation. We strongly encourage you speak with legal counsel to understand the risks in separating these employees. Please note that the information provided herein is practical HR, not legal advice.

0	Our employees earn vacation based on accrual. They earn 5 or 10 days per year based on time with the company. If we allow an EE to 'advance' on his earned vacation hours, can we then deduct those advanced vacation wages if he ends up leaving our employment prior to when the vac hours would have been earned? Example: Joe receives an advance of 50% of his accrued vac in Feb. In April, he decides to leave the company. Normally, at this point he would have only earned 25% of his accrual. Can we then deduct the other 25% of vac. hours that were in effect not earned? Thank you, Betty	
3	Two employees are boyfriend & girlfriend. When one calls off, the other one does too. Neither has been at work since Monday. We had to call them to ask if they are coming in Tue, Wed, Thur. They would then call us back later and say that they were not coming in because they were not feeling well. Additionally, the female employee is on her final notice due to performance, and the male employee has violated federal law by illegally shipping a product without proper procedure, and we are a federal contractor. I want to terminate both, but I do not want to pay UI. How to manage?	
6	Follow up to previous issue: If an EE separates, can we notify them that thier final check will be available at the corporate office? We are losing company assets because final checks are often DD.	
4	One of our employees is continually violating company policy by taking dogs home with her or to a fiend's house (we are a dog walking company). She has been told about this and continues to do so. We want to terminate her. Must I suspend her first? Will she be eligible for UI?

4	We have a medical director who is a certified medical assistant. This past November she broke with medical protocol and used the same needle for collecting blood from a patient on different arms. A breach of this nature could put us at risk of a law suit. We wrote her up as part of our progressive disciplinary process and made it clear that another offense of this nature would result in termination. Yesterday, she had two unmarked syringe needles filled with medication which she was carrying to a patient. The needles were capped but unmarked. This was also a breach which could have resulted in a law suit. We would like to proceed with the termination. Prior to terminating her employment we will be discussing this with our attorney.

5	We had an employee come in last week complaining that he had hurt his ankle in a skying accident. I told him to go see a doctor and to get a note that we could accommodate and restriction or a leave, but that we would need a doctors note. The employee called out the next two days and then was no call no show until today. We attempted to contact him everyday he was no call no show to remind him to provide the note and check on his welfare. WE had chosen to proceed with termination under our no call no show policy. Today he showed up to work. We had no note from the doctor to cover the time on "leave" for the ankle injury, nor was he schedule to work today. We still wish to proceed with termination, should we pay him for coming today. What about tomorrow when we asked him to come back in to speak with HR?	
4	We have an employee who is not performing to expectation. She is having performance issues and making mistakes. She's been with us less than 90 days and has been talked to about her performance. She is a female, under 40, and of Indian descent. As long as we ensure that we can show the termination reason is based upon her performance, we should be okay to terminate, correct?

1	We are employer based in CA and we had employee out on disability since Sept. We could no longer hold his position anymore so we decided to let him go. I was wondering, are there any documents that we need to provide the employee for involuntary termination? Also, are there any templates that you have that I can use to help create a termination letter? Are there any other legal docs that we need to be aware of or send him?

5	Termination - contesting unemployment. Development director, in charge of social media fund raising campaign, made an error when he went to post a personal opinion on his own social media and mistakenly put it on our organizations social media page. This had a direct detrimental effect on the fundraising campaign and several donors dropped out because of his comments. I'm looking for help in how to respond to the unemployment claim.

5	I have a driver that is part of our DOT drug testing pool. He was sent to drug test and while he was on his shift, he sent a text to his manager saying he was sad it had to end that way and he would return his equipment.

1	Felix- Owner We have an employee you is 72 years old. The employee has been involved in approximately five vehicle accidents over the last several years. We are considering termination. We are looking for a legal opinion on whether or not we can terminate this employee.	
1	After we terminate an employee the next payday we mail their check. It is our policy. We are located in Virginia. We confirm their address and if there is a change of address, we ask for that. An employee states she has a lawyer and wants to pick up the final check. People come in and they cause a big scene and we don't want them in the building anymore. The checks are already in the mail, so the former employee cannot come in and pick it up - this is our policy.	
3	I'm terminating an employee for falsifying his time sheet and lying to our client. How can I word the termination letter so that he is not eligible for unemployment benefits?

This was written on the request form in red by the manager. The employee returned his uniforms and left which we thought was strange. The employee has not shown up and the manager has been calling him everyday. Can we terminate?	
3	It's a question with a Workers' Comp and ADA regarding an employee in CA	
4	We are in the process of terminating an employee and want to make sure that we are doing it to the best standards. I know that I have to have a paycheck within 24 hour. This person is not scheduled to work until next Friday. I do not feel comfortable having her just to come in to terminate her. She comes in next Friday and has not worked since last week. I wrote up a disciplinary letter using a page in our handbook and sited her violations. She has never had any formal written warning but had some verbal conversations with her. She is becoming difficult to work with: unable to focus on her job, she cannot help others and cannot help other co-workers (she is a medical assistant). This was to be temporary position	
5	An employee resigned and was provided with a severance. He lives and works in TX, we are in CA. When should he receive his final wages and accrued vacation? His severance has already been signed, but he has now moved from TX to SC. How do we tax his severance pay? His severance pay will be distributed over the next 4 pay periods through Dec 31. Must I register for income tax in SC?	
5	We have an employee who voluntarily left on October 12 on good terms. We paid bonuses on November 1. He is claiming he should have been paid this bonus because he worked the bonus period. Our CEO says he wasn't here on November 1 when it paid out so he doesn't get it. We do not have a policy that states you must be here to be paid and it was only a couple of weeks. I am concerned this could create some exposure as he is a in a couple of protected classes he is a 60 year old gay man.	
5	This is a follow up to an issue previously where we had an employee whom we allowed to resign. We gave him a modest severance package, and he signed an agreement. He subsequently filed for unemployment benefits, which we successfully contested. He is now appealing this decision for unemployment. I am being asked if we should now provide a copy of the severance agreement with the state t support our case. Also, the former employee went on glassdoor.com and slandered the company. We are sending him a letter stating that he will need to remove this from social media. Would that action have any impact on his unemployment claim?	
4	I had to let go two employees on Saturday. One has been working for 4 months part-time. She has been coming late and has consistently called off on Saturdays at the last minute before her shift. We have this documented. Is this sufficient? Another employee has been with us for a few months as well. She was pushing for a promotion to manager. We promoted to assistant manager, but she was looking for higher pay. When advised this would not happen, she wanted to go back to a stylist. She then had attendance issues, and called of on Saturdays (our busiest day). It was also reported that she was at work after smoking marijuana. She was also bath mouthing the company. She called off on Saturday stating she had to take her brother to the hospital. When asked for anything to show this she advised she did not have it so we terminated. She came in after hours using her key to get her license, and left the key at the register. Also, a former employee has come to me to have a form completed for county services. She has asked me to email this to the agency. I have never seen this before.	
1	We have an employee who we had decided to terminate due to job related performance issues. This had been discussed and the informal decision was made a couple of weeks ago to terminate. She has now advised this week that she will need to take a medical leave of absence for knee surgery. Can we still terminate? What is the risk? We have fewer than 50 employees, so there is no FMLA involved.	
2	Doing an exit interview. I don't want them to take clients with them. I'm not sure what documents they need to sign. Confidentiality agreement for exit interview?	
4	Client question: Employee was recently given the option to resign or be terminated. She resigned then called three days later and rescinded her resignation and told the employer the the employer would need to involuntarily terminate her. She requested a copy of all her corrective actions, etc. from her personnel file and a copy of the termination letter which was torn up in the termination meeting on the day she resigned. Is the employer required to provide an employee a copy of her personnel file?	
6	Final paycheck from May employee did not pick up and when spoken to asked the employer to mail; employer mailed to employee's address on file however it was returned when employer check address there was an error and corrected the address and resent the check however it was returned again and the employee is not returning phone calls.	
5	We had an employee resign in the winter of 2017. He was granted unemployment because the investigation determined he was mentally unable to perform the work. He was employed for a short time and we're getting unemployment statements again. Would it make sense for us to inquire if this is actually a disability claim instead of unemployment?	
2	Is there a sample termination letter I could use as reference for an involuntary termination due to conduct and performance?	
4	Temp to hire from an agency about three months was offered a position two weeks ago however she did not begin regular employment as she is still in the agency conversion period. Unfortunately since the offer was given she has not performed well and has been uncooperative For instance, she and other employees are allowed to telecommute unless there are computer problems. On a day there were computer problems she was called in and said she wouldn't come in until until noon and didn't arrive until 2P; her productivity has dropped and she reported hours on the time sheet that were not worked (acknowledging so to the Lead). The employer wants to rescind the job offer based on the decline in her performance and for fraudulently reporting time that she did not work. Considerations.	
5	We have an employee that we want to terminate who has reported to work unfit for duty on multiple occasions. During his second to last offense, he was placed on a "last and final" written warning and notified that if he arrived to work unfit for duty again, he would be terminated. Since the last incident where we would immediately terminate him, he has not reported back to work nor returned any phone calls we have placed to get a hold of him. Can we notify him of his termination via US Postal Mail at this time? Can you provide any sample termination notices for this circumstance?	
4	Employee has had performance issues, making mistakes and possibly "fudging" the dates on reports. She was counseled last Wed and disclosed that she has been taking meds and they were affecting her performance. She stated that as of last Wed, the meds are now adjusted, and when asked, she said she needs no type of accommodation. Manager has found additional mistakes since Wed and wants to terminate her immediately. Thoughts?	
1	We are a company with base offices / corporate offices in GA but we have employees that work outside of GA. When those employees term, would a GA DOL Separation Notice still be applicable? or are their Separation notices per state? The one specifically in question today is TEXAS.	
0	We have an employee who we paid the final paycheck to and paid out accrued PTO and is asking if he gets accrual during final pay period. This employee is in Ohio.They accrue a certain number of hours per pay period 3.96 hours as long as working full-time.	
4	We discovered something on a stylists FB page. She posted a comment about customers coming into the shop late and how she hoped they got a STD. Two weeks prior she posted about coming in sick because she would be fired if she called out. We spoke with her after that comment and she was apologetic. We have decided she is not a fit and want to terminate. Looking for advice on best way to move forward. CC: Melissa Clancey - melissa.clancey@greatclips.net	
2	Attn: Suzanne Hi Suzanne - I am attaching a few write-up's that I have done over the past 3 days. I started capturing them for my sanity and to remember the details. Please find them attached. You can see I have another issue with another employee that may result in a similar scenario. Also, I am attaching a letter that I got from the Dept of Revenue, not sure if this provides any more clarity to our discussion or not. Please let me know if you have any questions as you are going through the write up. Thanks, Justin Welty 305-978-4343	
4	An employee was hired approximately 4 months ago and has expressed that she is not earning enough for the job duties. We have given her two payroll advances, which she is paying back through payroll deductions. She asked us to provide her with a performance review sooner than our standard 6-month review period, in hopes that she can get a pay increase. We want to be clear that a performance review is not a guarantee of pay increase. She also has been discussing wages and benefits with others, creating a disruption in the workplace. I would like to terminate her this Friday. Please advise and provide a sample termination letter.	
4	In the state of Texas is there a law that says that when an employee gives her 2 week and it's best that she leave at that time are we required to pay her for the 2 weeks.	
4	We hired someone who came in and did a few hours of work and then she walked out. She's requesting her paycheck but all I have is her job application and resume. Can I process her paycheck?	
5	An employee was recently furloughed and was instructed to call us for work on Friday. The employee did not call us on Friday, but he did call in on Monday, after his shift would have started. We considered that to be a voluntary resignation. However, we would not have had any work available for him on Monday. We do not have a written policy or practice that addresses this. The unemployment office contacted me via telephone asking if the employee had called us on Friday, would he have worked that Monday. I would like to speak with someone before responding to the unemployment office. The employee would not have worked on Monday as we had no work available for him, even if he had called us on Friday. Follow up: If we have EE that quit and they collect unemployment does that increase our unemployment. How does that effect company?	
2	Attn: Suzanne Thank you so much for sending. Can you let me know where I can get the pamphlet for unemployment claims or can I leave that part out?	
4	The employee said that she doesn't want to do her job anymore because too much pressure. There is no other position available for her. We are going to let her and I want to make sure we are on the right track.	
1	I just had a quick question on exit interviews and if we are required to have one if an exiting employee is requesting one. What are our options in that realm?	
6	I have an employee who will terminate tomorrow. I have to process two pay-periods. Would it be OK to pay his first pay-period tomorrow and then let the second period be paid by direct-deposit, later in the week?	
6	Can I deduct benefit premiums from an employees final check? If so, does this extend to all states?	
3	I have an employee that just barely made it through my orientation and training and they quit on me. I pay gas allowance - a small amount. Am I required to pay them? Even though they only worked a few days, I still have to pay them? Signing paperwork and orientation - is that paid time? I-9, W-4, employee handbook, is that paid time?	
2	Do you have a sample Severance Agreement template for those age 40 or older?	
1	We are terminating an employee in California and Im trying to finalize his termination packet. We terminated for nonperformance. And notified him last week that his last day would be the end of his contract which was yesterday. We have already received the EDD claim form from the state and wondered if that was something we fill out or if PrimePay fills it out.

1	I have two scenarios I would like to discuss. One is regarding an on-call employee that several times now has declined our calls to come in and the other have been on workers' comp for about 9 months. Neither of them has contacted us and we want to terminate. Do we contact them?	
2	I noticed in your meeting tips that you did not mention having the employee sign the notice of separation (see attached). We have always asked employees to sign this document to acknowledge that the conversation took place. Please advise on having them sign such a document.	
5	For salaried California employees, if I am giving a final check, if they are only working one day in the workweek, do they get paid the whole week? The person we are terminating is the safety director, who is associated with this accident. I gave the safety director information for the work comp claim related to the employee who was injured and is in the hospital. Our safety director, as far as I know, has not submitted the information to workers' compensation and we had a safety meeting this weekend he did not attend. He said he was on his way, but then couldn't make it to coaching his daughter's soccer game. This was the first large safety training. He did not show to meet with the adjuster. He is not responding to emails, etc.	
3	Termination pay. What earnings are included in separation pay. Employee works 12 hours per day seven days a week for three weeks then is off for a week. Employee is in Pennsylvania.	
5	We an employee that was arrested on Thursday night for theft of company property. On Friday we terminated the employee and wrote his last check. We have tried to reach out to the former employee since Friday with no response. We had been informed by this employee that he no longer had a residence and was living out of his car. What do i do with the last check? Is there someplace I need to mail it?	
4	An employee is part-time in our tasting room. There was some incidents on 10/28, that came to my attention last Wednesday night. I called the employee at home to determine she would be suspended pending an investigation. She was suspended for 3 days. I told her she needs to come meet with me - I am terminating her. She was come in Friday to pick up her check, she did not. She did not show up to meet with me today and see sent me an email and stated that after careful consideration she is giving 2 weeks notice due to hostile work environment due to autism and Misophonia. She goes on to say that she has been berated, etc. due to health condition. The manager stated she had no idea there was health conditions or a need for accommodation. We want to let her go - what do we need to do? Do we pay out sick? I'm preparing her check for today. I'll Fedex the check. She has a key I want it back. Should I keep her off the schedule? Do I tell her she is terminated? She wants a copy of the handbook. Can I accept the resignation today? If she declines to come in, what do I do? We had an employee who was suspended in August for 3 days. She gave a note to be out until December, but our handbook says we do not allow leave beyond 3 months. Do we terminate her now or when the doctor releases her? The supervisor does not want to bring her back. Do we investigate when this employee comes back?	
0	State of GA - must we pay out accrued vacation at time of separation?	
4	A client of ours would like to know if she closes down for two weeks because of lack of work does she have to pay the employees?	
1	We are a staffing Agency and have employees working at different locations. My question is, some employees have direct deposit and some of those employees stop showing up to their worksite location with out notice. Can we as the staffing agency deactivate his direct deposit so that a check is made instead and have employee come to office. Come to office to fill out employee resignation form etc.	
6	We provide uniforms to maintenance personnel at most of our locations. Most of these locations launder the clothing at the location while others take clothes home. My question is if an employee quits and does not turn in all clothing, can the cost of the unreturned clothing be deducted from his/her final paycheck? I suspect not, unless we have a signed document stating this would be the case. Help is appreciated!	
2	Terminating an employee in California remotely tomorrow and concerned about what forms the employee must sign.	
2	We are eliminating some positions at our company. Do you have a communications plan? Any helpful information?	
4	Exempt employee who's salary was recently reduced for cost savings measures on the company's part. We did allow her to reduce her hours as well. She has applied for unemployment benefits. Can she apply even if she is employed?	
4	Termination question. Kevin also on the line. Chris - CFO, 20 employees throughout country. Employee in Colo has been a constant attendance problem. She has been out 6 weeks already this year. Last week she said she is having an aneurysm, and she requested that I don't let anyone know. I told her we will need to let staff know that she will be out, but not the reason for her absence. I think she is aware her absences are excessive as we have provided her two different warnings that included further absences could lead to termination. Yesterday, she said, I might need surgery next year to correct this problem and mention FMLA and our handbook reference. We don't have to be compliant under FMLA because we dont have 50 employees. The handbook does make reference to FMLA but includes the definition of covered employer. Im comfortable with defending why she isnt eligible for FMLA, but Im concerned about her comment regarding her health concern. Does CO have any other leave law? Are we risking disability discrimination?	
6	Employee is believed to have taken funds from the company, and is now resigning. Can we deduct what we believe he has taken from the stores from his final pay?	
6	New York employee resigned with negative PTO, can we deduct from final wages?	
1	We are going to be eliminating a position. Previously we have given people the option of taking "severance" over a period of time, or getting a lump sum payout. If the employee chose the severance over time we would call it "notice pay" and would keep them on as employees, calling on them if needed. They would then maintain their benefits as well. Is this allowable?	
4	We have a terminated employee last week that she was making discriminatory comments and we have zero tolerance and she did not sign the term paperwork. She showed up right now. She wanted to talk about the situation we have someone that signed a paper stating that she said the discriminatory comment. Should I have her sign the term paperwork? Should I listen to what she has to say?	
4	Employee has been with the employer for a month; Executive Assistant to the company co-founder. For the last week the employee has not been working, texting, reporting off, or responding to contact from the employer, etc. She is a personal assistant and works outside of the office very frequently so it was not unusual for her to be out of the office however she has also not been in contact with the co-founder. We want to terminate her for job abandonment.	
4	Client: PA under 50 employees EE poor attendance and counselled her. Gave her part time work per her request and she is still calling out. They are going to terminate. We have reviewed any potential issues and just want to check in with you guys to make sure we thought of everything.	
4	One of our managers has resigned by sending me an two week notice email. She is scheduled to work for the next two weeks. I do not want her working in the salon anymore. Can I tell her that I accept her resignation immediately?	
2	Can you tell me the requirements are for final checks?	
4	We hired an employee 3 weeks ago, and she is a headache employee. She constantly complains and argues with her manager. Turns out she has pending lawsuits with two other employers. We are planning to let her go tomorrow, but we are worried. The reason for termination includes tardiness, insubordination, and falsification of doctor order. She is late most of the time. She is supposed to be at the location at a certain time and apparently coordinated with the client if it was OK to change her start time. She did not discuss this with her manager. She argues with manager. She changed the draw time on the record, but took the blood sample at a different time and the lab could not process.	
3	Regarding severance payments, is there a specific amount of money that an employer has to pay out to an employee? Such as two months worth of pay?	
4	CA employer - dealing with EE who does not want to work with the corporation any longer. How do we handle this? Do we terminate her? She hasnt formally resigned.	
2	Should exit interviews only be given by HR, or is it ok to have a supervisor or manager be present and/or give the exit interview?	
5	We have an employee who has been on a workers comp claim for over a year. We have tried to return him to work, but he was not able to. Most recently we have tried to initiate the work steps to return, however, he is not able to doe these steps. We are planning to terminate employment and are looking for a sample letter.	
5	What termination reason should we give an employee? We had been accommodating a 4-day schedule so that he could meet with his probation officer. Now he is requesting a 3-day schedule to meet with his PO twice per week. His position is full-time. Additionally, he does not have a license making it more difficult to give him work. What reason can we use for termination?	
5	An employee has been inappropriately using his paid sick leave for non-sick reasons. This is evidenced by text messages he sent to a substitute teacher weeks in advance to sub for him on the days he then called in sick. Additionally, he requested a week's vacation that we approved, then he submitted his letter of resignation, to be the date he would have been scheduled to return from vacation. We would like to change his resignation date to today. Can we discuss?	
1	We are at the tail end of an investigation. If we determine that we going to terminate the accused do we have to provide that employee with anything in writing regarding the investigation?	
5	Employee reported a work related injury in July, the physician released the individual on 8/8 with minimal restrictions. The employee worked for us approximately 2 days, the claim was denied, he has not reported back to work, and we are unable to reach him. He has an attorney. We would like to end the employment relationship with him due to job abandonment.	
5	Norah Eggland from Advantix Benefits Group called in with this question. Company hired a GM at end of July. He was given an offer letter, with a salary and at-will statement. Over the last few months he hasn't followed through on any projects, uses intimidating language, is not maintaining a positive work environment, and even broke a phone in anger. He didnt show up for work yesterday and the CEO called to let him know he was going to be let go. The GM has since stated he had the customer list and was going to wreak havoc on the business. Because he is an executive, are they obligated to offer a separation package? Are they required to provide a termination letter?	
5	We have an employee that has been with us for 3 years and has had attendance issues for the last 2 years. He has just returned to work after a worker's comp injury and shown poor attendance again unrelated to the injury. I would like to confirm there would be no repercussions to our company with him just coming off of a worker's comp claim if we were to terminate him due to attendance. Is there anything we need to be cautious of? Thank you	
4	Follow up for Christina - please call Denise at 209-452-4981. I don't want her back, I want her terminated, I do not care what kind of disability she has - she did not tell us she had issues. I can't allow her to come back - 10 other employees are saying they had a hostile encounter with her. She emailed me back this morning. She never came in Monday or Tuesday - I left her a voice message to coordinate final pay and getting the key and lasting for her last day. In the email, she states she has been dealing with medical issues since the first call. Her resignation is under duress, she requested the employee handbook. She signed she got a copy of the employee handbook. I have all the pay ready. She cornered an employee in a dish room area and the person couldn't get out and confronted her about saying something to the manager about her - she retaliated and she has flown off the handle at people before. She was suspended without pay. She needed to meet with first. (Now with Kevin-CFO) If an employee abandons the job we cannot send final pay? Denise: She did pick up her regular check on Friday I can drop that on the mail. She is not entitled to sick time - she cannot work until she comes to meet with me. unclear if there is a witness - no witness hard to prove - business decision to not pay sick, mail any checks, decline interactive process and not give handbook. EE is still employed.	
6	Utah - small layoff happening today. How many days for a separation agreement, for over 40 year olds;, is there something about 90 days? We gave them a spreadsheet of the ages of the people in the department. We are giving them 16 days of pay plus pay through today. When is their final pay due?

1	Our company is located in one Phoenix. We have one employee who moved to Washington State and was allowed to work remotely for the past 4 years. We would like to eliminate the position as remote and require that for this position be based in the office. We would like to give the employee as much notice as possible that the remote option will be eliminated and if she chooses not move back to Phoenix, we will offer a severance. Arizona is an at will state, are there any Washington state laws that I should consider?	
1	We have an employee who been here 90-days. Our introductory period is 90-days, and she's not working out. However, the manager does not have a good record of how the employee's performance is not up to their standard. I hesitate to go with a reason of "you are not a good fit" as the reason for termination. What might be some other reasons we could go with?	
4	I am having an issue with an employee and I spoke to my attorney part of my language and she can say that you fired her because she is old. He wanted me to have her sign an 9 page severance agreement because she is in a protected category.	
5	Mark (COO) on the phone Employee resigned yet we offered a severance package. He applied for UI benefits. We responded and he was denied benefits. He is now appealing that decision and we have a hearing. Can you offer some assistance on how we should respond to certain questions. We did not force him to resign but that is what he will allege. We called him into the office and stated he had been having performance issues and ask him if he wanted to resign. We told him we had a severance agreement if he want to resign.	
1	We don't have a lot of turnover here. Somebody came in and gave their verbal resignation to their supervisor and have verbally given December 1st as their last day. We cover benefits through the end of the month - we are going to be paying the whole month of December. Can we legally make his last day November 30th or does he have the choice?	
4	We have an employee we are about to terminate for violating company policy. She is pregnant and her common-law husband works here. She is supposed to make sales calls and instead she is calling a fax machine, listening for a while, then hanging up. We have several performance warnings on file for her already. Does her pregnancy prevent us from taking a negative employment action?	
1	We are doing a reduction in force and we need to meet with three employees who are being impacted. Should we meet with them separately or all together?	
1	We have an employee who is currently working with no restrictions that will be receiving a settlement from our WC Insurance for an injury sustained last year. The current job he is on is coming to an end and we will be laying him off. There are several different scenarios that exist, I just need a little help in understanding the exposure our company faces. We are based out of Morgantown, WV- the job site he is on is in DC.	
3	I have a follow up question about why the EDD would might provided UI benefits to someone who was not willing to work full time	
5	It's about an employee, he put in his notice but we want to let him go before.	
4	I have an employee who has been out of the office for the last three weeks. She was working with a COO who we just recently terminated. We believe the COO has allowed her to work from home, however, due to the termiantion of the COO, her position is no longer needed so we are planning to terminate her position today. Can we do this by email?	
3	Employer has an employee who has been a trainee, Title Searcher however the employer needs a more senior employee, a Title Officer. What is the most legal course of action?	
0	For Commission only sales reps, how will accrued vacation be paid at the end of employment?	
0	What is California State Law regarding terminations and commission pay? Example: Involuntary termination: Salary is paid up to day of separation. Commission everything that is booked/reconcilable will be paid. But what about commissions owed that haven't hit the books or per co. policy aren't deemed payable currently but may become payable later on? what is the timing of said commission payment? Next pay period? Next reconcilable period? Next policy period? Thanks	
4	I will be processing a termination. This employee has had attendance problems which were addressed. Today she left before her shift was over although we asked her not to leave early. I will be terminating her employment tomorrow morning. Are there any forms I need to provide?	
1	We are about to terminate an employee and we anticipate that this termination might become contentious. We want to know if we can record the termination.	
4	We have an employee on a workers' comp leave because we could not accommodate her restrictions. The case will be settled soon. She has requested we pay our her vacation. How would I process that and should it be part of her termination?	
1	We have a catering function and we hired a sous chef almost a month ago and we also have an executive chef. The sous chef position will be going away and we can hire a cook to do the same duties. This is a financial position. We are looking to separate from our sous chef next week and he just went out on a worker's compensation until Sunday and we will not be able to speak to him until Monday. Should we be concerned not that he has filed a worker's compensation claim?	
2	Do you have any information in regards to RIF's?	
1	We have an employee that we would like to layoff because we just don't need his position anymore. We just hired AM supervisor and they realized that we are way over staffed in the morning. The person we would like to layoff does prep work only. He is a 63 Hispanic male.	
5	We have an employee who we caught falsifying his timecard. We wrote him up and placed him on a 90-day probation. He has requested off the next day, and I don't think he should be able to take off after getting into trouble. Also if he does anything else wrong can be move forward with termination?	
1	We have a company policy which states that we do not pay out bonuses to employee who is no longer in our employ. We have an employee who is coincidentally being terminated on the day the quarterly bonuses are being released. What is our obligation to pay him that bonus? We additionally have a policy were we pay bonuses in lieu of severance to terminated managers if they sign their waivers.	
6	Rachel calling on Brenda's behalf. Employee who is on WC leave resigns. Should we notify the WC carrier? If EE has assets that they do not return, can we deduct from final wages? What if final wages do not cover cost of asset?	
2	Thank you. I just wanted to point out a few things. We have more than 50 employees, and the employee is still in the 90 day probationary period.	
3	looking for a form letter to send to an employee when they fail to show up for work and don't call iin for a few days.	
5	We are terminating an employee who asked to take employees from another team to help him with his project and when told no, he did so anyway. Could we define that as insubordination?	
4	We have a pt ee who is currently on workers comp. We feel that she is dragging out her claim and have wanted to terminate her even before she submitted the claim. Recently after hours she sent an extremely inappropriate picture via text to our director and two of her minor children. As a result one of the children refuses to be alone with her or ride in the car because he feels uncomfortable. How can we terminate them without her trying to say it was because of the claim?	
0	We are terminating an employee due to embezzlement. Our company policy states that employees who are terminated will forfeit their accrued vacation. Can you please provide the link to the VT statute that shows that employers must pay out accrued vacation time?	
1	We need to let someone go and we will be terminating them at the start of their day, how many hours do we need to pay them?	
5	We are terminating an employee today due to excessive tardiness. He was suspended in March due to tardiness, was on time in April, but today was late again. My suspension write up did not include language stating that future tardies could lead to termination. Is that risky? It is in our handbook. COBRA - our benefits end as of last day of employment. If he is terminated today and something happens to him tonight, is he still covered?	
4	We had a manager who was not a good fit for the position, so we offered to move her to sales and she declined. We asked her to think about it and she called yesterday and asked are you terminating me? We said no. She said she wasn't interested in the position. We are thinking about sending her a severance letter, contingent on letter of resignation. Severance would be one week pay per year of service.	
1	We have an employee who's currently in the middle of a workers comp claim but we need to abolish the position he's in as it's no longer needed. What are the ramifications of terming him while on workers comp	
6	In reference to a final paycheck, we have an individual who asked if she could send her boyfriend in to pick up the check. Can we release this to him?	
3	Will be have to pay unemployment when we fire an employee?	
3	An employer just received an employee's notice that their last day would be July 7th. Without 2 months notice, is there anything preventing the employer from releasing the employee prior to that last day (July 7), if they find a suitable replacement prior to then?	
5	We have an employee whom, for the 3rd time in three years has had "mental" episodes including violence and threats to our clients that resulted in him having to e removed from projects. Each time, we have communicated with him and given him a chance to "get help", which he did and we gave him his job back. This happened again this past weekend at a Company event and we want to know if we can terminate his employment. I have confidential backup information if you'd like me to send it to you for more background if needed.

4	We had an employee show up for admitting that she smoked marijuana that morning. When the supervisor approached, her she admitted that she has smoked that morning and she though she would be able to hide it well. We do have a drug-free workplace policy.	
5	A newer employee has been with us just over 3 months. He's having ongoing problems with performance. The manager is working with him on a daily and weekly basis. It has been communicated to him several times that he needs to take notes, he's not meeting the client's requirements, etc. It's apparent he will not be meeting our expectations. He's our first male employee, should that concern me? The most recent issue that is causing me to question termination is that he was observed going into his manager's office and taking a picture of the content of a closed file. In one of his counseling sessions he had asked if he could just take a picture of a client's contract to be sure he met their needs. Our response was that this would not be appropriate, a client's confidential is confidential, and that instead he needed to start taking notes. We feel that's a violation of trust and an ethical concern.	
3	I would like to find out: (1) If I-9 form must have in the employee personnel file? (2) Can we terminate an employee as he/she is not performing the task according to the job description? (3) Is it "Employment at Will" always in place from the first day the employees started working for the company?	
4	I have an employee who has offered to submit resignation and had to leave that day and now is wanting FMLA. Employee hired 12/1/16 as CFO Rental house Company car Laptop Phone Access to all our accounting programs Quickly we felt she was not working out. She was missing time at the end of the month and not being able to close out month end books. She was getting unnecessarily involved in other areas of the company. She could not focus on her job. At the end of April she stated that she might need to leave to assist her mother as she felt her father would pass away soon. We had a meeting with her on 5/2 because she was still having issues and not meeting her goals. She stating during the meeting several times in front of myself and my sister that she would resign. Immediately after the meeting she left to go care of her father. She's now requesting an FMLA leave and saying she might be able to work part time. We are not certain if we have to honor her request for a leave.	
5	A couple of weeks ago, we had a phone conversation with your representative, Beth, concerning an employee we knew was running a side company on company time using our company truck. This employee was terminated this week for insubordination and theft. The employee had heath care insurance for which we pay one-half and have already paid his entire premium for the month of May and his coverage will continue through 5/31/17. He has verbally threatened us if we hold the balance of May from his final check. We believe he is responsible for the entire balance, including the company portion, since he no longer works here. His final check will not cover the entire balance, and will leave him owing almost $200.00. Are we correct in that he would not only owe his half, but also the employer portion since he is no longer employed?	
6	I'd like to review the final pay laws for CA	
6	If an employee give notice on Friday, but they work on Saturday and Sunday when do we have to have a final paycheck?	
4	An employee is retiring and her last day of work will be June 23rd. A board member is suggesting we spread out the payment of her vacations accruals to reduce her taxes. Is this allowed.	
5	We are an online business, and have a programmer who works offsite. He is hard to get a hold of in general. The past week, he has been unresponsive to any contact attempt. He is supposed to be available 40 hours a week. He does have a lot of our passwords and credentials for our website. We have a new team taking over tech support for us, started on the 1st of May. We are thinking we do not need him anymore. What are the requirements for job abandonment termination? In January, he became more unresponsive, he said he had pneumonia but he never documented the medical issue. We havent heard from him since April 27th.

5	Hello! An employer sent me the following issue; can you confirm if based on their policy for non-compliance for Jury Duty and the absence whether they can let him go or if there is something else they need to be aware of with respect to their legal options surrounding Jury Duty: We have an employee that last week he mentioned to me that he might have to go to Jury Duty. I asked him if he knows for sure that he is going to Jury Duty, he must complete a Leave Request prior to his absence, and if he is serving he must call us on Monday to report his absence. He did not. He has not called us Monday, Tuesday nor Wednesday to report that he is in Jury Duty. An employee from here called him to report that we are looking for him and the employee called us. I talked to him and he told me that he was on Jury Duty. I remind him of our conversation last week and he apologize and told me "I know" . So he was aware of our policies about absences and calling in to report the absence. We have a policy that any employee that is absent for 2 days without calling or not showing up to work is automatically terminated. Can you tell me what is the best way to solve this issue. Thank you! Renee Melgoza President [cid:image001.jpg@01D118EA.479424C0] Melgoza Insurance Solutions 18388 Brookhurst Street Fountain Valley, CA 92708 P.714-968-1919, Ext. 202 F.714-968-1993 C.714-381-3192 License: 0G50651	
1	I have an employee that is planning to terminate. He was hired in May. He is not up to performance. We were hoping he'd get up to speed and is not contributing as much. Last month we had a performance review last month, he is missing work, being sick. It is sick day 10 and we may need to take it out of his personal days. Do we need to give notice, get a waiver or acknowledgement signed to protect ourselves? This most recent time has been stomach flu. Sick leave is not the primary reason for sure. We have offer letters, which states employment is at-will. Our handbook is also at-will. Handbook requires the employee to give 30 days notice. I can give him 30 days notice and pay if that is what is a concern. When is final pay due? I am happy with giving an extra months pay. Can I say weve decided to terminate and that the position is not matching and last pay will be in 30 days. Is that ok? What is the New York form? Can we give 30 days notice, its fine right? Its ok to terminate him, right? Does notice need to be in writing or verbal? Should we take the 30-day in writing policy for employees from our handbook? Do we have to terminate right on the spot if employment is at-will? Can we wait two weeks? Can you send the New York notice and sample termination letter, final wage rules, etc.?	
1	When an employee is being laid off, do we have 24-hours to provide their final paycheck? We are located in CO. If we determine that we are able to re-fill the postilion at some point in the future do we have to recall this person? Would their benefits run through the end of the month?	
1	As an "at will" employer, do we need to create a performance improvement plan before we let someone go? Second question- if we upgrade a position, due to changing and increasing requirements, do we consider that a layoff or a termination if the current candidate is no longer able to handle the job requirements.	
4	We hired an employee recently within the last 3 weeks, fresh out of school. We were going to train her - she went to 1.5 of the 3 days and left saying she had an emergency. Can we just let her go - she wasn't working out anyway? A franchisee had to pay a lot of unemployment - is this a concern? Can we just not offer any hours?	
3	Question: An employer fired an employee that was the system administrator of their system database and the employee is now refusing to give the employer the administrator password so they can have access to the system. Can the employer hold the final check of the employee in order to get the password? What options to they have to get the employee to cooperate with them?	
4	Gina also on the call. 2. Employee told us a month ago she was considering moving out of area. She said she would let us know when it is getting closer. She has now notified us that her last day will be 11/24, but we are closed for the holiday. Can an employee choose a term date that the business is not open as their last day? She obviously wants the two days of holiday pay.	
3	If an employee no longer has availability that meets the needs of the business, can we legally separate the employee if it does not state a minimum availability in the employee handbook	
1	AZ termination payments This has been gnawing at me so I researched it a bit this AM. We have a group of employees working for us in AZ and the AZ law states: Payment upon Discharge Employees who are terminated must be paid all wages due within seven working days from the date of discharge, or at the next regular payday - whichever comes first. * We pay one week in arrears and pay every Friday. * Our work week is Monday to Sunday. * We release payroll each Tuesday afternoon for Friday payment. * If we terminated someone on Wednesday, 11/8 as an example, they would be paid two checks: * 11/10 for 10/30 thru 11/3 * 11/17 for 11/4 thru 11/8 * We spell this out in their separation letter * In the above scenario, are we wrong in our payment? Would we need to issue a special check run on 11/8, the date of discharge, for the check that would normally be paid to them on 11/17? * Many times I am told the day of, or the day before, that we are terminating someone in this group. If you require further information, please let me know. Thanks very much for your help!

4	I have a PT admin asst that has had issues with attendance and punctuality. She provided us with a letter from a DR stating she can no longer work on weekends. This does not fit our business need. I need direction on how to proceed. The employee is habitually and constantly complaining. She did not do her duties this weekend. She cannot work full-time due to a disability. She should be restricted to working only 3 days a week, and cannot be on call or work on weekends. She works on the weekends as a back-up for our person on call and checks time - she has been alternating weekends for quite some time. The schedule no longer fits our business needs. The issue during the week is her being late and lack of productivity. Her cat was sick, electrical fire, exterminator coming, etc. She's been on 3 days a week, but doesn't want to work the rotating call. Unless she can change something with her availability and improve her work - her biggest value was the on-call. What if we don't go there and tell her we need someone full-time? We were considering it anyway. We considering just laying her off? What about performance-based termination? She is late everyday. We have disciplined her in the past.	
4	Employee speaks English only and many of our clients are Spanish speaking. She is our receptionist and often has to hand the phone over to someone who speaks Spanish. In addition, she is frequently late and she works OT when I tell her she cannot work OT. May I terminate her?	
1	Texas: We have an employee who provided two weeks notice but release him from duty early. Do we have to pay him for two week notice? What about commissions?	
0	An employee resigned on the spot. She is in Pennsylvania. PTO and Comp time. Do we have to pay it out?	
1	We have an employee who has been with us for a while and over the last two years we have had discipline issues, mistakes on work, and attendance issues (most of which are documented). We thought this person was doing well and had a positive review a few months ago but then we got into our busy season and are facing the same issues. Our question is. We are debating to let this person go Dec 1 and cut our losses or Jan 1. If we let go Jan 1 they will receive a team bonus payout and we are not really sure what is the best thing to do. We have tried different positions and working with this person and it just isni12t working. We also doni12t want to reward mistakes. Please advise. Thank you.	
1	Termination - do we have to give severance pay? We want to know if the employee doesn't show up, can we terminate. The offer letter states employment-at-will and that either the employee or the employer can choose to terminate providing a 30-day notice. He is under performing, are we allowed to offer a lower position? If he doesn't return the key, can we deduct the cost of the key?	
3	We have an employee who provided two weeks notice. The employee then advised they will not be able to finish out the two weeks notice, and states that day will be their last. How long would the employer have to provide her final check? When an employee is on a medical leave of absence, are they obligated to pay for the full cost of the benefits, or just their portion?	
4	We're having an issues with a stylist I think we're going to have to terminate. The stylist has been with us fr about 7 months. Her performance has been ok, skills are good, but we have had issues with the way she interacts with staff and customers and customers have complained she is unfriendly. Recently a lady came in with her 15-year-old son. There was a disagreement, the customer wanted his hair blended a certain type of way and the stylist got frustrated and the customer was upset. She said "well have a nice day" and when he did not respond she said "well fuck you then." She's not disputing what happened and two stylists witnessed it. Is that grounds for termination? We have worked on performance with her in the past. We have talked to her several times and have been trying to work with her. She is a white female with no disabilities. She has had an intermittent bad back or a migraine but we've always accommodated. We became aware of the incident over the weekend and has investigated and our manager talked to the manager. What are the required termination forms?	
4	We had an employee resign; her resignation date was as of Monday. We called the sales planning department to see if she was in any of their programs in order to determine if there was money owed to her through one of these programs. We were initially advised she was not in any programs, however, the outgoing employee asked about her car allowance. I now need to know the rules for this program, how it works, and what is due to the employee. I have drafted communication to the sales planning department and just wanted another set of ears to help assess if I have thought of everything.	
3	What date to document as a term date? If they were fired should it be the last day worked or the date that they were going to resign.	
4	I received a call from a former employee asking me to confirm her termination date. I called her back confirming the date she resigned. Now she's requesting a copy of her resignation letter. How should I respond since I accepted her resignation verbally?	
3	Hi, We're giving an Employment Termination Agreement and Release of Claims (severance agreement) to an employee. Two questions: 1. Can I email this to the employee or do I need to mail it? 2. There is a place for the employee to sign and the company to sign. Does the company need to sign it now before giving it to the employee or does the company sign after the revocation period of 7 days is done? (Revocation period for employees older than 7 days. We have employees all over US including NY where the employee is from, MA, VA, etc. Thanks, Angelica	
3	I have a nonprofit in CA. is it illegal to not pay out an employees sick leave when they leave a company?	
2	Follow up: We offered severance to an employee. They signed off on the separation agreement today. I know we are supposed to wait 28 days or just 7 days?	
1	We have a received information that one of our employees may have a warrant out for his arrest. Are we allowed to ask him about it? If it is true, can we fire him over it if it is something that would not pass our background check?	
1	We have actually received below email / resignation from him. Things is happening faster than we thought. Some questions: 1: Now with below email, we are confirming this is voluntary resignation and we dont need to give him 30 days pay, correct? 2: Do we still need to get written resignation from him? Or below email is enough? 3: What would be the next step? Anything else I need to cover for? I can confirm his benefit ending date with just works and let him know? I apologize for my recent absence, but I wanted to follow up with you both regarding my status. After heavy consideration I have made the decision to resign from Adolescent today, Thursday Nov 9, 2017. I wanted to thank you both for the opportunity to work with the team and allow me to experience a motion design studio first-hand. I have learned a lot in my time here and appreciate all of the chances I was given to broaden my experiences. Unfortunately at this time I feel my current role was not in line with my personal career goals so I have decided to seek opportunities elsewhere. Thank you again for your time and giving me the chance to be a part of the team. Any additional documents required can be mailed to my home address and I will reply as quickly as possible. I will be returning the signed Employee Handbook as requested in the following days. -Colin Leiker	
4	We have an employee who we are probably going to terminate and we want to make sure that we going to do things correctly. She's a part time employees who has been with us for several years. We have had issues with her over the years regarding her performance. Recently she sent an email complaining about her supervisor. Should we investigate that complaint, she claims that the manager is not creating a team atmosphere. Are we okay to terminate the employee? We do not have collective bargaining agreement.	
4	Exempt employee in CA gave resignation. She has been working 6 days a week. Do we owe her for working the 6th day? Retail employee in Boston, MA was injured on the job. Work restriction is to work a non standing job 4-6 hours per week. We are accommodating by giving her admin duties one day a week. How long do we keep this accommodation?	
6	I am looking to clarify whether an exempt employee can have their final pay reduced for negative PTO balances.	
4	Employee accommodated under the ADA (claimed WC denied; is disputing) however she is having performance issues. Company has accommodated per medical certification and kept up with interactive process however she has performance issues and has been counseled and corrected in accordance with company policy. The employer is ready to terminate the employee and wants to discuss.	
5	We have an employee where we have very little documentation but the behavior is very offensive and vulgar and he has been known to throw nasty stuff about us on Facebook. They want to terminate him with a severance agreement and have a confidentiality agreement - non-disparagement. Termination is for text message to people in leadership positions and coworkers and on the radio system. He uses it to let off steam. He has a negative tone in general in public environments and makes his opinion well known. The person who heads the department wants to let him go. Our worry is he will slam us on FB, text everybody he knows, and make more harassing or offensive comments. He is harassing someone online that is an employee not a manager. The employee is vulgar and offensive and using foul language on the radio, which violates our policy. He is not happy about who gets help, who gets out when, decisions being made at the offensive. He is being disrespectful in general. For example we put timecards in a bin when we want to talk to them. His timecard was in my bin, he came in "who the f- pulled my timecard, I don't need to deal with this shit, etc." He left without talking to me. I usually copy and paste what parts of the handbook we're referring to. I put the radios and the conduct in or offensive, bullying conduct, insubordination, disregard for authority, disrespectful, obscene language. I didn't think about adding the workplace violence - intimidation, threatening gestures, physically damaging acts. The employee is over age 40 - agreement would not likely include age discrimination. Sample agreement?	
2	What is the best practice for administering Exit Interviews? Can you send it to their home address or email?	
4	Employee in AZ. Current office is closing and being moved so she will be laid off. Want her to work through 12/1 with severance through 12/31. How best to phrase the agreement?	
2	What termination paperwork to we provide an employee upon termination, in California?	
6	We have an employee who left on Friday. He is on our health insurance which will cover him through the end of the month. We deduct premiums on a weekly payroll. We have employees sign an authorization for these deductions. Can we deduct the final three weeks premiums from the final pay?	
2	I'm trying to find a sample company closure letter. There's no COBRA, no state continuation everything is shutting.	
4	Job abandonment. Sent a term letter. She filed an UI appeal and we went to appeals court. We lost and were decided as the moving party. Best practice for the future?	
5	He has been given many wry debts for his performance issues. Can I hold the employee accountable for poor performance while on workers' compensation? Insert e have an employee who has an open workers' compensation case. The employee has been return to full duties as of August 2017. We've had performance issues with this individual for many years.Can we hold the employee accountable for his poor performance under workers' compensation? He is on a final written warning and still having performance issues	
3	Two employees were expected to remain employed until the end of the year however the customer cut back the work they planned on giving us and now these two employees will be laid off. Employer usually provides one week of severance the manager has asked if any part of these employee's pay can be included as severance pay in exchange for a severance agreement?

1	Regarding employee termination -CONFIDENTIAL does not want logged. Sister of employee called to inform us that our employee is in the hospital and expected to be out of work all week. That employee was on a short list of a reorg due to business conditions. Should we be concerned about her medical leave and whether we can include her in the reduction? We will be notifying other employees this week.	
2	Can you send me information on any forms which must be provided at time of termination?	
1	We offered a severance package w 6 mos of pay and 6 mos of health insurance (COBRA). He does have other deductions, (alimony, supplemental insurance) we are wondering if we have to pay that? I don't know if those are things we need to continue paying. He signed a severance letter agreeing to this. We are self funded for the insurance part of it, so it is a little quirky.

5	Employee resigned on 1/30 - on 2/1 he decided that he didn't want to work the 2 weeks he initially said he would. We are okay with that. My question is - do we need to pay him for the 30-50 minutes he was in the office on 2/1? He was paid through 1/31 already.	
4	An employee who has been with us 4 months mentioned she was having some personal problems. She requested and we approved 5 days of PTO. She was expected back on Monday. She's been a no call/no show to us for 5 days however, we found out from our client where she work that someone called in on her behalf stating she wasn't feeling well. We still haven't heard from her. We're thinking about termination and would like to discuss with you.	
5	We have an employee who resigned as of 2/2 but his actual last day of work was 1/29. On 1/29 we told him we were moving him to another position. He then took a personal day on the 30th, no call no showed the 31st, and then emailed a resignation letter on the 1st saying the 2nd would be his last day. Benefits would be effective for the month of February if he was employed on the 2nd. What is his termination date?	
2	Are the 72 hours business or calendar days?	
6	Employee resigned via email last night at 9:30pm. We understand we have 72 hours to provide the final wages. When does that clock start? When he sent the email or the first hour we opened for business today? He is scheduled to receive a direct deposit on Monday which will include all the hours we owe him. Can we let that payment go through this way? We have a new payroll provider and are unsure we can stop the direct deposit.	
1	.We are terminating for poor performance and they have been here for 4 years and they are over the age of 40. We have documented the performance issues. If I fire him today when do I owe his final check? What about vacation? I would like to pay the employee's for COBRA and provide severance.	
5	Per Client: An employee verbally put in his two weeks on Monday, January 30 but provided a letter that stated he voluntarily ended his employment on Friday, Feb 3. Can you confirm that we can use Feb 3 as his last day to receive salary (ie, not pay him the full two weeks)?	
3	Do employers have any obligation to communication anything about unemployment benefits to an employee they are terminating?	
4	An employee who reports to me has had performance issues. Its not so much about the work she performs, its how she performs it. I have had to talk with her several times about her attitude, insubordination, swearing, and general disrespectful workplace behaviors, etc. We are going to terminate her today and give her a check for two weeks to help her with her transition. We want to talk about the termination paperwork, termination meeting, and if you have information about misconduct/discipline/insubordination. (Issue 1 of 3)	
5	I have an employee who was expected to start and then came in saying that he couldn't work because something came up. On his next scheduled day, he came in. I worked with him for 3 hours and his work was not up to our standards. He didn't clean well and he was on the phone taking personal phone calls when he was suppose to be working. I had to tell him to get off the phone so that he could help me. What is our liability if we terminate him?

1	Employee was hired in April 2015. We may be letting him go and offering severance. What is the general guideline for severance amount based on his years of service?

4	We had an employee who was on a leave for cancer treatment She was to return and has now given notice. She was not eligible for FMLA, but was on a personal leave. Our policy states that employee accrue PTO while on an FMLA leave. Do we need to pay out the PTO to her now that she is terminating. Please also send information on the ADA, as we have never heard of that before.	
4	We made an offer on Friday and she accepted. She was going through orientation and the supervisor said that the behaviors and comments we don't think we want to continue to employ her.	
2	Please send information about terminating an employee, any tips or scrips would be appreciated. (Issue 2 of 3)	
5	We have an employee who traveled for work but did not follow our instructions about returning. He choose to remain in the area. We have decided we're going to terminate for insubordination. He no longer has access to the truck he drove there. Do we need to pay for his return?

3	For a terminating employee in Texas who has medical insurance, is there a maximum that an employer can pull from their final check to cover their employee portion of their medical premium?

4	We have an warehouse staff that was given a final warning and placed on probation for 30 days. If there was any unexcused absence, we will terminate immediately. She signed the warning on 01/24/17, but she just texted this morning 02/06/17 at 4:13am to the manager she was not coming in due to illness. Can we consider this an unexcused absence and terminate?

1	Molly 718-576-2608 molly@mouth.com We are laying off a group of employees and one of the employees are considering laying off currently on a paid maternity leave. Should we continue to pay her for the leave time? Should she get the same severance? Please send severance information?	
1	We would like to talk about severance/separation agreements and the process we can follow as we prepare to terminate a female employee who is over age 50, and has been with the company about 4 years. We do not have written documentation, but she has been talked to in the past.	
5	I followed up with the manager and there were biweekly check-ins regarding the performance, the employee acknowledged he needed to make some improvements and there was no other mention of accommodation needed or other issues that have made it difficult for his performance to improve.	
4	An employee's last day worked was Feb 1. She only worked a portion of the day, less than one hour. Must we retain our benefits through the end of the month? She already received her wages for that portion of the day, but may have a bonus due. Can we deduct the benefit premiium from her bonus?	
4	I have some questions I'm hoping you can help me with... Last Thursday an employee called me and told me that she wanted to come talk to me. She told me she was tired of the "hearsay" and the text message she received from her supervisor. She mentioned that her supervisor made her feel like she was not needed. I told her that I had heard that she turned in her door badge and her keys. I asked her if she spoke with her supervisor and she told me no. She mentioned that a co-worker had told her that her supervisor said that she needed to call her and apologize and she was giving her 24 hours. I asked her if she quit and she said she was too upset to make a sound decision. I asked her if what she wanted was to come talk to me to talk about her supervisor and she said yes. I informed her that I needed to get some HR advice and I would call her back. I thought about the situation some more and called her back to make sure I had some of the facts correct. I asked her if she worked any that day and she said no. I asked her again if she talked to her supervisor and again she told me no. She was recently a full time employee, however, she resigned that position and took a PRN position to help PGL out. I believe she works like 1am-3am or 2am-4am and then goes to her other job. Her supervisor is not here during her shift. When I asked her who she turned her keys into, she said she put them in an envelope and put them in the pocket of her supervisor's door. I told her that according to our policy, she should have talked to her supervisor and because she didn't, that day was considered a "no-show". Her next day to work was to be Monday and I told her that would be her 2nd "no-show" day and thus she would be terminated for job abandonment. I told her that if she really planned on quitting and did not want to talk to her supervisor that she needed to submit a letter of resignation. I told her she could put her supervisor's name on the envelope and drop it off at the front desk. I again told her I would get back to her once I had some HR guidance on the matter since it appears she wishes to file a complaint about her supervisor. She did submit a letter of resignation but put it in an envelope addressed to me. It reads "I ________ resign from PGL on the day of Feb. 2, 2017." It was signed by the employee. Questions: 1) Should I still talk to her even though she quit? We don't typically do exit interviews here, so I'm unsure whether I should or shouldn't talk to her. 2) If I should, I'm assuming that I will just document whatever it is that she wants to say about her supervisor. 3) Then what? Should I just wait and see what she says, then follow up with another email to y'all? 4) Also, am I required to let her know what action we took? I wouldn't think so, but there should be some way for me to let her know that the situation has been handled, or not? Thank you so much for your advice! I hope to call her back tomorrow and let her know something so I'm hoping to get your response soon!!

6	Do I process payroll as normal at the end of the month or should I pay a leaver on Friday this week his final pay on the day he leaves?	
5	We have an employee who requested medical leave for surgery which was approved. Per our employee handbook, a doctor's release is needed to return to work. The doctor released the employee on the 19th but the employee did not produce the medical release until the 11th of the following month (During the medical leave the employee filed for unemployment which was denied.) The employee then returned to work two weeks after the medical release was produced. Should I have reported him as a new hire? Also the same employee was later laid-off and called back to work yesterday. He showed up to the office late, picked up his time slip, was given instructions to go to a job site and then disappeared. No one has heard from him. What do we do?	
4	I have an employee that was out on FMLA and since she has returned, her payroll deductions for her insurance have been increased due to the retro premiums she owes back to the company. She was involuntarily terminated yesterday and now I'm wondering how much we can deduct from her final pay check since she still owes a lot of money. We are in TX and we have her authorization to deduct premiums owed to the company.

1	Can we let go of an employee that is not dependable and reliable due to she is out sick a lot, when we talk to her we would not mention the word sick at all. Are we able to do that or not, or what can be done	
4	We have an ongoing employee situation. We have an employee (sales) who is a female who has been with us since last December. She has not been productive in sales and has had multiple coachings. She has not made one sale. We tried to give her professional development. Her supervisor (our President) had a meeting with her in June, in which she said she is not comfortable with people. We brought in a male salesperson with 20 years experience and a proven relationship record. We thought we would pair her technical and his sales skills. She's been very defensive and she feels the company is not being fair to her because she is a female. I spoke with her directly. She was going into sales meetings disheveled - I told her she needs to pull it all together, she said she said she did not know what to wear. I told her to find clothes and a hair style she was comfortable in. She stated she felt I was telling her to change her appearance. I told her we were just asking her to be more professional. She stated there was a lot of sexism in the oil and gas industry. We've been trying to do some additional coaching and she has started making comments about the company being sexists. She made a formal complaint today that her sales partner stated that the business is male dominated business and he suggested she focus on female decision makers and he would focus on the male decision makers. I don't know this is harassment. We were ready to terminate and she has made this complaint. She states initially that our President was present during the conversation. He states he told them to air their differences, but he was in the backseat on the phone. I asked her again and she said well, he was on the phone, maybe he didn't hear any of that. He said she was telling him he was manhandling her (not physically) and he was telling her where opening in the sales meeting was. I have not talked to male employee yet. I want to have a game plan. There's no where else to put her. We just talked Friday afternoon and made the decision to move forward with termination. Does it help to delay the termination a few weeks? talk to him, see what he says go back to her, see if this was the only specific incident what is her requested resolution? seek counsel to minimize risk and close the investigation	
5	One of our pastors announced in social media that he is leaving our church. Many members of our congregation are now talking about this. But the pastor has said nothing to me here in HR. I sent him an email asking what his plans are and he has not responded. How should I manage? A backstory: the pastor has MS and we hired another pastor to work with him. The original pastor may not be happy and may be looking for us to pay him out. Not sure whether he is truly voluntarily resigning or whether he feels he is being pushed out.

4	I have a group located in Illinois. They recently termed an employee; however, as part of the employee's severance package, they are going to continue to pay her 100% of her salary and benefits through the December of 2018. The question is, can the group wait to terminate her until the end of 2018, and then send out her State Continuation letter, or do they have to "terminate" her with the insurance carrier and in turn pay for her COBRA for the next 12 months.	
5	A manager terminated an employee on Friday. The employee is requesting a letter stating he was terminated. Do I need to provide him something in writing?	
3	A former employee requested copies of his personnel file, does it need to be sent certified mail with return receipt to show we have complied with the 10 day turn around time? or can it be sent first class?	
5	A person wants to a leave for personal reasons (care for wife) and his wife was just laid off, and a tree fell on their house. He has no idea when he'll be back. The tree is the final straw. We offer leave for 30 days for personal leave. I am thinking of terming him today. We were going to term him anyway. We have 5 people on our staff who are JD law clerks, we were going to termed after Friday results. He were to take a family leave, when he returns, how long do I have to wait to terminate him after he returns? The two people we want to term are already attorneys.	
2	Do you have a sample form to help employers determine which employees they will eliminate?	
3	I called on Friday and I had asked a question about final pay in Washington D.C. One option was written in this fashion: According to D.C. Code Ann. 32-1303, whenever an employer discharges an employee it must pay the employees wages earned no later than the next working day. However, if the employee was responsible for monies belonging to the employer, then the employer is permitted 4 days from the date of discharge or resignation for the determination of the accuracy of the employees accounts, at the end of which time all wages earned by the employee must be paid. Is that 4 business days or calendar days?	
3	Employee gave two week notice today; can employer immediately discharge?	
6	An employee had passed away yesterday morning. The employee is non-exempt and we owe the employee final wages. Can we just process the final wages on the normal pay cycle and issue direct deposit to the employee's bank account that was already in effect?	
4	I was talking to an Advisor last week about an employee I want to let go. We came up with instead of all the different reasons, that we have changed the job description and that I can give her the chance to become fluent in Spanish. She is still out sick. I would just love to tell her. I've got someone to take her place already. Maybe I should everything in the bud tomorrow. She was out of protected paid sick leave. She has been out all last week and today due to the flu. It would be easier to terminate her tomorrow, today is payroll. I was going to tell her we'd changed the job description and that we need a Spanish speaking gal - do I have to give her the opportunity to LEARN Spanish?	
1	We have a 25-person company in IL with a full-time engineer who is 64 years old. We need to terminate his employment for lack of performance and would like to know what the ramifications are as he is in a protected class. Would we need to set up a conference call to discuss?

5	We decided to terminate an manager and I have a director speak to the manager to meet at the office at 5pm today. He keeps wanting me to call him. Can I terminate him over the phone?	
6	Employee was given sign on bonus, which included an agreement they would stay for at least 90 days or they would need to pay back the bonus out of their final check.

3	A client's employee resigned. They would like to know if they are required to pay their usual contribution?	
1	Thank you for this! Eventually this will effect appx 60 employees, however we are not sure of timing (most likely will be different stores at different times) and its not the same location. As its 60 people, will this mean I need to follow the WARN act?	
1	I need a no call/no show policy. We need to provide something to the employee regarding alerting employee that she did not show up to work as schedule. We would like something that is very gentle in it's wording, but we want to the employee to eventually resign.	
1	Our company is a partnership and one of partners has decided to sell the partnership, so we will have to dissolving the organization. We still have our original book of business and that company. We will be offering employment to most of our employees, but we do not want to offer employment to the employee who is on a leave of absence. We only have 4 employee's total including the employee on the leave. How should we go about telling the employee that he's going to be terminated?	
3	If I need to cut my payroll costs by either eliminating positions or those under performing, how is that done legally? I am referring to two positions.	
5	We terminated an employee today understand a mutual agreement. We have been going back and forth for some time attempting to make an accommodation. We offered him a few weeks of severance to him and he countered with 3 months. The employee had a borderline personality disorder, and needed accommodations with communications attendance issues overly sensitive We'd had another issue with him last week, we sent him home with pay on Tuesday and let him know that we'd let him know how we'd be preceding with his employment but that things are not really working out. That things were not really working out right now for either party. He then called out on Thur and Friday. Are we at risk for not outright terminating him?	
5	We have an employee who is out on Worker's comp leave. He has not responded to any emails because he has an attorney. Can we terminate him for not responding to our letters or phone calls?

4	Employee decided Sunday, Nov 5, not to take the deposit to the bank. The following Monday she didn't show up for work. I went to the bank to get the deposit and saw she had not made the deposit. Several attempts to contact her have been unsuccessful. No contact as of yet. We are going to terminate and want to take the $125 out of final check. She has been on Facebook posting, so we know she is not in danger. Are we allowed to take the money out of her final wages?	
3	How does unemployment work in Illinois? What would disqualify someone from getting unemployment?	
1	We have retail stores that we will be closing down in the next couple of month and we have gotten direction form the board that we need to shut down one store immediately. We have 7 employees there in total and I am wondering how to facilitate this?	
4	We have an employee we terminated and gave a 6 months severance to (we are also paying for her COBRA) and she has commission coming to her. Do we tax the severance and COBRA? We're giving her money up front.	
3	Question 2 of 2 Company has an employee they laid off. They pay 60% of employee premiums. They were wondering if they can pay 60% for 14 days employee worked and then can they pro rate that and make employee pay the full amount the days they didn't work?

2	how to conduct a termination	
3	We have a client who is on bi-weekly payroll period (26 pay periods). If they are terminating someone today, would they be able to double the premium deduction for the outgoing employee?	
4	We have 6 retail thrift stores we use to support our hospice non-profit. We are closing one of our stores and everyone has known for a year. An employee is pregnant and will be going out on PDL before the store closes. I feel comfortable not terminating her - we presented transition packets to all employees, who are given first chance to interview for openings. She cannot interview - she is going out in the next week or two. (7 people affected). On the date the store closes, what is our obligation to this employee? Do we tell her she still has a job? The others who do not secure transfers will be terminated. The person on PDL still wants to work for us.	
5	We have an new employee who has had performance issues and were going to put him on a performance improvement plan but in the discussion with his manager, it was decided that the job should change. We all work remotely and he lives in FL. Because of the nature of the work, we have decided that for this position, we are going to want to have someone on site in SF. Therefore, rather than PIP the employee (and he has performance issues not related to his location), we are going to terminate, based on the decision made to how we're going to service this account locally. He's been with us for only a few months, so it's unfortunate that we hired him and then determined it needed to be a local position... we will offer him severance in terms of signing an agreement with us. Is there anything else we need to do? FL and CA are "at will". He is over 50. Thanks,	
1	We have a new employee that started a month ago and just isn't getting up to speed fast enough and taking too long to train. How should we approach letting her go?

4	One of our employees walked off their shift last Tuesday the 7th, I've been trying to reach her via phone without success. Since it's been a week and we have not heard from this employee, is it safe to "assume" that she has abandoned her position and I can now send a letter stating that she is no longer an employee with us?

4	I have a former employee applying for unemployment benefits. I'm looking for help on how to answer some questions on the form. This employee was well-known but didn't like taking repeat customers. When customers would show up they would request her. She would refuse them and other stylists were put in the awkward position of telling them gently that she wasn't taking any requests. We offered to move her to another location where there would be a lower demand for her. Eventually she quit.	
3	We have an employee that resigned on Friday. They told us today that their last day was Friday. They clocked in on Friday but they did not clock out. They said they worked 4 hours. We inquired what they were doing those 4 hours because they were not in office. Do we need to include the 4 hours they said they worked. It's an outside rep.

5	Non-exempt employee received disciplinary warning in August for falsifying time cards in August; today the employee misreported his lunch time. He clocked out for lunch at 1P and twenty minutes later clocked back in. His supervisor saw him taking lunch at 2P and asked him why he was taking lunch at that time. The employee told the supervisor that his co-workers asked him to do some work at 1:20P so he returned to work then later took the lunch time he missed but did not properly clock out. Employee has other performance issues where he is falling short on initiative and completing tasks; in fact, the employer was going to speak to him and now the employer wants to terminate. Considerations for discussion?	
1	Follow-up: One of the individuals without a background screen is now involved in a sexual harassment claim. If we terminate based on the background results, can it be used as retaliation against us for the sexual harassment complaint? If we terminate for sexual harassment, should we add the background information? We offer custodial services, the recruiter did not follow up on the background.	
4	We have an employee for customer support that we hired on 11/1/17, she is not catching on and not comprehending at a rate that we need. The manager sat her down on Monday and asked how she was doing and told her that she was not catching on. The employee asked what that meant and the manager stated she needed to talk to me. We do a skills profile and we did not give that to her as an oversight. We gave it to her on Monday and she scored below the range that we would generally hire someone. We think that we will waste time if we continue employment.	
1	We are looking at possibly downsizing our management staff, and are wanting to know some legalities around doing such.	
3	One of my roles is to serve on boards of clients (many are non-profit) and a company has a contract with a member (not sure its W-2 or 1099) for a year. The person is not meeting expectations and they want to put them on a PIP and set it up so they're in a position to terminate. Do PIPs exist for 1099s. Do they extend the contract for a month? What do they need to do if its a W-2 employee? Assuming this is an employee, if they just decide its not working out, can they just say this isn't working out and cut a last check? Vacation is due at termination?	
3	How long do I have to pay an employee after firing them?	
4	Employee is a study coordinator, a managerial salaried position, and has been with us for 4 months. She is scheduled to work, 8:30 to 5:30 each day. It is a violation of company policy to not call in before start time as it has a detrimental effect on the studies and our business. First incident, 4 weeks ago, she didn't show up at her normal time which was out of character. Supervisor texts her, and she finally responded saying she took her sister to hospital, and is on her way and will be there shortly. We had called her Mom, to do a wellness check. Employee never came in or responded after that text. She showed up the next day. Said she had dropped sister off at the ER, and on way to work got pulled over for speeding. The officer noticed she had unpaid ticket and told her she had to go right then and there to pay the ticket. Drove there, and it took a long time to pay the ticket. We had been sending texts all along. She said she was too embarrassed to return the calls. We gave her a warning, and reminded her of the requirement to be accessible at all times, told her it we would not be willing to overlook the next time. She came back and everything was fine. Last Monday, she didn't show up for work. Never called in an hour before like policy requests. Eventually she lets us know she planned to come in on Tuesday, but didn't show up. Severe abdominal pain, going to doctor. We told her it was the 2nd day in a row you haven't called in. She goes to the doctor and text back later, doctor said she has a cervical bruise. Was told she would probably have pain for another week, but will be OK to work Wednesday. We didn't ask for doctor note because it had only been 2 days. Wednesday unresponsive through 11am. At 1pm finally texted she was on her way to ER, due to abdominal pain. We said OK, but make sure you get a doctor note. Told us she probably won't be in tomorrow, but I will have a note. She tells us the diagnosis is pelvic infection. Not serious enough to be hospitalized. We asked her to please be available on Thursday for questions if needed. Didn't come in Friday. By end of day Friday, we needed urgent info from her, no response. Saturday, no response, please respond. Sunday no response. We tell her on Sunday it has been 72 hours without responding. Against company policy. No doctor note, we are wondering about job abandonment and need her to respond. Within 30 seconds, she responded. States she has a kidney infection and stones. but was not admitted to hospital. She is at home, and will call in an hour. Two hours later she called the owner saying I'm fine, will be at work tomorrow. Was told she needs a doctor note to excuse the whole week. Monday comes, no show, no call. No response to messages. At 2 pm she text Angie and says, blood in urine, can't afford ER. Monday after work, Stacy tells her we wonder if she is intending to come back to work. Someone texted back saying she was in the ER. Tuesday, no call no show no response. What if she shows up tomorrow with a doctors note?	
1	I need to know the legal aspect behind a lay off. For example, if we need to lay off because work load isnt there to justify the position, once the work picks back up and we need to hire again, do I have to hire the person that was laid off or can I re-open the position to the public? Is there a time-frame that advises when you ask the previous employee versus opening to public?	
6	An employee of ours stole one of our trucks and drove it out of town. We have proof that he did this from the GPS on the vehicle and surveillance cameras. We feel this was willful misconduct. Can we deduct the cost of the fuel from his final paycheck? This is an Iowa employee.	
6	Employee was caught stealing money and getting ready to terminate. Can we hold the final check until we receive the money back?	
4	Lori Kane calling on behalf. An employee has received a severance agreement and has asked if she can have her severance payments provided over a period of time. We are fine with that, how should we indicate that in her severance agreement?	
4	We let go of an employee yesterday and she wanted to know the reason for the termination. The manager had only said he was making changes to the department. She did not ask any questions at that time. She didn't trust the manager so we let her go..	
3	Have an employee hired temporarily in September through January through a temp agency but now an employee. Eligible for UI?	
3	If you have an employee who is out on work comp while the company is going through layoffs due to a financial restructuring, and the employee's position has been identified as one to be cut, can you terminate the employee while on work comp?	
3	Margeaux Appold - Manager New employee with only three months of employment and looking to terminate. Just not a good fit.	
1	Part time employee who works 8 hours a week and her performance is very poor. We are looking to terminate. Can we terminate?	
2	What do I need to keep on file for former employees and for how long? Thanks!	
5	An employee (since August) wouldn't qualify for FMLA. One of his parents is sick. He's been going home and said he will work and he doesn't. He's used 6 sick days and is negative vacation. He leaves the team in a bad position. We are are looking at ending employment and you can reapply. He is in New York City - he isn't showing up half the time. He was hired in August.	
3	is there any verbiage for a company that regularly implements furloughs for employees due to gap in work based on projects (i.e. construction industry)	
4	We had an employee who has been here for about 5 months. It is just working out not to be a good fit for us. We are having a conversation with her on Friday to give her in writing all of the things she is not doing that are part of her job description. I'm the HR Manager and my suggestion is to give her a formal write-up with all these things on it and the owner was of the mindset that she did not want to embarrass her with a write-up.	
5	We have an employee who we hired in NH, we laid him off. He have contacted me because he's wanting his pay corrected because we withheld for SDI and he lives in NH. Additionally he is requesting that we do his final paycheck as EXEMPT. Can his final pay also be exempt from social security and medicare?	
5	It's about worker's comp. We have been wanting to terminate an employee for a while now and they are now on workers' comp. Can we terminate now? After he is finished and settled the WC claim, is there a way we can terminate him then? We believe he was stealing hours from the company. What if the WC claim is denied?	
3	I am calling on behalf of a client. They have a part time employee who recently quit. They wanted to know what they need to provide to him. Are they required to pay him for the two weeks? The employer is in Maryland.	
5	If I have an employee who is operating equipment for me who I found out is on Methadone am I in my rights to terminate this employee even if he has a script for this? He did not make us aware that he is on this drug, We found this out by a random drug screen we had preformed on him for suspicion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,	
1	We have two employees who have not been doing a good job for some time now. They have not been reprimanded regarding performance but we have hired their future replacements already. Should we give them 2 months notice that we will be terminating? We will not be offering severance.	
1	We have supplemental wages as it relates to severance. The employer can opt to withhold at the 25% supplemental rate. We are paying someones severance at the 25%, but the employee has requested that the severance be paid at the W-2 rate. Can we do that? If so, is there an issue with paying this severance payment in a manner that is inconsistent with how we normally pay our severance payments?	
1	We terminated an employee who did not show to work due to a criminal incarceration. We sent his termination letter via Certified mail to his home address on file and it was returned since nobody claimed it. What should the employer do in case of these certified mail are returned and we do not have any other contacts on record? Thanks	
0	Released an employee in Georgia and want to know if we are required to pay out their vacation.	
4	Employee assigned to Navy base for our client. Came to work with quantity of prescription med that is not permissible on the base, and an allegation that his car smelled like marijuana. He has been removed from the base per their policy, and we have only one other client to whom we can assign him, but he has already been dismissed by that client due to poor work performance. How should we manage as we have no other jobs for him? Another employee, in GA, was terminated for excessive absenteeism. She had been taking intermittent FMLA, and we excluded those absences from our attendance point system. She had several unexcused absences that led to termination. With advice from our counsel, she was given 5 days to provide a doctors note to excuse some of her absences and we will consider reinstatement. She provided doctors notes but it was well beyond the 5 day window. How should we manage?	
1	Can we possibly have a call to walk through? This seems like much more than Im familiar with providing. Lauri Grygon HR Operations Manager Alcresta Therapeutics, Inc. 15 Independence Blvd., 4th Floor Warren, NJ 07059 (o) 732-926-4821 (m) 908-403-6133 lgrygon@alcresta.com	
5	We wrote up an employee last week for attendance issue, including no call no shows. The next occurrence was to result in a termination. The last three days he was a no call no show. He emailed this morning asking if he still has a job. He states that he can furnish a note on Monday. Can we terminate him anyway?	
4	We have an employee who resigned, and on her resignation letter she has indicated that her final day would be Friday, November 10th. However, her normal schedule is Monday through Thursday. I'm concerned that the resignation letter states that her last day would be the 10th. How can we ensure that we do not have to pay her through the 10th? The employee was an exempt/salaried employee.	
3	1. The last day is being determined now - I believe it will be 12/31. However, KontrolFreek would like to reimburse or cover the COBRA cost for this employee. Will you let me know how that could work? 2.Explain the liabilities and if a severance package would be best. 3.Would the group need to issue the terminated employee a 1099 if the group decides to pay COBRA directly? 4.If they pay Cobra, this is like paying the employees health insurance. Will this be taxable on their W-2?	
2	This question is for our client Alliant Credit Union: Can you provide any guidance around severance packages and benefits? What is the norm? Do you have any sample severance package examples?	
4	Prior employee who was part of RIF, she and her father has sent us demand letters. These letters where sent largely via her father. She wants to have a conversation with our organization, and we had something schedule with our attorney. She's now saying that she is not available for the conversation. She wants to her father to be on the call in her place. Are we able to have that conversation with someone who was not in our employee? They are threatening to contact the media about how she was laid off if we do not pay her $25000.	
4	Via email: Good Afternoon, We have an employee that we acquired when we took over a Child Development Center. She has been a poor performer and we were preparing the documentation to terminate when she went on a worker's comp leave. The work injury was not related to our agency but rather an injury she already had. She is not seeing our doctors so we did not acquire her worker's comp case. That being said how risky is it to terminate her when she returns to work. Her salary is higher than we pay for this position, her performance is poor and she is bad mouthing the agency. We agreed to take these employees for 90 days so as not to disrupt service and the 90 days are up.	
6	Final pay question...if employee submits a letter of resignation and it's accepted. If we decide to cut the time short, do we have to pay through the notice period?	
1	New question asked to AP (add 5 minutes): We are not considering a round of salary reductions which would also impact the CEO. Would this reduce our risk?	
1	I'd like to get some advice on terminating an employee in CA. We terminated a CA last year around this time and missed the ball on some things. Want to make sure we have everything in order.	
1	We observed a union employee steeling copper and we have decided to terminate. We notified the union since we''re a subcontractor. We want to send him home now but will not be able to issue the check until the end of the day. Is that okay?	
6	On final checks due to a death in the State of Texas, who should the final wages be paid out to?	
5	We have an employee that is on vacation now. When he returns we plan on firing him for stealing time. He was assigned a time card --video he came in at 7:43 emailed and said that he forgot time card and asked clerk to clock him in at 7. We want to make sure we are not missing anything because there were no warnings because we are just finding out about this now.	
4	We want to terminate an employee due to lack of commitment, attention to detail, not grasping her responsibilities, etc. I also have concerns as she stated she's not sure this is the right place for her but God has placed her here and she wants to make it work. She also happens to be pregnant. Again, our reason for terminating is that she's not where we would expect her to be at this point. She is 60 days into her 90-day probationary period.	
1	Employee in our FL office. Regarding an employee who is on a PIP, on the 24th on October. We ran through the issues, there are about 7 plus issues. We are the end of this PIP, and he's been slow to improve with unsatisfactory improvement. He can't open a spreadsheet, marketing items seem immature. We are considering termination. What would be risk in his termination.	
1	We have eliminated a position we no longer need, a scheduler. We updated our phone tree and made other changes in processes that mean we have no work for him. On the notice of change in relationship, how should we categorize the separation? Termination or layoff?	
5	I have an employee that we are in the middle of a workers compensation claim. Initially he told me it was not work-related and he took a month off for disability. Half-way through he went to another doctor who said it was work-related and I contacted workers compensation and he is seeing the workers compensation doctor. We are now going through a layoff and he is one we are considering in the layoff because he does not have any additional skills.	
5	Did not deduct medical premiums from an employee for over 7 months. We caught the mistake and the employee has been paying us back up to her termination. He left the company and still owes us money. Can I take it out of his last check?	
4	Just spoke to an employee in Florida that was terminated from her assignment (and from the agency) because she complained about a manager speaking negatively about her. Client did not want her back because her behavior was bad. Agency told her that she should not go back to the client. Some employees of this company have filed a class action suit and this employee	
4	I have a part time employee who has been on leave since 2015. She was not covered under FMLA so we just let her go out on personal leave. She has been good about providing medical updates but we now need to fill the position. Can I do that?	
3	I have a full time employee on maternity leave until late July. I've found someone interested in temp work to fill her position until she returns. If I explicitly hire for temp position, and properly documented, does it mean the expected termination will not quality for unemployment claim? Is there some kind of documentation needed to show it's temp position? By the way, this interested person was employed once and resigned last year. Thank you.	
0	If an employee resigns in New York, are we obligated to pay out accrued vacation? We pay out if an employee is laid off.	
1	We are in GA we have a consultant that is a w-2 ee and I want to make sure that I am following MA guidance we are terminating.	
4	We have a union employee who is still within her six month probationary period. She was not performing and the manager spoke with her and now she is performing satisfactory. The supervisor wants to let her go because she is not a good fit. What are the risks?	
3	Our company is in California and I have a supervisor wanting to terminate for insubordination (for not following directives and posted work schedules). The employee has been employed for three years. What if they have a medical condition or their family member has a medical condition. Do we need to provide a reason for termination?	
3	Can I fire an employee for too much use of sick time?	
6	Hello. In California, regarding Final Pay, I'd like clarification. If an employee quits without notice, the employer has 72 hours to hand the employee his/her check unless employee authorized mailing it in writing. My question is if an employee quits right after the payroll/pay period processed and has Direct deposit, this means the employee is scheduled to be paid on the next pay date such as a Friday (not within the 72 hour hours). The problem with that is the ADP/Payroll Company can't guarantee ADP can draw the money back on the same day and it may take up to 5 days in which is too late or the employee could cash the money while the employer has issued a final manual check. Due to the problem with direct deposit, the inability to reverse or draw the money back in time due to the pay period, can the employer pay the current pay via final check, and let the direct deposit run as normal from the previous pay period to hit on the normal pay date? How do recommend to solve this?	
3	If I have an employee to turned in there resignation, but if the company decides to let this employee go early; will they be entitled to file for unemployment?	
1	Final Pay & Termination Good morning, Can you tell me if we need to pay a minimum, or physical time on site for terminating an employee? For example, we had an employee come to our office this morning vs. going to their assigned work location. Do we need to compensate them for the time at the office? If so, do we pay them for the time they were physically here meeting? Or is there a state (TX) minimum we have to pay them for coming in?	
3	2 EE who displayed unusual behavior and asked them to submit to drug testing. Both refused. The company has a formal policy on reasonable suspicion and states refusal is termination. One employee admitted to using drugs and said he need help. Can they still terminate?	
3	Hello - Can an employer offer a furlough leave and have the employees still working part-timer?	
4	On of our groups has a terminated employee. Her last day was in April. She was a new hire and benefits would have been available May 1st. She was terminated on May 5th. She did not work at all in the month of May. Should she have benefits for the month of May? What date should her termination date be?	
6	An employee passed away during the weekend. How should we process his final paycheck? He was on direct deposit. Do you have any resources for grief counseling?	
3	Employee terminated today; cleaned out desk and when sorting papers found documents such as application for welfare that we	
6	I have two employees that are getting terminated this month. They owe us money for employee portion of their benefits. I'd like to speak to someone so I can explain to the employees why final amount is different on their final paycheck for the benefits portion. The employees are in Arizona. Can you send the federal information? The enrollment forms only have the per pay period amount - are you saying that the employees are not/have not authorized the additional deduction?	
4	Hello, Can you please assist with the below question we receive from a client? An employee had already spent all the money she had planned to have withheld from her paychecks for 2017 at the time of her termination. TASC is billing Excel Technologies for the remainder of those uncollected funds. Is there any reason why Excel Technologies can't legally withhold those funds, which she's already spent, from her final paychecks? Thank you!	
4	1 of 2 - had hired someone on 4-26. She was supposed to start the floor orientation toady. She can already can't make it today. She did one day of orientation. How can I rescind this offer? Is there a letter I can send to her stating this will no work?	
4	We have an employee in Maryland and the acting manager was working with another manager and decided to terminate an employee. The district manager and I agreed that we should; however, we did not have enough documentation to terminate. I spoke to the employee and she felt that it was not right. I told her that she could come back if she wanted to. She was hired as a keyholder. Are we legally bound to hire her back to the same position? The manager did not get all her ducks in a row and she had a couple of no calls, no shows and she was told to bring in medical documentation and stated that she would and the manager stated that it would not have mattered.

4	We have an exempt employee we suspended on Friday. She was not informed as why she was she was being suspended and she wants to know why she was terminated. We suspended her for mishandling funds. She was to have been terminated May 10th. She called today to give her two weeks notice, and that her last day would be May 22nd. Should be terminate her to let her resignation stand?	
3	Are there any issues with terminating an employee who just returned from work comp and is on light duty? This person has multiple attendance issues and policy violations.	
1	We have under 50 employee's that are being laid off. Are we subjec to the WARN Act. Also, what should the notification say?	
4	Im a manager and I hired someone that was to start 5/1. We are at-will, she signed her offer letter and everything seemed fine. On Monday the 1st she called in and said she had a family emergency. We moved her start date to May 2nd, in which she was in new hire orientation all day, but she worked on the 2nd. Then she called in sick Wed-Fri, saying her child was sick. She asked if she could restart on Monday. We agreed, but today she called in sick again, this time she said she is sick. We want to talk about the possibility of termination.	
3	Other than the below, is there any other information the employer should be aware of when an employee rescinds their resignation?Is there anything else the employer needs to consider during this process? On occasion, an employee may wish to revoke the notice of resignation. Revocation of the resignation notice is treated on a case-by-case basis; supervisors should consult with the department of human resources. There is no guarantee that the employee may return to the same position.	
4	An employee is continually insubordinate with a very poor attitude, acting as if she owns the company. May we terminate her for insubordination?

1	We have a maintenance/janitor that we would like to layoff. We have been outsourcing some of the tasks assigned to this position over the past year. At this point it makes economic sense to outsource all of the tasks and layoff the employee. The employee is currently out on workers' compensation for an injury sustained when he walked into a door. Do we have to let him return to work where he may sustain another injury? Can we layoff the employee while he is out on workers' compensation? Do we have any exposure since the employee is over 70 years old?	
5	We have temporary employee who has taken out a restraining order against his ex-girlfriend how has charged him with domestic violence.

5	I have an employee that has had an anger blow ups on job sites but is not aware that he is doing that as far as he didn't think he was that loud. He has been insubordinate with a supervisor.. A supervisor had asked him do something and he said hell no. I have had a talk and wrote him up for insubordination. I told him I'd give him a second chance. He has caused scenes in the workplace before. No one in the company wants to work with him. I just need to know the best way to handle the situation. I let him off today with pay to reflect on conversation and give it a day. He responded to the Manager by email and apologized for his behavior at length. Tomorrow the employer will terminate the employee for insubordination and an angry outburst on the worksite. Can the employer withhold $200 from final pay if employee does not return company paid tools and shirts?	
0	An employee passed away. His last day was Friday or Saturday. We had gone ahead and paid. We didn't pay his beneficiary the vacation. Why, I don't know. Do we have to pay his estate waiting time penalties? Is there a deadline as to issue the final vacation wages?

He sent a text today stating he was coming to terms with his illness, and has been working off hours. I again asked him to contact us via phone at 10:00am.

She also did not extend her STD benefits so we do not believe she was disabled.

3	I want to terminate an employee who is on salary, pay them tomorrow morning.	
2	We have a policy that if an employee doesn't show up or notify for us 3 consecutive days in a row, that is considered voluntary resignation. Do you have a sample letter that I can send to the employee to document the situation? No-call No-show sample? The third day that employee did not show up was an approved time off. Can we count that as the 3 consecutive days even though it was approved prior to missing the 2 no call no show's?

The employee has been spoken to by her manager regarding her performance issues and behavior (vulgar language) during these first two months she has been employed and the employee has been disgruntled about her job. The employer wants to exercise at will termination because of these reasons and because of the invalid UI claim.

2	1) Looking to do a RIF for just one employee as overstaffed. Want to offer one month of COBRA premium subsidy. Any issues with this? 2) Have seen some severance agreements go through but do not see any termination letters. Do you have any templates?	
6	Do you have a sample template that we can use when calculating an employee's final pay check?	
5	I have an employee who has just made his 30 days with us. He was a no show yesterday. His supervisor received a text saying he had an emergency with his mother in Idaho and he will be going to help her for a week or so and will follow up after his mom's surgery. My question is we are 30 days in and approaching our busiest season. Do we wait and call it no call no show even though we know he won't be in?	
6	Employee terminated and he owes the company money for property damage and some missing items. Can we recoup the full cost or is there a limit on what we can deduct from his final pay?

5	An employee resigned on Friday with no advanced notice. We understand the 72-hour rule, but does that mean he must have his check in hand within 72-hours?	
1	Termination in CA. We processed final pay immediately, Commission gets paid due diligence, gave him what we estimated right away. Went above and beyond what we felt was fair. We offer two weeks severance as a standard, for the safe return of company assets. We provided the FedEx boxes to pick up the device. The laptop arrived broken in half. Procurement says the employee included a note that states FedEX had to repackage the box because he didn't have enough packing tape. We don't want to give severance to him because of the breach of dismissal contract. What risks would we face by withholding the severance?	
5	Would like to discuss with Christina--now he is harassing me on social media. He's still employed. After the investigation, I sent him a very brief email. He told me not to text him anymore, which is why I emailed. A couple of days ago, he emailed me requesting all his sick time paid out. We have a policy that sick time is only used when scheduled or booked, which he wasn't. I sent him the policy and explained he was not eligible. He didn't like the response and emailed me 3 more. "Be a good girl and follow the law for once. I'm the victim here." I told him I would no longer correspond. I posted on my social media - #metoo where one of my managers sexually assaulted me. He wrote on my post "sad you won't help others... now you abuse other victims of violence... so sad." I blocked him on social media. He posted on the CEO's page that he would know "money buys silence." Can we fire him? He declined to use our online calendar and will only accept assignments through email and he's not trying to get hours with us. He (the CEO) wants to know at what point is this is harassment. What will be the reason for termination?	
1	follow up to the Severance pay question... we gave severance pay to employees that were laid off in March. This time we are not paying any severance to all the employees being laid off because the company is not in a position financially to make severance payments. will this be considered discriminatory?	
1	We have an employee who is leaving today. She does not have enough to cover her premium payment. What can the employer do in this regard? Can we deduct this? Our business will be closing, so we will be laying off employees. What will happen to employee benefits when we close down?	
1	If we are letting a person go in the state of WA with a 2-week severance, do we need to have their final check and severance available at the time of notification/signing?	
5	I called an employee who had been sent home for being under the influence while at work. We had previously counseled and warned him on showing up under the influence and the next time would lead to termination. I terminated by phone but failed to hang up my Bluetooth. If he overheard anything, can that be used against me? All I did after the call was communicate to this manager that I had spoken to him, we would be processing the termination and that he woudl not be back. Could this be used against me?	
2	Paperwork required at the time of termination	
4	We received a resignation letter today from an employee who stated her last day wanted to be December 1st. Can we change her last day to be the 30th of November instead of December 1st?

1	We are Texas. We have a full time employee who turn in a 6 weeks notice, stating her final day would be 12/31/17. We have been recruiting to fill her position, and may be able to have someone start on 12/16. If this is the case, and we decide to make 12/15 the employee's final day, would we be obligated to pay her through 12/31?	
1	We have about 62 employee, and about 55 are clinically trained employees. We have a new hire who was clinically trained but we are seeing some huge gaps with this employee. Gaps in ability to follow up with patients. We put together a PIP and things have gotten worse. We did not catch this in the interview process. Are we okay with proceeding with termination? Are we okay to provide her with pay through the end of the month?	
5	We payed the employee a per Diem last paycheck of $550.00 to travel. He was suppose to travel yesterday, but didn't and he was a no call no show today. We are terminating him. Can we deduct that amount from his final paycheck?	
5	We had a situation at one of our stores where our employee spoke very inappropriately to a customer (in a sexual manner), when talked to about it, he got upset and almost physical with another employee. The other employees in the store said he was acting very erratically and thought he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. It really sounds like grounds for termination, but that is a sticky situation in CA. What can we do to protect our customers and employees in this situation?	
3	Hi, In the State of IL: If an employee quits voluntarily with a two week notice - is the Employer required to accept the two weeks or can the Employer state that the date of the notice would be the actual last day? I realize IL is an At Will State but am not sure about this. Thank you!	
5	We have an individual who resigned/terminated with us last Friday. He had signed an external agreement for training costs that exceed $500 or more that if he left prior to a certain date, he would repay that amount. We are trying to figure out if we can deduct that from his final pay. The employee is in Colorado.	
3	We have a client who has a project they need help with. They are planning to hire a temporary directly and are wondering if they don't have work for them after the project is done and need to end the assignment (probably 1-3 months) would the employee be able to get unemployment insurance?	
4	I'm coming to the end of a Performance Improvement Plan for one of my employees. I plan to let her go but I would prefer that she find another job so I don't have to terminate her. Is there a way I can tell her that without put my company at risk?	
5	Marijuana is now legal in CA. We have a strict no drug policy and cannot allow any employee to be under the influence while at work. It was reported that one employee was smoking marijuana in a company vehicle on a worksite during work hours. We brought all three employees in and asked if they would agree to a random drug test, that we had reasonable suspicion that one or more were under the influence. Two employees said yes, the other one, (the one we suspected said no). He said hes not going to pass, that he smokes marijuana and has for years. He refused the test. We sent him home and had him stay home the next day while we figured out what to do. He is due back today. Can we terminate him? If so, we dont want to have high unemployment rates, can we contest?	
2	My company is going though financial struggles should I terminate or layoff? What's the difference?

5	We let an employee (California) who was having a lot of emotional outbursts after 2 years. His attorney writes to us stating he had offered to resign and that ADA discrimination could apply and that his resignation is invalid. She would like him to be reinstated and be allowed to go on FMLA. We asked for a note for him to return and he simply provided a release, but then he had another outburst, he would yell out things. 4 employees complained. He was upset with the system and went into the bathroom and had conversations with a friend about being suicidal. He discussed he did not know why we weren't letting him go. He yelled he wouldn't go outside because the police were out there. We told him we couldn't handle it, and we offered accommodation if he had a note. We knew he had a medical condition. He never asked for accommodation. His priest, friend and sister all called me.

4	We just hired an individual on January 25th 2017. She is part time and has worked maybe 5 days for us. She called her supervisor explaining that she had injured her knee prior to the hire and needed to see her doc and get an MRI. She followed up the call with a note from the doctor saying she should staff off her knee until the results of the MRI. Her job is 99% using her knee. She cleans and walks dogs etc for the shelter. Today her supervisor received this email.....Just received results- medial meniscus tear in left knee. Waiting for doc to send referral to orthopedic surgeon to discuss options- surgery, pt, etc. I requested a note for your records. Based on what the nurse said, I shouldn't be on my feet until I meet with orthopedic specialist. I'm super bummed but glad I went in before it got worse. Please let me know how you would like to proceed. Can we release her (at-will)? We really don't have anything for her to do sitting down.	
4	An employee had just enrolled in the Dependent Care FSA account with an effective date of Feb 1. She suddenly resigned as of Monday, Feb 6. She feels that we should not deduct the FSA Dependent Care contribution amount from her final check, nor should we deduct her group health benefit premium, which will continue through the end of the month. February 6 is the start of a new pay period. How should we manage?	
4	A part-time employee submitted a written 2 week notice of resignation. She was scheduled to work 3 days a week for both of the two weeks. After one week, the director told her not to come back. Do we need to pay her for the 3 days she was scheduled to work in her final week?

4	We have an employee who has been out many times, and has been written up in the past (excessive absenteeism and improper notification). This employee has been written up Aug, Nov, and January for improperly notifying her manager of her absence. We have a clear policy about reporting absences (must "speak to your manager") and she has texted or will call in and say I don't feel well now and will be in later. Sometimes she has doctor notes and sometimes she does not. She was out times in January and one time in February. The last write up we went over everything so that there could be no issue or misunderstanding. She did the same thing again this week and today we terminated her. She has never stated a need for accommodation, hasn't asked for a leave or anything.	
3	We will be closing one of our restaurants for 3 to 4 weeks this spring for some construction and remodeling and are wondering what our options for our employees may be regarding leave of absence, unemployment etc. Also, how will this impact their insurance participation if they are part of the group plan.	
3	We have an employee who gave notice he is a manger so they want to let him go a week early. Can they do this?	
3	I have a small employer group that had an employee quit on 2/6/17. The worked during that week. When terminating the Kaiser coverage with that date the coverage will cancel at midnight on 2/28/17. The group has already paid premium for the month of February so how do they collect the employee portion of his premium? If the employee does not want to pay their portion of premium can the Employer terminate coverage effective 1/31/2017 instead? What is the best way to handle this situation?	
6	Venue Book; Lisa Castillo lcastillo@avlgrowth.com 303-956-5803 We termed an employee yesterday and JustWorks has it in their system as today's date. I was wondering if they need to get a direct deposit of their final pay sooner than the usual pay date which is 2/15. This is for New York law	
2	Can you send me a sample Severance Agreement?	
6	We have a job abandonment policy. If an employee violates that policy, it is considered a voluntary resignation. In California, when would the final check be due?

6	We received a wage complaint from the state of Texas. An employee is stating that we over deducted for his group benefits when we actually didn't. We make deduction in advance so on his final paycheck in December, we deducted for January coverage. Is there a problem with doing this?

However, when we added him to our insurance the agent said he is uninsurable due to prior DUI. Can we terminate him due to uninsurablity?	
5	A Texas employee started with us on December 12th. We give new sales people a 3 month, non-recoverable draw and that it must be repaid if the employee leaves within the year. He resigned on Tuesday. Can we deduct the draw from final pay? He quit without notice. On this check he would be getting accrued, unused PTO. He's received about $16,000 towards $33,000 and $4,300 in reimburseables. He would still owe us $5,300 if we could make the deductions. Or, do we pay him what we owe and pursue him for the rest?	
2	Does your site contain salary survey information? I am also looking for information regarding exit interviews.	
4	We have an employee who we suspected was under the influence on the job. Our policy states we can conduct reasonable suspicion drug testing. She agreed to go for a drug screen, but indicated she would probably test positive. He did test positive for opiates and oxytocin. We are planning to terminate, however, I wanted to double check to be sure Pennsylvania did not have anything that would require us to provide her with rehab options.	
4	An employee is on PFL for bonding with her newborn. She wants to return on a PT status only. We do not have any PT positions available. Can we terminate her? Another EE wants to work a second job in our company. Would we need to include all hours in both jobs when determining OT and DT?

6	I terminated an employee in the office today however, when I went to get his final paycheck, someone had already placed the check in the mail. The employee has since left.

6	I have an employee who resigned. When are his final wages due, what needs to be included and what documents are required at termination in California?	
4	We have an employee who was accused of drug use at work because some drug paraphernalia was found in the restroom. We have not proof this was hers, however. She was just recently in a very bad accident, where her 10 year old son was killed. She is in the hospital, and her boyfriend who was driving was arrested. Her older son posted on social media that she is a drug addict, and that the grandparents have taken the older son. She may be able to return to work in a few weeks, however, the salon manager does not want her back, and wants to terminate her employment.	
5	We have an employee who abandoned his position on a Saturday night, Then posted a public message saying he was disgruntled abut pay and was moving on. Then on the following Tuesday his attorney contacted us stating he had a open workers' comp claim. This employee had continued to contact me (not his attorney). Typically when an attorney is involved we only have communications through the attorney. Would like to get some advice on best practice. The GM responded to the employee on the electronic message board in an unprofessional manner. It's a board that is private only to employees of this location. It's not open to the public.	
6	We have an employee who passed away over the weekend and wondering who we release his final paycheck to.	
4	We have an employee who has excessive absenteeism. She has also been challenging in other ways. We were accommodation her restrictions due to an off the job injury and moved her to a different location which could accommodate her restrictions. She really didn't want to go. She kept calling in sick, didn't go for the training day as planned. She did go to the location and on her first day at this site she fell and filed a workers' compensation claim. She has been returned to work but we feel she is a liability and unreliable. We are considering terminating her. Would like to get a second opinion.	
5	We spoke with THR previously regarding an employee who had called on previously. We waited to see if the employee was incarcerated and this did prove to be the case. His spouse has confirmed that he has been arrested and we will be moving forward with termination. How should we handle his signature on our eternal separation forms as he is not available? His wife will be coming by for a meeting to drop off his laptop and company cell phone are we okay to provide her his final paycheck.	
3	It's regarding maternity leave and job protection. Division with 9-10 will be divested and employee will go with the new company; if this employee is among the impacted employees who will be terminated; some of who may be offered jobs. Will the employer have any issues with discrimination?	
1	We have got a situation where I have a 13 year employee and we have not been happy with performance. We had him make two critical errors to a tune of 160,000 and we had some issues with our PNL. We are trying to correct the issue right now. We told the employee that we are evaluating the situation formerly. I discussed this our management team. I can outright terminate this employee. I want to sit them down and amicably and offer a severance package and decide terminate. Am I in the legalities can I offer a conditional severance? These issues have come up over the past three to four years and we have addressed it and provided verbal or written warning. These are job performance issues. Usually the person will never apologize for the mistakes. She states that she has too much work load and when we try to bring someone one she says she does not need someone to help.	
2	Is an employee's (voluntary) termination date the last day of employment or the day after the last day worked? Thank you!

6	We have an employee who passed away and we have a final paycheck we need to issue. In order to give the final paycheck to their beneficiary (spouse), is there a particular form that must be completed in order for us to release that final paycheck. Also, we are in the state of California. Secondly, is there a specific dollar amount limit that we can provide the beneficiary or is there a limitation that we need to pay attention to given that we are in California. Would you share any other regulations we need to consider: time limits? forms? signatures? notifications? etc.	
6	If an employee has an outstanding note payable, and they voluntarily quit, can we deduct the amount owed from the employees final paycheck?	
2	At time of termination? At time of notification or actual termination date. So if we give notice on Wednesday but the pay through date is Friday..... money can be delivered on Friday?	
5	We have an employee that just came in and gave his 2 weeks notice. Now since he has given the notice, he has been talking with the other employees about it and creating problems. If we asked him to leave now prior to his 2 weeks notice, would it be classified as a termination and would we have to pay unemployment benefits? Also, what is the current maximum number of weeks for employees to obtain unemployment benefits in Wisconsin?	
1	When someone resigns, and we want to let them to leave that day, do we have to pay them through the two weeks?	
4	RE: STEVENS We have an employee that was written up for insubordination on Oct. 18th. She immediately sent an email tendering her resignation, but within the hour rescinded her resignation. The write-up said they would meet again in 30 days to discuss the status, but there has been no change in behavior. They are wanting to let her go at the end of the month. However they are wondering if they can tell her they are wanting to accept her resignation now or if they should just terminate her employment because it is not working out?	
2	We are looking for verbiage. We accidentally double paid a terminated employee. It's a CA employee. The payment was sent the 7th of November. Looking for verbiage on a letter collect the over payment. Do you have a sample letter?

The employee's boyfriend went into the employee's email and sent an email to the employer from her account slandering her. She called off and she wasn't sick, not a good person, said things about her character. They brought her in today to talk to her about the email. He kicked the employee out of the house - overbearing, possessive, etc. Supposedly she is off to get a restraining order today.	
0	We had an employee submit his resignation on November 17, but he is stating effective 12/1. I understand in Minnesota, PTO/Vacation pay is contractual and the employer can set to policies. Our policy is a two week notice to be paid earned PTO/Vacation. However, Im not sure about a resignation like this. It is a two week notice of sorts, but I dont think he had any intention to work two weeks (nor do we want him to do so) and he hasnt asked to use Vacation. My question is are we required to pay him through December 1 (or November 30, our monthly pay day for salary employeees)? Or can we accept his termination as of November 17 and only pay to that point? Im checking Minnesota refs and I cant find an answer. Thanks for your assistance! Have a great Thanksgiving holiday!	
6	I had received a response back from Amy regarding deducting wages from the terminated employee of property that they must return to us. According to Illinois law. The deduction must be signed and agreeable at the time the deduction is made. This is what is in our handbook. Will this be ok or do we have to have them sign one at the end. "An employee will be required to sign the Wage Deduction Authorization Agreement to deduct the costs of Company items from the final paycheck, if such items are unreturned upon termination of employment."

6	What is the timing for paying a final paycheck. This individual quit and our payroll is next Wednesday. California. I believe they quit yesterday. Today he was a no call no show.	
5	We had an employee who on Monday gave his two weeks notice. Today he come today and is refusing to work. If we tell him to leave and not come back, is it still considered to be a resignation?	
1	We're updating our handbook - with regard to monthly premiums for health insurance: our employees are paid biweekly. If an employee leaves at the beginning of the month can we double deduct premiums? Employees are in Missouri.	
3	Found out this morning about an incident involving an employee who came forward to their manager about substance abuse. Was sent home by the manager as was concerned about being under the influence of alcohol. Employee admitted to drinking on the job. Can we terminate? What are best practices?	
4	We have an employee who left us a bit ago, and before she leave we knew that she had an issue with another employee. She was a temp and then became our receptionist. She was in another area and was having an issue with another employee. It was petty issues, about certain words or tone used. We suggested they talk it out. They vented about each other to other employee, which made it worse. We asked they they not do this. The one employee has been with us a long time. Our next step was to move the new employee. The employee has filed an UI claim with the TWC stating that she had to quit b/c of harassment.	
4	an employee said she was retiring and now is stating she has changed her mind. We made company changes based on the first information. We are a real estate company in NYC.	
5	Wilkins Automotive (Tamara) JWilkins@wilkinsautomotive.com 410.960.6191 I have a general sales manager that I have a compensation package with. We guaranteed him a certain amount and he has under performed. I do not have an end date. Do I have to pay him out throughout the end of the year. They normally work on commission and we offer a straight salary for a certain amount of time; in which we offer him a salary.	
3	Are there any implications in terminating an individual while filing their workman's compensation claim due to the severity of the accident that they had and the fact that it was DOT reportable?	
1	Can we layoff our lowest performing employee who is employed in one region, due to over-staffing, then hire someone else for a different region? Do we have to offer the employee we are considering to layoff, the position we are hiring for?	
5	A new employee (less than 3 months) who mentioned he used to be a hockey player and has a herniated disk. He was asking if he should stay at work or go home. She told him to report back to work, he disagreed and said he would call. He called at 11 (he was supposed to be in at 9). He called and said he was going to go to the chiropractor. He did not show up on Saturday. He texted the store manager 30 minutes after he was scheduled to come in because his girlfriend was suicidal and he could not leave her alone. On Sunday he was scheduled to come in, the key employee made arrangements for another employee to come in. He was sent home since he was not calling in. Today he showed up 15 minutes (forgot his wallet) later (he called) as if nothing never happened. The store manager wants to know if we can just let him go? The text Saturday sounded like a goodbye text. There was no conclusion to the text - he didn't say he would be in the next day. He is not eligible for sick leave yet.	
3	Can someone be terminated in Michigan when they are on STD, if they have no FMLA protection since they have been employed less than one year? The company is doing a reduction in workforce and would like to include this person.	
1	We are going through some layoffs due to funding issues. I was hoping to get some information on the minimum requirements for paperwork to document the layoff. We were over 50 employees last time we did this, we gave a month of severance, a general release of claims. We have 33 employees now. Do we have to comply with the OWBPA requirements if we pay severance but do not require a waiver?	
2	Disability- Pregnancy Good Morning- We are having layoffs at our company and included in there is a woman on maternity leave. (we have consulted our legal council). I would like to provide her with all her options for claiming disability fir the dilation of what would have been her leave. Are you able to send to me the best options for her/how to?

5	We have an employee in Tennessee who we hired as a regional sales manager. We have some negative feedback about him from from clients, however, this has never been addressed with him. In the meantime, the employee who left the company prior to this new hire (who was hired to fill the vacancy) had informed us that he is again available and would like to return to the company. Senior management wants to hire this individual back (he had been with the company for many years) and terminate the new hire.	
3	I have someone who informed me they are putting in a resignation on 12/18 and they want their last day to be Jan 2nd. We pay for the holiday week and I don't want to pay them if they are not going to be returning after the holiday. I want to accept their resignation. What are the options? Do I have to pay them the final week? Can I just accept their resignation the day the give it? Would like to discuss options.	
5	My client has a chronically underperforming staff member (multiple documented issues). She happens to be approaching 65 years old. We've talked about progressive discipline and setting up goals and deadlines, with the consequence for not meeting goals being a reduction in work hours. He is worried about age discrimination if he outright terminates her, since the other receptionist is younger, newer, and happens to be more productive. He would INCREASE her hours. He asked if he should just offer a severance package to the underperforming employee in return for agreeing not to pursue any legal action?? I'm not sure I agree with this approach, but told him I'd ask about it. What would you say? Bess	
1	We are a CA employer, with less than 20 employees. We just terminated an EE, the healthcare company sent her cal-COBRA. EE has come back and asked about COBRA federal reimbursement up to 65%. We believe this law has expired. Can you confirm?	
3	What depth can I have an employee sign a contract? When we are terminating someone at the time of termination they are telling us that they were not paid accurately in the past (i.e they were not provided a meal break).	
3	1. Separation agreements: in the past I have given hard copies and for this one it has to be emailed the person will sign and then return to us. can they do this.? Can they do this in RI? There is a place for company and employee to sign does it matter who signs first.	
5	We have an employee who currently is on a medical leave due to an injury (on his own time). We want to terminate him for poor job performance. Can we terminate him while he is out on his leave? They have reorganized the department and won't need him any longer. Additional Information: He is a relative of the owner so hes been allowed to remain out. He isnt receiving pay and is collecting unemployment. We keep asking for a doctor's note and aren't getting anything; I don't think he clearly understands the situation. He's been out since August 9th of 2017.	
1	We are terminating our Director of Engineering today. We are at-will employer. Executive team wants to end it with no reason. What can I say to push back, as I think we should add more detail?	
5	CFO wants to terminate an employee hired in Accounting in February. He has an MBA however his skill set is so basic as to only constitute clerical skills. CFO has stated that he has spoken to the employee however there is no documentation. CFO states he has been given guidance and is unable to perform the duties after being given guidance. Employee states that he has asked the CFO for guidance and has not been given guidance. Former CFO experiences the employee as being "slow". It's regarding terminating an employee. Would like to speak to someone.	
2	What is common for a business of our size in regards to a severance policy? Different for with termination cause and without cause?	
3	I have a question on a drug tests. How do I proceed with positive marijuana when legal in the state? This is for WA	
5	We have an employee caught stealing money from a cash register on video. He is only 17 and a half y.o.. Does that change anything on how we should proceed for his dismissal? Do we need to contact his parents? Thanks.	
5	Our client is a trucking company. One of their employees, a truck driver, was scheduled to pick up a truck on Saturday. The employee's wife called a different employee of the same company and told him that her husband (the employee in question) had been drinking. Employee has previous alcohol abuse issues. The client called the employee in question and he admitted he had been drinking. The client sent him home and terminated him this morning. Even though the termination already happened, are there any considerations the client should make in this case?	
0	We have in our policy that if terminating we do not pay out vacation if 2 week's notice is not given. Employee is contesting this saying that payment is due even though he did not give proper notice. The handbook he signed (old version) notes that payment is due regardless but the new handbook (which he received but didn't sign for) removes pay upon termination if proper notice isn't given. What does Colorado law state?	
3	On our severance agreement that we have entered into with a now former employee, under the severance portion section two, the employer agrees to pay two weeks of wages and medical benefits. An employee was terminated on the 11/20 which means she will be covered until 12/1. We had an initial severance agreement initially reviewed by legal counsel and then were using this template. In this situation, would the employer then be responsible for paying for two weeks of coverage through December, or two weeks of COBRA?	
3	How long do we have to keep an employee after they return from FMLA?	
4	I have an employee that I will be letting go and I have a strong feeling that she is not answering my phone. If she does not answer what should I do? Would it be advisable to send her check in the mail? If she does not answer do I have to pay her for tomorrow?	
5	An employee was in one of our households. An employee has been off work and we have heard back - he left on Wednesday - he was not done with his shift and has not returned. Can we just send final pay to the State? Would there be any waiting penalties owed? He was texted by the owner on Thursday that he was considered to have resigned - do we owe a waiting penalty? If we pay a penalty for Thursday through Monday - do we count Monday? Is it ok to include the waiting time on the same final check? He always get 8 regular plus 2 overtime - would I do the same for the daily rate including the 2 overtime?	
3	We have an employee who was termed for excessive absences and tardiness. I got notification that she filed for unemployment and one question is whether we advised the employee prior to these absences whether unemployment benefits would be denied. Was I supposed to do that?	
3	Received a request for an employment verification for a current employee. Can we terminate him for this?	
4	Employee interviewed in Nov 2016, she said was available FT - 32-36 hours. We made her a tentative offer, during construction. When we opened the shop on 2/4/17, the first day she only attended 2 hours of training, and then went home. She didn't come back until the 4th day. She worked the full day then left, stating due to medical reasons she can only work 3 days a week, 4 hours each day. She brought in a medical slip from doctor. We kept going at 4 hours/3 days for 4 months, then she wanted 5 hours and alternate days. She has been very negative in the salon, talks negative. She leaves early many days. I warned her and she stopped for a couple months. One day she called off sick. Against our policy, need advanced notice and arrange for a backup. She texts and never arranges back up. She is not reliable. Now, we have a customer complaint that she treated him rudely, telling him to sit up straight, hold still, etc. Other customers overhead as well as one of the salon managers. Im trying to decide if I have enough to terminate. She also clocks in more time than what is worked. She is including the time it takes, to clean the work station after completing her principle activity, and to put on her coat and gather her purse. Do I have to pay based on what an employee puts on their time sheet?	
6	We have an employee that passed away suddenly, What steps do we need to take to issue the final paycheck to the beneficiary or estate? Do we need a death certificate to issue the final paycheck to the estate/beneficiary? Are there any Nevada states regulations we need to be aware of besides not deducting the FIT?	
6	A warehouse employee was pulled over speeding and will be deported as a result. We received a note authorizing future payments to be made to a family member (has employee signature). How do we pay out final pay? This happened a week ago but just found out...do we need to pay more since the 72 hour rule applies?	
4	Follow up: She wants an email. I am sending a Fedex stating she is not taking her calls and that she is being terminated. I am documenting that she needs to indicate what to do with her final check. Can I turn off all of her access? I will pay her through her tomorrow to be safe. Can I terminate her access? We do not want her to come into the office because it will be adversarial. Should I state we are paying her through tomorrow in the letter? I have the check and she obviously does not want to meet with us. I know she is going to cause problems - can I email her?	
0	We're terminating an employee in California. Do we need to pay out a floating holiday in addition to PTO accruals?	
2	An employee has been absent from work for the last several days. No call / no show. We have a job abandonment policy stating job abandonment after 2 days of no call no show. Can we send him a letter of termination via email?	
3	Jacob Gyllenstierna, jacob@peek.com, 415-806-7338 Employee lost his work authorization so his last day was yesterday; H-1B extension was denied by the government, even after an appeal. What obligations does the employer have for this termination?	
5	I received several screen shots via text message from an employee's ex-girlfriend stating that this employee is doing drugs and drinking on the job. These screen shots are conversations between said employee and the girlfriend. He is openly admitting to doing these things and sent pictures of himself in the company vehicle. He is also stating to her that other employees that he names are doing these things with him on company time. Is this enough to terminate this employee immediately & is this enough to send the other employees for a drug and alcohol test?	
0	We are going through a process of possible layoffs. We are looking at our vacation payout responsibility and are curious as to how this may affect employees' unemployment benefits. Will their award from the state be reduced based on the amount of vacation paid out?	
6	1 of 2: We have an employee in Texas and we are located in Missouri. If we are terminating the employee for job performance issues by when do we have to have their final check? Can I deduct from the exempt employees wages in the final week of pay? He had a kidney transplant last year and our CEO gave notice to the employee about their performance issues. We do evaluate sales based on metrics. He has been with us for four years.	
1	We will be terminating an employee for poor performance and would like to discuss how the process needs to go.	
1	We hired an individual for a VP Sales position, however, his performance is not up to par, so we are planning to terminate his employment this afternoon. We have had previous conversations with him about his performance issues. We are planning to provide him with a severance of two weeks pay (and are considering this as a policy moving forward for senior level positions). We have a termiantion agreement (severance agreement) that was composed by legal counsel for a sister company that we are using for this separation. Do you see any red flags with this situation? Can we choose to pay him his bonus for current business (even though our policy states the outgoing employee would not be eligible)? What about paying for two weeks of health coverage?	
2	femal e 42 yrs. performance is declining. Q:	
1	One more. Does termination date and pay through date represent the same thing? I am just trying to make sure we appropriate pay wages at the right time. We are notifying our employee on 11/30 and prefer that to be his termination date, yet paying him through 12/1. Can we do that. The wages and unused vacation will be deposited on Thursday, available Friday. Or do we have to make his termination date 12/1 because the money will not be available until then. If paid through equal terminations then I can do what we want which is notify and termination 11/30 and pay through 12/1.	
5	I have an employee who is an installer. Goes into peoples homes. About a week and a half ago there was an article in the paper that he was chased by police in our company vehicle broke into someone's home and attempted to steal. I need to know, can we let him go for this or do we need to wait for conviction? It was while he was on the clock. Employee in Alabama. He is not in jail. He has not been at work.	
4	We have to terminate an employee out on Workers Comp. 50% of job is physical. She has a back injury. Been out 90 days. The doctor can't give us a time frame for when she will return and we need to fill this position. Would like to discuss termination letter.	
6	Employee is voluntarily resigning, last day tomorrow. We are issuing his final paycheck as a live check, but can we pay his PTO as a direct deposit, that will hit his bank account tomorrow?	
3	What are our options to adjust a resignation date when the date falls in the first few days of a month (thus qualifying the employee for an add'l month of employer paid benefits coverage)? Is the answer different if the employee has given more than the requested 30 days notice?	
3	Is two years long enough to keep an employee after they file for Workman's Comp claim where they have not missed any work?	
3	I work for private firm that three men own. Every time someone quits they want to just fire them. We have a sales employee that put in 2 weeks and owner says they want her gone now. I said that's fine but we have to pay her out for the two weeks, otherwise that could be seen as retaliation. I just want to make sure that is correct.	
3	Termination - client in GA hired a seasonal employee. He has been written up for not following instruction, and is considered lazy. They want to be prepared for possible unemployment. Should they mention this was a seasonal position?	
5	An employee with 36 years tenure will be incarcerated for several years effective with his sentencing date in January. Per our union agreement, we will allow a 30-day personal leave of absence prior to the date he has to turn himself in. Can we terminate his employment at the end of the 30 days because of his sentencing, and if so, how is that classified?	
3	If an employee advised verbally that he will not return to work although was medically released, can the employer ask for a written resignation? How long do they give him to turn it in? What is their recourse if he refuses to submit a written resignation?	
3	Our summer and winter guide staff sign work agreements at the beginning of their season with start and end dates. After their completion of the agreement can they apply for state unemployment?	
3	Can I terminate an employee who in the last 2.5 months has called off for family emergencies (2) illness or misc. (2) and no call-no showed on separate occasions (2-3)?	
4	I have an employee who is pregnant. She was on an assignment and was having complications with her pregnancy. During this time she was still on assignment as a caregiver. The result of that is that the client's family observed that she was not fulfilling her job duties as a caregiver, so they requested her to be removed and replaced. She is applying for unemployment. What should we provide to the state unemployment regarding her termination?	
3	A small group with 22 employees has an employee they are thinking of letting go. The employee has been talking about going out for surgery for a long time. If it is unrelated -? Should the employer wait until after the surgery, does that minimize risk?	
6	Deborah Muroz; dmoroz@decurion.com; 310-855-8257; Sr Dir HR An employee provided us with 72 hours advanced notice of resignation. We did not have his paycheck to him on time. Do we pay him one day's pay for each day that his paycheck was late?	
6	Deceased employee, if we have their final paycheck and it's in the form of a direct deposit how do we proceed?	
1	Less than a year ago, we have hired an employee and put them on salary in hopes of them transitioning into a managers role. Currently their job title is "Manager in Training" . This individual will never have the skills to become a manager and we need to change their status from salary to hourly. How Texas Workforce look at this? In addition, we are moving into our slow season and all hourly employees are not guaranteed 40 hours per week given. How does this affect unemployment and Texas workforce if a person on Salary is moved to hourly and not guaranteed a 40 hour work week?	
5	Montana Manager injured at work. He's on FMLA and will not be able to return when his FMLA exhausts. He is a GM at our only restaurant and we need to replace him.	
5	We hired an exempt employee and since last week he has been taking time to attend dental appointments, pick up prescriptions which we okay with minimal notice but he has failed to show up on time (about 6 hours late) to construction sites which he's required to supervise. The executives want to terminate right away. What are your thoughts?	
1	We have an employee who has been with us about a year. They have not been a great employee, they have been making a number mistakes. We want to make sure that we are okay in terminating the employee.	
1	We have to lay off 10 people. What is the best way to do it? Is it best to put everyone in one room or do one-on-one.	
3	A male employee was recently terminated due to inappropriate language used around other employees. This is regarding a 52 y.o. male employee who made sexually charged comments to a 16 y.o. female employee. Per our company policy, and as a result of our investigation, the male employee was terminated. The sheriff's office just called me asking why we terminated the employee. I did not disclose why I only confirmed that the male employee is no longer employed by our company. Must I share more information?	
4	Our employee informed us that she will not be returning to work. We normally pay holiday pay for Thanksgiving November 23rd, she was a no show no call on Friday 24th. Her last day worked was 11/21 and notified us on Monday 11/27 that she was not returning. Do I need to pay her Holiday pay on her final check?	
2	What does Wrongful termination mean? How does that work in conjunction with California being an At-Will-Employment state?	
1	We have an employee who has been on workers' compensation for several months and is not ready to return to work but we had to fill his position. What are the risks we terminate the employee now?	
6	I have a question about separations in california. I know the final pay laws are very strict and require an employee to be paid on their last day. We have an employee who recently submitted a resignation letter indicating the 8th as his final day, but he is scheduled for Vacation 12/2-12/9. If 12/1 is his last physical day worked is that considered his last day, or can an employee use PTO up to their last day thus meaning he could be paid on the 8th?	
1	We are a seasonal business and we are slowing down for the season, so there is no work available. Can we do a temporary layoff for one of our hourly employees? Will she qualify for unemployment benefits? We expect the layoff to be Dec - Feb. This person currently works an additional job at McDonald's - how will this impact her unemployment? NJ based employee and employer.	
1	Layoffs. Warehousing part of our business in Iowa. We have one location with long established client and about 100 employees. It runs independently, but under the same management umbrella as a smaller facility that we recently added to serve a different customer. This facility has 12 people and is managed by corporate. We are separating from the smaller customer and have to figure out what to do with the employees. Six of the employees have been offered jobs with customer. Four are transitioning to the larger warehouse. And a couple people will be displaced due to not being high performers. One is 55 and the other is 65, although age is not a reason for not moving them. We were told when we hired them they were not stellar performers, but we couldn't find anyone else at the time. Nothing is on file for performance. But it has been confirmed by their managers that they are not higher performers. How do I tell them, they are not moving over? There are more than enough positions in the large warehouse that we still need to fill.	
4	It's regarding drug use in the workplace in AZ. We have an employee we would like to terminate. She stated she wasn't feeling well and took some time to walk around the building and outside. She was eventually found outside passed out on the group; the paramedics were called. We were told by an employee that she had overdosed. The employee returned to work on her next scheduled day without giving any explanation as to what happened. We would like to terminate at-will. What are your thoughts?	
3	We have an employee whose last day is tomorrow. They have taken out more of their HSA than they have paid in. What rights does an employer have to request that back? Can it be taken out of a final paycheck? What other items are required on the last day of employment?	
5	We had an employee do a very egregious act. He has not given him warning in the past. Do we give him a document that here is what happened and I said generally no because you have warned them in the past. He has a termination slip that is a real simple form. Do we need to provide a detail reason for termination?	
5	An employee has been missing work due to a heart attack. HR and his manager tried to reach and he has been keeping in touch with one of our recruiters. The manager wants to terminate him right while he is in the hospital - I recommended we wait until he returns, to be empathetic and to minimize risk. The manager's manager is pushing me saying the employee is bad news and they want to terminate. Should I wait for him to come back? He has not brought in a note yet. He has been with the company under 3 weeks. No is doubting he did, he shared other medical history. He is over 40 and in other protected classes. We do not do PIPs in the 90 days in the general. Should HR be working with him on SDI options.	
4	2 of 3 -employee who sent me and manager an email that she is looking for work in June and she will stay on and help train. Is it okay for us to ask her for a specific date?	
1	We have had two employees who we terminated receive unemployment benefits from the GA DOL and I need to know what to do to avoid this in the future.	
4	3 of 3 -We have a 90 day probation period. We have a new hire that has been here for 2 months. She is not working out. Skill set not up to par and she works remotely and logs in but saw on Facebook she was on boat with her boyfriend. I know we are probably not allowed to say what we saw on her Facebook.	
6	We have an employee whose last day is this Friday and he tells us today his laptop was stolen. Can we deduct the full amount from his final check?	
1	Do we have to allow an employee to work through their notice period?	
3	844-228-1442 CEO advised HRM that the company wants to terminate an employee because her English skills do not match up with the requirements of the job; all of the jobs the employer has require proficiency in English	
4	We had an employee who wasn't doing too well and it was documented. We let her go in an interesting way. We sat her down and gave her two months to train her replacement and search for a new job. She has just accepted an opportunity that is starting May 22nd. Is it in her interest to send in a resignation letter or should I send her a standard termination notice?	
1	Hello! We have an employee leaving and he has gone negative in his PTO. We have a policy in our handbook stating it must be paid back but have an outdated form that we want him to sign in his exit interview stating the same. Can you supply an updated one? We have locations in IA and MN. Thanks!	
5	We have an employee who was only working for us for a short time who at the end of February said he wasn't feeling well and wanted to take some time off. It has been 9 weeks and he has only worked three days total. We never received medical certification to support this time off. We need to replace his position. We contacted him and advised we would need to part ways but that he could apply again when he was able to work. What should we be aware of at this point?	
2	Can you elect to take 401k deduction from a severance check? (Issue 1 of 2)	
2	I have a termination to conduct today and I need to talk about how to handle a disgrutled employee. He may become angry, yelling and may even be violet. Maybe not towards me but to our property.	
3	An employee worked for us sporadically and maybe totaled 120 hours. They were working with another person getting paid cash under the table and all of a sudden applied for unemployment against us. I don't know what happened to them. I responded that they hadn't worked for us in a long time, was casual, and had another job. We told him the job ended in September. He had a primary job working for a construction company (the cash job).	
5	Hello We have a commercial driver who is currently suspended from driving for us since he was arrested by a CHP officer, while on duty at work, after the bus he was driving for us was involved in an accident with a parked car. There were no injuries in the accident, just damage to both vehicles. The suspension started yesterday while we await the outcome of the CHP report. Therefore we have not terminated him from our employ and have not issued a final check. The suspended driver has today telephoned our office and asked where his final check is. I replied that he was not officially terminated, suspended only and I would get back to him. In your opinion, should we give him his final check immediately? It is highly unlikely that we will employ the driver again due to the circumstances of the accident and the fact that he has only been in our employ 3 weeks.	
3	Client has an employee who worked on first of month and will have coverage through end of month. She will not work enough hours this month to cover the premium payments. They have terminated her. Is there a way the company can get paid by her?	
3	How long can an old employee of ours get paid for unemployment on our account? How does it affect us? Can we require a drug test while they are on it?	
5	Employee was upset that someone parked in his parking spot. It should be noted that we do not have assigned parking. He approached the other employee & slapped him while telling him to move his car. The slap was hard enough that the employee spilled his coffee all over himself & he left for the day. This incident was witnessed by other staff members. The manager has written him up for his behavior & had a conversation with him about; not touching co-workers, not having assigned parking, and talking with a manager first if he has issues. Is there another suggestion on how to handle this situation?	
5	I have an employee who had a seizure at work yesterday. We called ambulance and he was taken to the hospital. This is the 2nd time at work. Not a work comp issues. He is on medication. He was on STD for about 6 weeks in December and was released to come back to work. He came in today with a release form the emergency room and we sent him home saying he needed to go to his own doctor and have him release you. We run large machinery. He is a danger to himself and others. Can we release him form work?	
4	We had an employee walk off the job after admitting to stealing money and property from work. She never picked up her last paycheck. What is our obligation regarding her last paycheck?	
4	An employee left on Friday the 28th. Our petty cash is missing as well as a $100 gift card. She was the only one here, I think she made a copy of the key. I think she let herself in on Monday after hours. When I asked her on Wednesday (I left her a message) if she still had a key and asked if she had made a copy, she didn't answer the question and asked when she was going to get her final check. She started texting my new employee and questioning her. I have a call into the police to make a report. She is due one more check for a 40-hour workweek and she just got on our insurance in March. Benefit logic quoted her a cost for March and April $850 and she started freaking out - "what portion are you paying?" She has already used the insurance and the broker said we can't cancel. She thinks I am taking $300 out of her check. I feel that because she stole from me, can I take the full amount. Is there anything we can do to let future employers know?	
3	ADA - I have an EE who has been on LOA since 2/26/16. He is not terminated as the EE was hoping to return to work. It has come to my attention that the EE is on a transplant list & is not going to be able to return to work anytime soon. The EE is on COBRA & has been since 7/1/16 date. Can I terminate this EE & send a letter of confirmation of termination? Thanks	
4	I have an employee that has been with us 8 months. She has begun coming in late or calling out. She is an alcoholic and we knew this when she was rehired and she has sought treatment several times. When she came into our office she stated that her physician was looking for a treatment facility to place her, does this change whether we can terminate her? Does this now place her in a protected class where we need to utilize a leave of absence (she does not qualify for FMLA at this time).	
0	I have a Salaried employee who gave his resignation. He is leaving 4 days into the new pay period. Do I have to pay him a full pay period or just the 4 days due? Please advise. Thanks!	
5	I need guidance for an EE that has missed multiple days since his hire date on 02/24/2017. Soon after being hired EE claimed he was injured, but it was prior to working for us. He has now put in a WC claim, which my co-worker is addressing. He asked for time off on May 1st and May 5th and has not shown up May 8th -10th. Our policy is a 3 day no call , no show and voluntary resignation is accepted. However, I just found out that he called in about 11:30 am 5/9/17 which is 6 1/2 hours after his shift, he was at a meeting on 4/28/17 where we discussed, the importance of calling in prior to shift start times and calling in themselves, unless they were incapable to do it themselves. We have 2 separate Disciplinary action forms that we have been waiting to issue; however he has not been here. At this point I would be sending out a acceptance of voluntary resig. along with his final paycheck. Is there anything more I should do before I send out the paper work?	
5	We are in the construction business. We hired an employee on Jan 30th and he was terminated a couple of weeks ago. He contacted me and stated that he was laid off with no notice and he is entitled to severance because he is a veteran with special circumstances. He was laid off for his inability to do the job. He lives in New Jersey. We paid him for a full 40 hours even though he only worked 20. He told the owner that he was not paid the full amount of his wages. Are we required to provide severance pay?	
2	Termination of EE in the 3rd month of employment. No warnings, documentation of poor performance. Minority and over 40 years of age. The supervisor yells and cusses, but he does it to everyone. What would be the risk of letting the EE go?	
4	Had to terminate someone. She threw a curve ball during termination notification. In the meeting, she asked "can I resign instead". She is thinking about running for public office. Management is okay with her resigning and I just wanted to check if there was anything that could come back on us.	
6	We are terminating an employee today for attendance. Do we have to tell her the reason? Can we do the meeting over the phone? Can we mail her final paycheck?	
5	Employee hired at other location, performance issues, moved him to a different location. I have to keep retraining him and it is costly. He's just not picking up what we need him to. He doesn't have any industry experience. Client relations is the issue and it does not seem like a good fit.	
4	I have an employee that called out of work on Monday and has not shown up for work since. At this point her employment with us is over but what steps should we take as far as notifying her that by not reporting for work she has voluntarily vacated her position? We also want to make sure she will not be able to collect unemployment against our MA DUA account or get sued for wrongful termination.	
6	An employee has been off work for an extended period of time and has been let go due to health issues. The only final check I have to give him is 3 vacation days. He is missing some uniforms. Our policy is that you must pay for what is not turned. Can I take it out of the final check?	
6	If an employer continues benefits through the end of the month. If the employee provides their resignation, can you double the deduction from the final check?	
4	Issue with FT employee whose work has been average dealing with health and family issues in far excess of company policy. She is negative in all time off categories including paid sick leave with the exception of some vacation. We allow employees to work from home once per month and she is also negative under that policy. (The employer did accommodate a medically certified absence by providing five additional work from home days). Employer had a conversation with employee just last Friday to tell her she needed to be here and on time. Today she sent in a request to work from home which the employer denied and told her she can either take time off unpaid or vacation. The employer would like to terminate the employee.	
6	Employee was hired on 4.28 and was arrested in the office this morning. Money was missing from the office. police were doing an investigation and found that the employee had a warrant out for her arrest for identity theft. Employee was terminated due to security of client private information. When is final check due and what are the termination paperwork requirements?	
1	We have an employee who has been absent and we would like to let him go. He has had performance issues and we are thinking that might be an easier reason to let him go. We are concerned if we let him go for attendance, it will be retaliatory for being sick.	
0	Question from client: One of our employees in our Franklin, TN location is voluntarily leaving Phoenix Package. He still has 24 hours of PTO that has yet to be used. Employees acquire PTO based on their anniversary hire date as opposed to accrual period. Im a little confused as to what we are required to do as a private company. I know that TN law requires a payout upon employee leaving but I had seen your document attached stating that PTO must be paid upon separation if the employers policy or labor contract provides for payout. Would the state law override that? For this employee Derrick Johnson who will be leaving with 24 hours of PTO, are we required to pay him for those hours?	
3	Can you fire an employee for performance issues, if they are currently in receipt of workers' compensation benefits?	
2	We will be terminating an employee. He is already aware of it. I would like to run some comments on the termination letter by you.	
1	Payroll deductions question. An employee terminated on 5/3 and we gave her a paycheck, but we think the PTO may not have been included. They have benefits through the end of May. We know we need to pay her the PTO, and we wanted to confirm the waiting time penalty. Can we take a second deduction for benefit premiums on the PTO check? When an employee provides a two week notice of termination effective 5/3, and then doesn't show up for work after 4/29, can we change their termination date back to the last day worked? We would rather they are not covered on benefits through May.	
6	Hello! If our offer letters, we state that if an employee resigns or is terminated within 90 days, your final pay check could be subjective to administrative cost. This cost will be deducted from your final check. Can we deduct this type of fee from someone's paycheck? If so, is it suppose to be a certain amount? Any help is greatly appreciated.	
4	We have a substitute teacher. Should we stop scheduling her to work or should we terminate her? Can she file for unemployment?	
1	I am looking for advise on how to write a new policy/procedure for our company. We work Industrial Construction all across the nation. Many of our direct labor field crew, are only used as we have work and laid off until we have another job for them. I need to clearly define when an employee is considered a re-hire and when they have been gone long enough to be considered a new hire?	
1	We will be eliminating 2 long-term positions. Our business has declined and we just don't have the need for the positions any longer. We will not be back-filling. We're planning on offering severance of 2 weeks per year of work. They are both over the age of 40.	
3	When an employee quits looking for a form that states that they quit on their own accord and have them sign and date.	
5	This is a follow up to a previous issue. We had a meeting with the employee and he has decided to resign in order to get himself together. I just wanted to present him with a simple separation agreement stating that he resigned his position and that he would be eligible for rehire. Do you have a sample document in this regard?	
5	We let go a commissioned sales person. We'd been talking to him for some time about him not meeting his goals, but the termination still came a big surprise to him. He's making a number of demands of us. He wants to the following in writing: promise that unemployment will be paid out promise that our non-compete will be voided that commissions will continue to be paid on any deals beyond his termination date that we will provide a positive reference and further not disclose that he was terminated.

6	Wanted to confirm that the final pay for an employee who we are terminating in California (consisting primarily of their PTO payout), can be sent to the remote employee on the day they are terminated.	
5	We have an employee that is currently being treated for a work related injury. He put in his two week notice and tomorrow was going to be his last day, but he had an MRI today and was told that he has additional restrictions that will prevent him from working the new job that he accepted. He asked if he could cancel his two week notice because he wants to stay employed with us now. We have more employees right now than what we will need in the near future and he will not be able to continue to do his regular job due to the restrictions. Is it okay to decline his request to cancel his two week notice and let him know that tomorrow is his last day?	
4	Client: Has several properties. An employee has been out due to stroke but she has not responded to us at all regarding her condition or RTW status. We have heard through others she is in the hospital recuperating and does not intend to return to work. However, she nor family members have returned our calls. The employee has been out several months and the employer needs to fill the position. What should they do before separating the individual? Employee is not eligible for FMLA.	
0	Hi, If we need to mail out the payment for PTO does it need to be sent out the night before so that it is delivered on the day of termination or can we mail it out to the employee that day so it is post marked the date of termination?	
4	We hired a nurse and she is not up to date on her documentation. We have to document within 24 hours. Approximately 6 months ago we decided terming her would put us at more risk because she did not complete documentation. We kept her to catch up on her documentation and that the end of December would be the end of her work. I told her that 1/1/18 would be her final day. She then said she wanted to work until August and we said no so she said she would go on unemployment. Can you send anything on New York unemployment that I could review in regards to this? How long can someone claim benefits for? Can they receive benefits if terminated for poor performance?	
0	Does the state of Arkansas have any wage or other laws that require that accrued vacation be paid following voluntary or involuntary termination of employment? We are creating an employee handbook and are unsure how to handle this. But to maintain at-will employment, we cannot base paying out vacation time on whether or not an employee gives 2 weeks notice or not. Correct?	
3	Hi there! How are severance payouts taxed? Are they taxed like bonuses, at a higher rate? Lower rate? This would be for employees both in CA and NY. Thanks!	
2	I have a question about a termination review	
5	It's regarding a possible termination. Concerned about a situation that happened. They are a protected class. African-American, homosexual male with possible mental problems so ADA. Employee has had write ups and was on track for termination - absenteeism, leaving shift without saying anything. On Monday his boyfriend (who also works here) and him came here super early, went into the bathroom, came out and then he called the manager and they left because employee tried to harm himself. They came back the next day and left again to check him into rehab. Can we terminate for leaving in the middle of the shift? I am nervous about moving forward with termination.He is eligible for FMLA. I don't know if we want him back as an employee. I gave him a two day suspension and he cannot come back to work on Monday, with possible termination. He told me has an appointment with a psychiatrist in January and he asked for FMLA paperwork. He wants to return to work until he sees the psychiatrist. What is the FMLA definition of spouse? They both asked for FMLA. I think they're only engaged.

4	California restaurant: Associate GM, Stacy on a final warning for conduct; Server, Sarah, is also on a final warning for conduct; has anxiety so GM put her on less stressful shifts. Around 11.10 Stacy and Sarah had conflict in the workplace one day and Sarah claimed the AGM harassed her. Conflict was corroborated but no harassment found however both acted out and yelled in front of customers. Thanksgiving Day shift Associate GM gave instruction to three servers (including Sarah) and Sarah said she felt singled out and left early for the day which the AGM allowed her to do. HRM concerned about Sarah's anxiety condition (HRM later requested medical certification after GM accommodated without question); AGM and server's conduct in front of guests and harassment, even though no harassment found in investigation of Sarah's complaint.

1	We have a part-time at will employee who works two days a week. We are considering terminating employment. Does the law require that in Michigan we give the employee a filled out UA 1711. If a severance is given does it need to be separate from the check written for the pay period? Is there a penalty if we don't give the UA 1711 form? What other forms should be given to the employee? I am confused by what I read last night on ThinkHR. If the employee is terminated it will be today. Please respond to me, if possible, within the next half hour. Thank you so much, Deborah	
4	We have an employee who was on a medical leave before thanksgiving for 10 days. This is a ADA reasonable accommodation type of leave. We have sent the forms to her doctor, and they have not sent anything back to us. We have a history with this employee in the past, and she's filed WC claims.

She then had a no-call/no-show, a shift where she advised she would be late but never arrived, another no-call/no-show, and another call out. The employer now wants to terminate based on attendance.

5	One Supervisor in the Warehouse feels sick with a terrible allergy (He suffers from this and takes medication). He leaves one hour before the closing for the day (Supervisor A). He was responsible for all the equipment in the warehouse (some of the equipment very expensive and valuable). He leaves in charge to his partner, another Supervisor (B) and ask him to make sure all the equipment was completed at the end of the day. The next day, when the Manager arrives and check the equipment, one $10,000 USD equipment is missing and neither of the two supervisors know where the equipment was. Employee (Supervisor A) who left one day before sick is fired by his Manager for low performance. He called me (HR) and told me he got fired because of the missing equipment even though he left his partner in charge and his partner only got suspension. Direction in HR has decided both should be treated equally and the Supervisor B will be terminated as well. Both terminations are based on poor performance.

3	If an employee is separated prior to the voluntary resignation date is the separation still considered voluntary? (Because the employer no longer wants the the employee at the workplace.)

As far of the annual review, I do not know why there was not one done for her, but I know before she resigned the supervisor was working on one for her but it was never completed. She had not been performing and we had documented issues in her performance prior to her resigning.	
0	We are located in Florida. Several of our local clients who have PTO prefer to do a USE IT OR LOSE IT policy at the end of their employee's benefit year (including not paying out PTO at time of term). Based on our research and a discussion with employment lawyers, Florida employers are not required to provide vacation time to their employees; however, once vacation is offered, verbally or in writing, it is included in the definition of wages. This is based on Ferry v XRG Int Fl Statutue 443.036 and 1217. As I look more into this, it isn't actually a Fl Statute that requires an employer to pay out PTO at termination or end of benefit year if no roll-over is allowed, it is more an implication based off Case Law and what is considered "Wages" Most of these employees do have handbooks that outline the Use it or lose it policy. Please advise.

0	An employer (ER) provides vacation time to employees (EE) on an accrual basis. The handbook clearly states that upon termination of employment (for any reason) if more vacation time has been used than accrued, it will be deducted from the EE final paycheck. However, the handbook does not state how accrued and unused vacation time will be handled upon termination of employment. But, the ER practice is to never pay out any unused vacation time. Are there any issues with this practice?	
4	We have a staff member who broke a few policies and laws. We found out the employee was forging parent signatures and charging for therapy times to the insurance company, and was getting paid for work that had not been done. We discovered this when parents were inquiring about missed appointments. The employee was initially not forthcoming, but when we stated that we needed to have the parents verify the documents to reconcile the missed appointments, she confessed to forging the signatures and defrauding the insurance company and reporting time worked that she did not work. I am inclined to terminate, but there are others here who want to give her a second chance.

5	Received question from client: So we have an employee who was a bit disgruntled and he resigned. He resigned effective 2/20/17 and then asked how many days of PTO he had and could he use those up. I told him he had to coordinate with his manager and his client and that he could not use the 20th as his last day because to get the holiday he has to work before and after the holiday. He then emailed his customer this morning and said he is considering his last day on site to be today and is using his AFC PTO. The customer thought we had okd this but we had not but they want him gone COB today. Can we technically use today as his last day when I send him his out processing letter even though he wanted to use his PTO? We are paying him for his PTO in his final paycheck but he wont accrue anymore PTO for the pay period. Just was hoping you might have some advice on this.

5	Dear Think HR, We will separate from an Arizona employee, who works in both Arizona, California and Europe. Our head office is in California. I have a couple of questions: 1. Does he need to get his final paycheck on his last day of work day according to CA laws? 2. If we write a termination agreement/severance agreement to pay him for an extra month, and he signs it, when do we need to pay him for the extra month? (We will cut off his network access on the last day of work). 3. Are we allowed to wire all the money we owe him, instead of giving him a check on his last day, if he will be terminated in Europe, and there is not enough time to FedEx the check? Many thanks!

1	We have an employee in California who we anticipate will be announcing her resignation this week. We are in the process of determining increases and bonuses but our practice is not to announce those till the end of February. Bonuses would then be paid out in March. Increases would become effective at the end of February but are retroactive back to January 1st. Are we required to pay out the bonus if she leaves before we announce it? What if we announce it but she leaves prior to the payout date? Are we required to provide the retroactive increase if she leaves before we announce it? What if we announce it but she leaves prior to the payroll that it is due to be paid out on?

5	We have an employee that we terminated on Friday. His last day worked was 1/25, we dated the check on Friday, 2/10 and had it ready for him with our regular payroll. He didn't come pick it up so on Saturday we put it in the mail, as is our standard practice. Today he called and asked about his check. We told him we mailed it on Saturday to the address on file. he said he doesn't live there anymore and wants us to place a stop payment and send a new check to him out of state. What is out obligation to do so? We want to wait until the check is returned to us, then we will reissue the check.	
1	We have had an incident today at work, where one of the employees had an accident with one of the machines in the bakery department. Apparently the assistant manager was distracted talking to someone else, and turned on the machine while the employee hand was still inside. That caused the accident, and now the employee is injured. Would we be able to terminate the assistant manager for negligence or any other reason?

5	With multiple callers at client Cell-Crete: We found out some unfavorable things about a guy's record and it could jeopardize his credentials. We're within our 90 days. How do we let him go without any repercussions due to the fact his resume his illegitimate. We found out that he was in prison for a period of time he claims he was working for a company that went out of business. Based on what a consultant is telling us, we're putting yourself out there for damages because he did some illegal things. We hired him to do safety and he was found guilty of fraud and convicted by the FBI for falsifying asbetos training and taking the money. Time served 2011, 2009 conviction. The employee is in California. Can we just go with 90 days?	
4	Employee claims money was stolen from her purse. Cameras showed evidence that shows someone stole from the area where the employee said her purse was. The person looked around, then reached into the locker and stuffed something down their pants. Is this enough proof or do we need to have captured the money/purse with our cameras? Can we terminate based on this?	
5	Client question: I have a situation here at the office that has to do with wearing a respirator. It is required if you work on the floor as a Composite tool technician that you must wear a respirator for certain jobs. This is made clear to employee prior to being hired that they will have to wear a respirator to perform certain jobs. (it is not notated on the job description) I have an employee that was out of work yesterday and he told us that he had a bad asthma attack and that he hasni12t had one in 2 years. He cannot wear a respirator having asthma. My question, can we let him go since we didni12t know that he had asthma and cannot perform the duties required of the position?

3	Unemployment Claim Protest Good afternoon, A previous employee has filed for unemployment benefits (the attached claim was received on 12/01/2017). We would like to protest her claim and were hoping you could walk us through it. In summary, there was quite a bit of back and forth with this employee back in July of this year. Without getting into all the details, she stopped coming into work, provided no proof of medical reason to be out of the office (and we addressed her concern), and has now filed for unemployment benefits. We would like to protest her claim under the following note attachment at the bottom of page 1: "A quit, discharge, suspension, leave of absence, job refusal, labor dispute....are some reasons to file a protest." We must issue this protest by December 11, 2017, and I was planning on submitting via the online link they provide. I have never filed a protest like this and want to be sure I take the appropriate steps. Could you please advise? Thank you!

1	Employee resigned and gave two weeks notice. We walked her out. Do we have to pay the two weeks pay and cover the health insurance?	
4	Employee's performance, we are inclined to separate. Right now she is the Administrative Services Manager, an employee below her has resigned and she failed to plan for the worker's replacement because it was her intention to retain the worker, while management had a candidate in mind for the replacement. We have since hired another worker and advised the current employee of a job scope change, but the company is no longer inclined to retain her and would like to separate her.	
3	Follow up to previous question, if the employee is here past his probationary period are we still okay to terminate his employment. Is the employment still at-will? The employee is in California.	
3	A client has an employee who has not shown up for work for the last 5 days. This employee has been terminated for excessive absences however they have a key to the facility. Can the employer withhold pay for hours worked until they get their property back? Can they change the former employees Direct deposit to check in order get the former employee to come to the location? Other than calling a locksmith, what can they do?	
5	We terminated an employee, via certified mail, who has been off due to illness for the past 3 months after he failed to produce physician's statements which provided a path for him to return to work. This employee began sending threatening texts upon receipt of the letter. The texts have been sent to our owner and another manager. Today, he called the office and was screaming threats to the office manager. Some threats are just things he says he's going to do to blacklist our company to our customers. The one text to our owner said that he was going to 'mess him up' because he had messed with the wrong person. What are our legal ramifications for these continued, harassing texts and threats?	
2	Eeloria, Thank you for your help. Is there a template that includes the required language? Language in the severance agreement must identify the employees rights under both the OWBPA and the ADEA.	
2	Do you have a severance agreement template? Does it include cyber security? We are going to terminate employment at 4:30 today.	
2	Upon termination we give employee required EDD form on Unemployment. However, the form we give is DE 2320M and is two pages. I recently came across another form DE2320 which is 27 pages. Which is the right form we are required to give a terminated employee?	
5	We have an individual that has applied for an intern journeymen position and he has been here for a year. We needed to ensure him for driving. We took a chance because he had too many infractions knowing that if there was another infraction that we would have to pay as our insurance carrier would not cover him. He has demonstrated some behaviors that are concerning. He is learning how to open his own farm. We are not going to be hiring him on at the end of the internship. The interns live here and has partied heavily and there have been complaints and he has been driving too fast and we have children on the premises. If he asks directly the reason that we will not be hiring him on what should we say?	
5	Brett @ The Body Shop brett@bodyshopinc.com 805-584-2851 Employee came in before Thanksgiving with a broker arm, stating that he had broken his arm outside of work. He had a note stating he would need to be off of work for 2-days. We have not heard from him since. How should we proceed?	
1	Employee has been with the company for awhile and we are relocating to another place. Her performance is not up to standard and wondering if we can use this move to make a termination?	
2	What are the rules to laying off an employee in California?

5	We have an employee who told us he needed to take time off due to an upcoming surgery and gave us a specific date for his surgery. As of now, he has yet to have the surgery and we do not have any medical documentation substantiating his time off. We would like to terminate the employee.	
2	in the middle of a termination , the employee states that its age discrimination -- what to do next?	
6	We have something in writing but it is not airtight. It is written by the mother of the employee "I authorize future payments that are due to him to be given to his brother" and lists his name. It is signed by her and the brother and dated, not by the employee. Can I accept this? We have not received information from the employee himself that corroborates the claims. We'll wait for the pay period to end (today) and issue the final check with normal payroll. Can I reach out the brother to see if I can get something?	
5	I just had an employee come in and open up my business and when the second employee came in he walked out. When my manager called him he stated that he quit and he was done. He has to clean the locker rooms and make sure towels are being run and dried and our laundry was a mess and we had to bring in additional payroll to fix what he did not do. He worked from 5 am to 8 am and then left. He stated that he expected his full check on Friday. Am I allowed to deduct form damages his final pay?	
3	An employee accidentally took a drink from another employees drink and tasted alcohol in it. The employee asked the other employee if there was alcohol in there and the employee admitted to it. This information was not brought to the attention of management immediately so no reasonable suspicion procedure was conducted. Since a manager or supervisor did not witness this event, our only option is to discuss what was brought to our attention to get his side of the story and monitor him. If the employee actually admitted to drinking on the job, would we be safe terminating the employee?	
5	We let an employee go on Friday in California and we did not tell him much and they told them to call me if he has any questions. If he calls and asks me the reason for his termination should I provide him with more information?	
1	from VM: Please call me back to discuss an HR issue. 303-960-7951. We terminated an employee and we did not know we would be terminating the employee. Are we required to pay them right away? Is there any leeway when the circumstances are unforeseen.	
3	I am working on a separation agreement for an employee and working from a template we used for someone else. That person was over 40 so we included a section about the ADA in it. Can I completely remove that section of this agreement since this person is under 40? If so, how many days do I need to give him to review and sign the document? Also, there's a section that discusses "Governing Law; Forum for Resolution of Disputes; Jury Trial Waiver. " The state the document references is Maryland because that is where our company is located and operates however this person lives in RI Is it still appropriate to use MD in this section? Thanks.	
5	We had an employee on Friday who came out and said to another employee that he is done and he has a gun at home and he wants to kill people. We called the police. Hired additional security and will file for a restraining order. Planning on terminating the employee tomorrow at the police station. I want to make sure I'm not forgetting anything and would like to discuss. I have never dealt with something like this. He was taken on a 5150, but was out within a couple of hours. He says he gave up all his firearms willing to the police. I will be doing the termination with the police and the safety manager. I have statements from the foreman and the apprentice.	
3	Can an employee be fired for insubordination in front of other employees and staff?	
3	We are a private school where our teachers have contracts that typically run from 8/1 - 7/31 each school year. The last day of school is in mid-May and teaching staff are required to report for a week or so after the last day to finalize grades and finish any other tasks before the start of their summer break. Typically teaching staff do not report to the school during June or July. In the case where we have a teacher who does not renew their contract we are obligated to pay them the salary that is owed for June and July as we annualize their contract salary, but what date should be their effective termination date? In the past the last working day was 7/31 even though they may not have reported to the school since May. The termination date affects their insurance benefits if paid by the school and COBRA benefits. Is there any guidance as to how we should handle the termination date?	
4	We have a full time exempt salaried nurse that has not come to work in a week. We are going to terminate her employment. We paid for some schooling on her behalf and are wanting to know if we can with hold the cost of the schooling from her last check? She is aware that she is supposed to pay us back. It is in our employee handbook as the following "If your employment terminates, whether voluntarily or involuntarily within twelve months of the company paying a fee on your behalf, (i.e., classes, seminars, exams, license, etc) the entire cost will be withheld from your pay check and/or expense reimbursement check. We have a signed handbook receipt from her. She has a final pay check coming along with a check for any unused vacation time.	
0	An employee terminated on November 1. In error, the managers at that location did not process the termination on time, and the employee was paid out vacation time for a vacation that she had previously requested. Would that alter her termination date?	
1	We have a facility in KY which we are shutting down on 12/15. One of out employees is on a non-FMLA medical leave. We do not want to give this employee severance as he has not been working and we are requiring employees to work until the 15th to receive severance. We would however like to provide him with the annual bonus we are paying out to all employees. We are not working with legal counsel through this situation. We have talked to the state and they said we did not have to provide WARN notices because we have less than 50 employee's at this site. We have 33 total.	
0	Can you tell me if vacation pay is paid out at time of termination? A client has an employee who has not been there a year and wonders if vacation needs to be paid out.	
5	I had an employee who turned in his resignation on November 10th with two weeks notice which would have been the 24th. We chose to make November 22nd his final day, as we were closed on the 23rd and 24th for the Thanksgiving holiday. The individual is stating he should have been paid for the holiday.	
5	I have a key employee that his performance hasn't been up to my expectations. He has been with the company for around 10 years. He left us for 6-9 months and then came back - that was about 3-4 years ago. He is black. He can be difficult to confront. I think letting him go will be difficult. There are no write-ups in his file as of today, but I have meant to put some things in there with regard to his recent decline in performance. How can I let him go and not have any repercussions?	
4	I have a manager who is colluding with one of my customers to open another salon and go there. She is trying to solicit my other stylists and is telling all of the customers. I made her sign an employment contract to stay here for a year by raising her pay and had her sign it yesterday. The contract indicates that she can not solicit clients for any other salons within a certain radius of this salon. It also states I can terminate for cause. However, I found out yesterday she has asked other stylists to come with her when she leaves. What would be the most appropriate course of action.	
5	CO-we hired someone 11-days ago. A week ago, the employee told us that he does not do well with others and that he had PTSD. He handed the manager, 1-page of a 11-page report from 2015-2016 report can't work with other's can't be managed by anyone can't drive a car because of the medication he is on Report from doctor further states that the employee has violent tendencies and suicidal thoughts. He provided the above information and told his supervisor that he would need to go home because someone had upset him. When he first brought the PTSD to our attention we attempt to provide him with simple tasks but in light of the items above we cannot accommodate a porter who cannot work with other employees, be supervisors or drive a car because of the medication he is on. He was hired as a porter, and these are the essential functions of his position.

5	The supervisor has no management experience and decided he wanted to get rid of an employee and went to work in making the employee's life truly miserable. The employee then chose to resign and had a conversation with the supervisor's supervisor and it was a good conversation. What should he put in his resignation letter so he can get unemployment?	
4	We have a teacher who was going to be spoken to regarding walking off the job. When we spoke with her she started getting upset and complained her manager was harassing her.

2	California employee over 40 who has been on a PIP and not making required changes to successfully perform the job. Is there anything special I need to do before I terminate?	
5	We just gave notice to an employee that we would be terminating his employment in 30-days. He's stating that he would like to resign instead. Are we okay to allow that? He's already sent over a resignation letter.	
2	Hi - I am trying to find guidance regarding the Notice to Employee As To Change in Relationship (issued in pursuant to provisions of Section of the Unemployment Insurance Code). Is this required to be distributed to employees at time of termination, separation, or when going on leave? If so, does it have to be its own document, or can this be rolled into a termination/leave letter? Thank you for your insight.	
1	We have a group of employees who we are laying off and we will be including an employee whose position we will be needing. We have decided to include this employee in the reduction in workforce because we previously had this employee on a write-up for performance and their performance improved. We do not think this will last, so we want to include them in this lay off as opposed to dealing with a termination at a later date. Is there going to be an issue with laying off this employee and then opening up their position soon for other candidates. I'd also like assistance going through the script for the lay-off.

6	Hi There, We have an employee in California whose last day of work is on 12/18/17. We actually have a pay date on 12/15/17 and were wondering if we can include her final pay up to an including the 18th as well as all of her PTO payout and owed wages on the 15th check date.

4	An employee has been dishonest on her timecard, I have spoken to her about it and she has continued to enter incorrect "in" times. She has also called off frequently, during our most busy time of year, for non-medical related reasons. I would like to terminate her, but after the holidays. Can we discuss? Another HR person I know will advise the EE that "things are just not working out, I recommend you start looking for other employment." Thoughts?	
3	We have a group in Arizona who had an employee terminate employee on Friday 12/1 (12/1 was the last day worked). Their medical policy is set up that coverage goes through the end of the month, therefore this employee has medical coverage through 12/31. The terminated employee will be receiving their final paycheck this Friday. Is the group able to deduct medical contributions for the entire month of December, or only through the period in which the employee is being paid (thru 12/1)?

The manager would like to eliminate this position however the he will probably replace the position with someone at a lower salary. What are the consideration? Offering severance/cobra if he decides to leave.	
2	Hi, To clarify, a termination letter if it contains all the elements would suffice? Thank you, Laico Cook, Sr. Benefits Specialist Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. 12780 El Camino Real, San Diego, CA 92130 Ph: 858-617-7749 lcook@neurocrine.com Delivering on Hope	
4	Our consultant just received her unemployment papers from where she was laid off. What are the rules for when she earns a limited amount of money or is there a maximum amount of money she can earn and still qualify for unemployment.	
6	We are terminating an employee in Texas and understand the final pay requirements. However, we would like to continue their pay until the end of the month. What are our options?	
5	Hi! I got the below email from a client- is there any specific language/info you can provide me with to pass along to her about holding the employee responsible for his healthcare premiums for the remainder of the month? They are paid weekly. Thanks! Good morning, Ellen. I have a question I was hoping you could help me with. We had an employee turn in his 1 week notice today. He walked off of the job this afternoon when we told him that he would be responsible for paying for his health insurance for the rest of the month. If we cannot cancel it effective 12.6.17, does his enrollment paperwork for 2017 specifically speak to this issue? We have made it clear for 2018, but we did not make it verbally clear last year. Thanks for your help.	
3	We terminated an employee yesterday and just want to confirm there is no separation letter which needs to be provided to the employee.	
1	We're considering rescinding a job offer that was already accepted by the candidate. Is there risk in doing so? His background check came back fine but we have learned from someone internally that this individual has dealt with lots of personal issues in the past which concern us.	
6	We had an employee whose last day was Friday. We were trying to get the check there on Thursday, but there were issues with the delivery. We met with the employee yesterday, and paid the additional two days of waiting time, however, that check has now been delayed. Is there an added penalty for the late penalty check?	
3	I have a question for a client in Arkansas. This client lays off all teachers from May to Aug when school is out then rehires for the next school year. They may not be tenured yet. Are they violating an laws by doing this. Any documents we you can provide them to help prevent a lawsuit. This is a headstart program.	
4	We hired a sales support person about 3 weeks ago. She and her outside sales person have a very strained relationship, the employee is making mistakes and although she has been trained, she is not retaining the information she was taught. She is coming in to the office, but not really supporting her person, because the sales person cannot trust her work. In addition, we have all smelled alcohol on her breath, and when questioned, she said it was from an energy drink she uses. We do not have a reasonable suspicion testing policy. We would like to terminate her. Can we discuss?	
1	We had to terminate an employee effective December 6 but have agreed to pay through the end of December. Our thought was to continue to pay her through the end of the month. Could we do this in this schedule?	
1	If somebody is retiring what are we required to have ready from an HR standpoint? Is the separation paperwork the same? Do we have to pay out stand alone sick leave?	
5	Good evening, Can you please provide guidance on the following question/information? Also, attached are supporting documents. The group is in PA and has less than 20 EEs. Our employee Jason Lipschultz has violated about 6 things in his contract and has done so for the last 9 months. Many conversations have taken place with Carranza and Jason. Jason just refuses to comply. In October we had a meeting and put everything in a meeting format and had him sign it after the meeting and fully reading it. He still will not comply. We have not done any formal write ups this year as of yet. Write ups don't move him at all. Just a FYI Jason has been fired 3 other times but brought back based on his promises to abide by his contract. Thank you for your assistance. Best regards, Lisa L. Reed Senior Account Manager	
0	After a layoff how long should companies allow for call backs? We have multiple states....IL, CO, FL, NJ, IN, GA, WI, MI, TX, TN, AZ. During layoffs is it normal to pay our employee vacation time or should we keep the time earned to their return? We have Multiple States being effected....IL, CO, FL, NJ, IN, GA, WI, MI, TX, TN, AZ. Are we supposed to be paying out vacation. and if we want rehire for the laid off positions what time do we wait?	
4	I have had an employee who has been out for various reasons. We wrote her up in October and gave her final warning stating that her next absence without having any time available would mean termination. She is out again and has provided a doctor's note that she has strep throat. She has no time available (vacation or sick). Would this be considered the final absence if she has a note?	
2	Please send the CA Termination Documents.	
1	Follow up regarding an employee who is on a PIP. The employee has still been out and has not reported back to work. How can we proceed? Can we go ahead and terminate? Do we have to offer a severance? Can we terminate over the phone? What about final pay?	
2	Would you send me documents which need to be provided to terminated employees in California?	
1	We have one employee who is based on Pennsylvania. I believe he will be leave soon. What are required to provide per the state of Pennsylvania?	
6	An employee quit and Friday will be her last day. Do we have we have to final pay if they quit?	
4	One of my employees put in her two weeks on Monday. At this point she is not being productive at all. If I let her go early, would it be a termination.	
5	An employee has been on personal leave since August. We understand he may have another job and is not planning on returning to work, but we have nothing documented. How long must we keep him on benefits? We sent him a letter on Nov 13 notifying him that we will terminate his health benefits if he does not pay his portion of the premiums. We have not heard back. Can we terminate his employment?

2	Question #1 of 2: We are based in NY but a Chicago employee put in her letter of resignation. This is my first Illinois employee resignation; is there specific documentation required?	
3	We hired a couple employees as seasonal on call. Neither has worked for a few months. One moved away and the supervisor says they are no longer needed. How do I code it, its not a termination. Separation on change in relationship?	
2	Do you have a sample letter notifying someone they are being laid off/terminated?	
1	We have employees working at client sites. We do not keep employees on the bench while we look for other assignments. I have a client who has asked us to remove an employee from their assignment. They received complaints from 2 employees over our employee arranging himself in front of them. I made them feel very uncomfortable. Their HR relayed to me that his actions are not conducive to their culture or work environment. How can I communicate the termination to him assuming he will ask the reason?	
5	Via vmail. Company name: Urus. Callback Kevin 617-680-8589 We are considering a termination of an employee who has called out sick a lot. We have 6 days sick per year under Massachusetts law. He is part time. We seems to be calling out a lot. Used all his sick time already. We have 5 employees. We talked to him about the sick time he can use but he has been taking more time off than he has available. 15	
4	Employee provided written letter of resignation indicating her last day worked, and stated that the days beyond that day she would like to use as paid vacation. Manager discussed company policy stating that paid vacation may not occur after last day of employment. In meantime, manager hired a replacement employee. Employee then stated she changed her mind, she would like to extend her resignation and take her vacation now and return part time. I just want to confirm that we are not obligated to accept her modified resignation notice, correct?	
4	We have an employee who we terminated and sent her termination letter but it was returned. It was sent certified but it was returned. Should I do anything else? She is very hostile and do not want to call her to see if her address has changed.	
2	I want best practices for terminating an employee that may solicit an emotionally aggressive responsive. Can you cover ideas for termination and handling the termination meeting?	
3	We have a client whose employee passed away yesterday. The employee has worked there for many years. In addition to the life insurance, they would like to keep contribute to the 401 (k) and provide some additional compensation for a short period of time. What are the ramifications? They are setting a precedent.	
3	Employee status change; highly paid employee who is going to be resigning by mutual agreement. He will take all of his PTO, then work part-time regular employee then employee will be terminated on October 12th.	
5	An employee has been with us for about a year. During the last 6 months, we have been trying to work with him, but he has several company policy violations. He was driving a company truck without a valid DL and had an accident, he failed a drug test, he does not clock in and out as required, he comes to work and leaves when he wants, he claimed hours worked when he was not actually working, and after numerous counselings, he continues to not comply. We would like to terminate his employment. Will he be eligible for unemployment benefits? What paperwork must we provide at time of termination?	
4	We hired an employee and then terminated her due to performance 14 days later. We received a letter from her attorney stating that we terminated her for pregnancy. What steps do we take next?	
2	When terminating an exempt employee that you are offering a severance package to, do you have to have their final pay check at the time of termination in Colorado?	
1	We are dealing with a reduction of force. Reducing shifts at a facility. Terming 3 people. One is full time going to part time and other 2 are being termed. Do we have to reveal how the criteria of why they are chosen? And if they ask and we don't have to disclose that information, then what should we say about wanting to keep that confidential?	
2	Hello, We have an employee who had a workplace injury and failed a drug test when they went to the medical provider for an evaluation. If you have a drug free environment can you terminate for cause. Is there a standard adverse action letter you would need to provide? Thanks, Aggie Lewis	
1	We have an employee based In WI and we are based in CA. We will have a loss in business and will need to layoff our WI employee. We have alerted our employee that our customer contract will end on June 30th and at that point we will not have work for him. We told him we'd consider moving him to a position that is more senior, but after a few weeks, it is clear to us, he is not ready for a more senior position. Because we have no other opportunities for his level and skillset we will need to lay him off at the end of the contract. Couple of questions: 1. Are there any specific regulations we need to be aware of in WI in terms of laying off an employee? 2. We are considering actually laying him off earlier than June 30th, and offering to pay him through June 30th, if he signed a hold harmless waiver. Any issues with this? 3. Anything we need to be aware of that we are not considering?	
4	We have an exempt-employee with an At-Will Agreement ending in 6/30/17. She's been on maternity leave and is returning 5/15. Her position will only be available until 6/23/17, thereafter her position is eliminated to align positions across our network of schools. The position was re-scoped, moved to a different department, and became an hourly position. As a result, her supervisor is prepared to provide her with work during her last week from 6/24 - 6/30. We need to provide her with a written acknowledgment form that states her position is being eliminated. Do you have any sample templates we may use? Thank you!	
2	HI! Can you please send me what an employer should be handing out to an employee when they are terminated? A group said they pass out a form on HIPP from 2009 so i think that is outdated. Thank you!	
5	We were laying off an employee. We called him in the office to process the layoff and he bypassed me and went straight to the manager and was cussing him out and yelling at him. The Layoff went from that to to a termination. He has now lost his vacation because now termed. Policy states if termed no pay out for vacation time. If termed for cause then, no payment for vacation. He called this morning stating that his attorney assured him that he is entitled to his vacation pay. We do not have sick time. Is this true?	
2	Hi ThinkHR, If you lay someone off for lack of work - can you hire for that position without hiring that person back? Thank you. Annie	
5	I scheduled a meeting with an employee. By the end of the meeting he had resigned. I don't anticipate him returning any of the standard termination forms. Should I still provide them to him?	
5	A manager at a Burger King franchise was recently arrested and charged with sexual exploitation of a minor. He is currently out on bond. The Unit Manager confronted the employee and admitted that he did some things he shouldn't have and that he is going to plead guilty to a lesser charge. His next court date is May 31st. The restaurant does hire minors and has two currently working in the same store. They have suspended him and are wondering what their next steps should be. I assume this would be grounds for dismissal especially with two minors currently working. Thanks in advance!	
6	Employee's last day of employment is tomorrow. I am processing payroll today. Should I include her final check in today's transmittal?	
5	We have an employee who is not available to work the requisite shifts. When he is on down time, he is not wanting to work at non-transporting work here in the office. This is required when transporters have down time and are on the clock. We are proceeding with termination today and I just want to talk through things before that meeting.	
5	On April 14 an employee separated from the company, it was a mutual separation. He hasn't returned the items which he agreed to return during his exit interview. He has a computer and other electronic equipment. Whenever we reach him he says he'll drop it off at the location nearest to him but he doesn't. What should we do to make this more legal?	
5	Exempt manager provided his resignation to be May 15. He then had a medical emergency and has been out of work for past several days. We have no doctor's note to substantiate, and the manager has been working prior to the start of our business day, which is 7am (he is sending text messages to staff at 5am). The employee then sent us an email stating that he wants to extend his employment through May 31. Must we accept his change in resignation date, and must we pay him for the days that he is texting his staff?

1	We have a Director of Marketing/Communications who our CEO and other senior leadership has not been happy with for some time. However we have no documentation of poor performance for this individual, who is 60 years old. They are considering either moving immediately to termination or telling him that they are restructuring and then hiring a Marketing manager to replace him. I see inherent risk in both options.

He last worked approx 3.29.17 and he does not know the status of the employee's return. Fibromyalgia is his claimed reason, don't know if WC claim will be allowed.

He is contesting and we must have a hearing end of this month. He only worked for us for 6 weeks. How much UI will he be able to receive (state of CT)? Must I make copies of his file?

0	I am trying to calculate the amount of vacation to pay out to a part time employee who is leaving. She was hired in 2014 but used all her annual vacation each year. For 2017 she has used 10 hours. Her offer indicated she receives 50 hours of vacation each year. The offer does not state how time is accrued, just that it is on an accrual basis.	
5	I am terminating an EE tomorrow. He overused vacation and he signed a sheet saying if this happened he would repay. By taking the vacation owed, two week dental and medical premium, his net check falls below minimum wage for the hours he worked. Can I still take the full deductions?

1	We are going to terminate someone today. What are the rules for notice of termination?	
4	We are going to need to terminate someone. We have formally sat down with the employee. She has been talked to about errors and problems on numerous occasions. We did document as time has gone by things that were issues. We have an extensive list of things. When were doing employee reviews (the doctor likes to look at the reviews) he felt she needed to be terminated. She's a coder. They've lost confidence. We have been able to catch big amounts (such as $40k). They don't want a PIP. She has not accepted responsibility when we have talked to her. They would like to offer her severance package with a waiver and show her the mistakes.. We have not done her official review - she is the last person. She is over age 40 and has had some health issues and has asked for some accommodations over a period time. She has asked to take work home with her because she was missing work, during a phase of her not leaving well. She does leave early some days. She doesn't understand completely and she gets defensive. She blames things on other people. The people she blames is older than she is.If she has in hand the evidence, the review, and the severance and she gets to leave on her terms, present it as a resignation?

5	We have a driver that was in a bad accident on the job which was the fault of another carrier. He is still being paid through our worker's comp carrier and our w/c carrier is then going through the process of recouping the w/c wages from the other carrier that was at fault. The driver has been released to full duty, no restrictions to drive for us again. As an employer, can we terminate his employment if he refuses to take his job back that we held for him while he recovered?	
0	Our hourly employees are on an accrual based PTO entitlement. Our policy is that we pay it all out upon their separation from the organization. Our question is, if they do not honor their 2 week notice are we allowed to withhold that PTO payment? My thought process is no since it is based on hours worked.	
5	Massachusetts company now headquartered in SF. with only 2 still working in MA from home. Employee declined relocation to SF. He's applied to graduate programs and that's part of why he didn't want to move. He knows we're going to let him go due to the transitions with the company. Should I provide him a formal notice that termination will take place in 2 weeks?	
0	An employee's last day is today. He had been pre-approved to use vacation and a holiday. I wanted clarification about his vacation accruals for this last pay check. Generally employees earn about 6 hours of vacation per month. Since he only worked half the month is he owed half? Also do the days he's taking off affect his vacation accrual?	
1	I have an employee that we need to terminate for poor performance. There is a tool kit for termination I want to make sure that we are doing everything in the correct way. On the letter it said after a thorough review for the reason and you insert the reason and list prior warnings. We are a start-up and my paranoia is that if we list things too specifically it would create a liability. His manager has a weekly meeting with him and there have been a few deadlines that the employee has missed. These issues have also been addressed on his performance evaluation.	
3	My client is trying to mitigate risk associated with an involuntary termination of an employee who is turning out to be a poor hire with no hope of rising to the necessary level of performance for her role. The client is concerned about terminating the employee because she is over 40. The employee has been w/ company less than 3 months, and is a very mediocre performer. The plan was to start the employe out in a Customer Assistant role, with the hope that she could grow to be an escrow officer, but it's clearly not the case The client is looking to possibly remove the Customer Assistant role for now and then replace this employee with the actual more-senior role, However the client does also anticipate adding another Customer Assistant role in about 4 months. Can you please reply with the general best practices recommendation for mitigating risk from letting this employee go and replacing with a better hire in a more advanced role?	
6	We have an employee working in the State of Georgia who was let go as our client wanted him off the project. This employee has not returned clients property as yet. Can we withhold his final paycheck till he returns clients property (laptop, badge, key)? Is there a time period by which we are required to release his final paycheck even if he has not returned the property?	
4	We have an employee that we want to terminate for poor attendance. Since July she has called off 10 days, took bereavement, came in late 5 times, etc. Today she called in late and then called off the rest of the day. We feel work is no longer her priority and want to terminate. We've counseled several time but there's only 1-2 write-up's on file. Can we just call her?	
0	Overpayment of Wages We have a Salaried Store Manager in the state of Delaware who's separation information was not submitted to HR/Payroll in a timely manner. Due to this, the former employee was significantly overpaid so we're wondering what our options are.

6	An employee passed away after working for us a short time. A live check was issued and sent out to his address. His girlfriend is requesting that we reissue the check since she cannot cash it.

1	Employee went on STD then LTD with a last day worked in November 2016. Can we terminate at this point?	
5	My question is, I had to terminate someone today because of attendance. During the meeting he said that he was late on purpose so he can get fired. The manager and I were in the room and he also told this to a team lead the same thing. Can we deny him unemployment? Is this considered a deniable offence?	
1	We are outsourcing a department and the vendor is offering jobs to all the employees. We are considering offering a severance agreement if the employee does not elect to work for the vendor. Is is this unusual?	
1	We have an employee who is also family member and at this point, we believe it's in the company's best interest to terminate. The employee has issues getting along with others and several people have quit as a result of her leadership and rudeness. What are some of our choices? Is it risky to terminate? We are thinking of offering a severance agreement.

The employee has issues getting along with others and several people have quit as a result of her leadership and rudeness. What are some of our choices? Is it risky to terminate? We are thinking of offering a severance agreement.	
1	We are based in Missouri but have employees in Missouri and Minnesota. What is your opinion about sending out termination announcements. In the past, we have sent out a companywide email stating that the person is no longer working at the agency and the new point of contact in that person's absence. The email does NOT list the reason why the person is no longer with the agency. Is it a good business decision to send out this type of communication? If not, how do you recommend making the announcement to staff?	
4	We have an employee we had to discharge. We are trying to fight the unemployment and they said it was not misconduct. There were several situations where she was refusing to follow direction. She was bullying our employees. We were paying her final paycheck and she claimed there were some comp hours we owed her. She also says we owe her mileage. We saw she took some things from the office. Are we required to pay out the comp time? Can we withhold anything that is owed to her because of the things that were taken? We have the police investigating.

If I put my two weeks notice in today, 12/8/17, and I say that my last day is going to be Friday 12/22/17, can my employer say, no today will be your last day? If so, arey the obligated to pay the employee for the two weeks thru 12/22 or can they say that you'll be paid thru today thank you for your service?

4	Hello HR Rep: We have an employee who, while still actively working for us, applied for unemployment because she wanted extra income. She had a full schedule, but had been out of the office for a few weeks due to a heart attack that was none work related. Her Doctor cleared her to return to work and she did, but only for a few days, then claimed that she could not return do to doctor appointments. The reason unemployment had for her claim was: Voluntary Quit. This employee was eventually denied the unemployment benefits, therefore we are ready to terminate her immediately. So, I wanted to know what type of language to put in her termination letter? So that we are legally in compliance. We usually send out a general termination letter for no-show or not fulfilling scheduling hours, however we were not sure as to how to word a letter for this particular employee. Could you help with some sort of language that would suffice in this situation? Thank you! She stated that she wanted to voluntarily quit and filed for unemployment and the determination came back as voluntarily quit. We stated

5	We had an employee who resigned, giving us two weeks notice however, it was the week of Thanksgiving where we are off Thursday and Friday for holiday. He finished up his work on Tuesday and came in on Wednesday morning to drop off his van. Two questions: 1) do we have to pay him for the hours on Wednesday morning for dropping off the van that he failed to put into the payroll time card before we processed payroll for that week? 2) He is asking why he did not get paid for the two holidays and it is because he did not work the day after the holidays which our company handbook clearly states is required. I just want to confirm we are within our rights to set this as a requirement in our handbook to have to work the day before and day after the holiday to get paid. He wasn't even technically an employee on those days since his last day was the Tuesday before. Second I want to know if we have to pay him for the hours he did NOT put into the timecard for the Wednesday that he now thinks	
1	We terminated an employee last week and we received an unemployment paperwork. There were some terms I have questions about. Notice of hearing and workers' compensation claim. Connecticut Department of Labor. Form 1 is Separation Notification and Second is a Notice of Hearing/UI Claim. It asks what severance was paid and whether there was waiver of claims? It asks if the claimant received wages in lieu of notice. When we terminated today was his last day. Shutdown period? We have unlimited PTO - there's no vacation is that ok? Do I indicate discharge? We do not have an office in Connecticut - we have had customers in CT before... how do I answer? This person lived in Connecticut he came to the office in New York. I'll indicate he was working in New York. 7 days if separation was due to lack of work...?	
1	The question is we were notified today that one of our employees is deceased. Our payroll will be next week, Friday. The only information we have is ex spouse and son. The employee has direct deposit. can we direct deposit the check? or do we need formal documentation to distribute the fund?	
4	As a follow up to a previous issue, we have an employee who has been out on a leave for 3 months. She as to return from leave, but was not able to because we had no note from her doctor. She's saying she can't drive and that she won't see the doctor until 1/22 and the doctor want's her off until then. We are restructuring and we will be eliminating her position. All other position will be in an area where she can get to because of her inability to drive. we will need to lay her off. Are we okay in doing that?	
5	Hi, We have an employee who has a few no call/no shows. He has had a verbal and written warning. on his third incident, he was suspended without pay. His wife gave birth to a baby on Monday. He said he would be out on Tuesday (did not say anything about wanting to take PFL for CFRA time). He stated he would be in on Wednesday, but was another no call, no show. Can we term him since he has been warned verbally and written? Or, is he protected because we are aware his wife had a baby?

1	We have an employee that has not reported to work in going on 3 weeks. We are going to terminate the employee for job abandonment as outlined in our employee handbook. The employee has personal items in their drawer but we would like to box the employee's items up to free up desk space and in case the employee does not report back to work. Is there anything that we need make sure to document so nothing comes back on the employer? Just thinking of getting accused of taking some documents or items. It is our property (desk) so I don't believe so, just verifying.	
4	We have an employee who advised us of Jury Duty Monday 11/22 through Wednesday 11/24. We have not heard from her since, and have made numerous attempts to contact her with no response. Can we terminate her for job abandonment? We are concerned because California regulations indicated that employers cannot retaliate against employees for exercising their right to serve on a jury.	
0	If we go the outside sales employee route and pay only commission, how would we pay out any vacation accruals if we terminate and he made no sales?	
1	Next question is about fair labor standards act. If we have exempt salaried staff who work partial days, maybe leave one hour or 15 minutes early are we able to deduct that amount from their PTO banks? Also, if those same staff go into a negative PTO balance can we collect it at termination? The same we would if it was negative due to "planned vacations".	
4	Terminated employee final wages paid by debit card. Employee was told to report to work from 1 - 5p Upon arrival the employee was terminated. She was paid final wages with a visa debit card that did not have her name on it. When she took the card to her Credit Union she was told that she had to use the ATM machine to retrieve the funds because the card did not have her name on it. She was charged a fee for this transaction and was not able to withdraw all the funds. How many hours should she had been paid for showing up expecting to work but then immediately terminated and doesn't the fee(s) charged to withdraw her final wages violate CA law?	
2	Are there any State or Federal rules regarding payment of commissions after termination?	
5	An employee was arrested for possession of cocaine-class D felony. He is in jail and cannot make bail. We want to terminate his employment. Is this allowable under NY State law? He cannot work his shift- this is not the first time he will miss days at work, and he signed our employee handbook that states we can terminate if the employee is "Possessing, distributing or being under the influence of illicit controlled substances" and we are at-will.	
1	We are downsizing 20%, and employ approximately 50 employees. I'm looking for a few things: 1. Disparate treatment - tools, pivot tables, analysis. 2. Managers were looking at skills, needs, - matrix or something? If the need is to reduce salary expenses, I know that eliminated the high salary employees would mean less people, but could have adverse impact on age. How do we go about making these decisions when most of the employees are over 40 anyway?

3	An employee had been out for a few days and presented a doctor's note. Our policy is to always verify a doctor's note with the doctor's office. When we called the office, they said they had not seen the individual in the office, and when we faxed the note, they said that the signature is not theirs. We have a policy that first offense of fraudulent documents is termination. Are there any laws that would prevent us from terminating? Would he receive UI?

We would not be rehiring this position if we let him go. We have a team of employees in Armenia that is doing the bulk of what this employee is now doing.

5	I received the below email from one of my clients, I'm hoping you can assist: I have an employee who was hired at the beginning of January 2016. On September 13th, 2016 he was shot randomly and has remained on State Disability. Because he was only with us for 9 months he was NOT entitled to FMLA. In this employees absence we have continued to pay his medical 100%. While this employee has been absent we have learned many disturbing issues which he is involved in outside of work. Questionable judgment on his part with his extra-curricular activities, to say the least. Now he has been out since September 14, 2016 and sends us a text message that he wants to come back to work next week. Our opinion is that we prefer him not return to our establishment and go on his separate way. What are our ramifications if we terminate him? We have found in his absence that his position can be covered by other personnel on sight and we prefer to handle it this way.

5	Hi ThinkHR! Assistance needed on whether or not we are obligated by the state laws of South Carolina to pay unused Paid Time Off (PTO) to an hourly full-time employee who has been terminated. We are developing our PTO policy and he has not previously received a PTO policy or entitlement as a formal communication from HR. He may have gotten his hands on an old policy that would lead him to beleive that he started the year with 6 days of PTO entitlement. Not sure if it matters, but he was terminated for falsifying a large amount of time worked (about 40 hrs worth). He was not paid for the time he falsified since we caught on before payroll ran, however he was terminated immediately. He has contacted HR today asking for 7 days of PTO pay due to him according to SC law. He has threatened legal council if we do not pay him. Help!	
5	An employee has been with us since 2007 and work in VA. He is a driver and last year we received an email from our insurer saying we could not allow him to drive under our policy. We reached out to the employee and he said he wasn't aware his license was suspended or had issues. After a few weeks, he said his identity was compromised and this resulted in issues with his driver license. We continued to follow up and he finally said it would take a long time to resolve and that he could not guarantee when he would have an active license. After a few months we placed him another job. It is not working out because we don't have enough work for him. We followed up again at the start of the year and he said he didn't know whether it would be resolved. At this point we feel we want to terminate because we don't know when/if ever he will be able to resume his duties as a driver.

1	We are looking at a minor restructure with our sales force. We currently have two representatives in Chicago. The volume is low for both of the territories and we are proposing combining the territories into one. The cost to keep both territories as full time is not feasible. We would remove Milwaukee from the Chicago territory and hire a 1099-part time person there then have just one person in the Chicago market. Since performance is poor for both employees and their end of year reviews are the same, the tenure with the company could be the deciding factor on which one to keep since one was hired externally this summer and one was promoted to this role internally and has been with our company for about three years. I want to make the changes effective Jan. 1. I would keep the person employed through the end of the year and pay them their earned commission for the Q4. Is this fair on how to make the decision of who to keep and would I be in compliance with terminating the other?

5	An employee has not been doing the job well for a couple months - the employee has been with the company quite a while. He's a supervisor but does not act as a supervisor. He's an irrigator and has caused problems that require us to bring in multiple people. I had him in my office and we talked to him last week. He chuckled when I told him it was costing expenditures. He's telling us now he wants to go out on unemployment. Our owner wants to show him what he's doing wrong as he is working. He refused to shovel. He said it will fix itself. He's older and set in his ways. Because he's older he doesn't want to do the job well anymore. This is a year round, not seasonal job. He wants to go to Mexico. He tried to tell me the owner terminated him. I need to issue him his last check. He terminated himself - how do I respond to unemployment?	
5	On Saturday an employee came in intoxicated for his 11pm to 7am shift. Usually a manger isn't duty. This is a 24-hour ALF.

I told her she could send him for a drug screen - she didn't do that. She can't reach him to tell him not to come in tonight. She is concerned about safety and is worried about retaliation. I think she has grounds for termination. If he returns and retaliates what the safest measure to protect our employees and residents. She is suspicious he is doing other stuff besides alcohol - she has noticed some weird stuff going on in the evenings. We don't have security - should I get the police involved in this? He was ranting Saturday about his life falling apart and he threatened to commit suicide by gun.

1	From : sharonh@edgebanding-services.com Subject : Hello ThinkHR, With regards to this issue, we have been told on several occasions that we would be receiving a fax from this employees doctor. Nothing as of yet. Can we terminate his due to the non-response? Regards, Sharon	
1	We are looking to do a layoff 7 to 8 employees in the next few days, based on finances. Would we be able to then bring back only a couple of these employees? What about hiring others? Can we bring one developer back as an independent contractor?	
1	RIF - looking at the cost of doing the RIF and options on reducing the cost of RIF. Our practice is to pay one week of severance for every year of employment, with no cap. We are considering changing our practice to have severance cap at a certain amount. Should we inform the employees in advance of the change in policy? What is the standard amount of severance?	
5	In October we had a sexual harassment case open. The first day we found out the manager sent him home and when we got to the office we started the investigation. After all the interviews there were no findings against the employee and he was called to come back and he asked if he could think about it and he never called or came back and we sent a no-call, no-show letter and after a week we terminated him. We did not pay for the days that he was out due to the suspension. How do we move forward.? He is a non-exempt hourly employee. He was under worker's compensation during that time. I believed that we have received something about law suit. The final paycheck was mailed out overnight; however, when his manager suspended him, he told him that he would be paid for the time that he was on suspension.	
4	question regarding an employee on probation status. had a meeting last Wednesday with an employee regarding her performance. At the end of the meeting she was placed on a 30 day probation period. Follow up was scheduled for Monday of this week, when she was to bring solutions to her performance issues. The follow up meeting was held Monday, with no solutions being offered by the employee. Instead she had more of an adversarial position. After that meeting it was discovered that there are still performance issues. Knowing that Indiana is an i12at willi12 employment State, I am uncertain if an employer is required to wait the 30 days for the chance of employee improvement, or if termination could take place before the time period of 30 days?	
4	We have a former employee who has been with us for 5 months and she was having trouble showing up to her shifts on time. She ended up no call no showing or texting her supervisor 15 minutes before her shift. We became aware that her husband was in a car accident and needed time to care for him. We talked to her about it December 4th. She said she did not need a leave of absence. She then texted us she quit, I wasn't treated well and did not show up to her shift. She has now contacted the executive director saying this was not fair and she was not aware of the option to take a leave of absence. In the December 4 conversation it appeared she wanted to just move forward and did not want to take leave. Her supervisor documented the meeting. She then texted to quit December 5th. She sent an email to the executive director and I believe it was because I was busy at the time. Should I contact her or the director to circle back on the complaint?	
1	An employee has a long standing performance issue - we think its time to proceed with termination - we have not seen much improvement. We have documentation, one concern I have is that he is eligible for discretionary annual bonus from the company that we distribute in February. He joined the company late October 2016. How much bonus depends on bonus - we haven't closed our finances - what's your opinion? We've never paid out bonus after someone has been terminated. You have to be active to receive it. He has an employment agreement. I don't think there are any terms regarding the bonus. "you are eligible for the company's year-end bonus program" and nothing else. I don't think we have a policy. What is the risk? Can we mention why the employee was terminated when we announce that he is no longer with the company?	
1	I was just alerted that there were some internal changes happening. Our team lead for customer service is under performing. I don't believe any formal feedback has been provided and I believe we were going to proceed with a PIP. Also, it sounds like they are now going to move the role to San Diego. It sounds like it will be the whole team that will move eventually. There is a new person we are thinking of moving to that location. The timeline for the change will be to notify the individuals this week. The team would move first week of January. Short timeline.	
0	We have an employee in Massachusetts who has resigned. When would we need to provide her final pay with vacation payout?	
1	We have an employee who was a no call no show. Called multiple times. No response. We called and said we take it you no longer want to work. We said we were going to hold the final pay until they brought their key back. I want to know if that was okay to say.	
1	We have n agreement with our local union to bring a suspended employee back to work with the stipulation that any further occurrences will result in their immediate termination of employment.

Yesterday the employee was very upset and said that she quit. one hour later the ex employee came back with another person (not an employee) and began filming on the property and was saying she was fired because she was pregnant. She told one of the workers she was fired because she was pregnant. employer does not know what to do to have employees stop spreading rumors. Employer is concerned that they are USDA and private property so what should they do about the filming. Any issues with filming? is it ok to send certified mail the final paycheck due to voluntary term? does employee need to sign something if quit?	
3	I have a client in Contra Costa County, CA. They terminated an employee, however, they did not get their uniform back. The uniform has the employer's name on it and they are worried about someone who does not work for them anymore wearing it. How can they get this uniform back?	
2	Our president turned in his resignation on November 29th. I am looking at his executive agreement and the termination section states that if the employee decides to terminate agreement, each party must give 3 months of notice. The resignation notice states he gives 3 months notice per the agreement. If they decide to let him go earlier than the 3 months notice, do we have to pay him?

4	We just had a situation with an employee in a leadership role who was disgruntled, stating the employer was not treating employees fairly, and practiced favoritism. She complained of migraines, so the employer gave her the FMLA paperwork, and began treating her as FMLA eligible even though we never received any supporting documentation back from her or her doctor. On Friday, she turned in her laptop and other company property, and left work. We assumed she resigned. We received a letter dated today stating that she is resigning because of the work environment and that she felt the employer was not going to accommodate her. She wants to be paid for Monday and Tuesday as FMLA leave.	
4	Employees get 32 hours of sick pay upfront upon hire. The employee has used all her time throughout the year, and the employee is now terminating.

3	Separation - planning to terminate an employee. Want to be a bit vague on the reason to protect the client. He has a propensity for saying things to customers that should not be said. Not being professional. Against code of ethics policy. I'm looking for ways to advise the person for how to describe why they are not working there. Allow the employee to resign. If they refuse, process involuntary termination. Give the employee a choice. They still might be able to get unemployment, it depends on the state.

3	An "employee" died while they were not working due to a lay-off. The employer has $1,864 that belongs to the employee. These were funds that were put aside ($5 of prevailing wage to be used for medical premiums). They tried to send to his bank via direct deposit, however the account was closed.

One of the employee's at that location is planning on retiring in 2019, and other employee is younger. The older employee has been having difficulty adapting to technology, and having performance issues. She's no longer an RN. We do have a research arm. We could offer her a position with that research team. This would reduce her pay.

5	We have an employee who has been having performance issues after six months of employment and is taking off a lot of time. We were going to terminate but then he fell ill and has been out until last week. Doctor's note was generic and didn't provide a return to work release.

4	With Ann (broker) and Denise: An employee has left my employment under strange circumstances. December 1st was the last day of the pay period (biweekly). On Monday the 4th she called in sick, and one the 5th. On the 6th she asked for a MLOA. I responded and asked what the timeline was for the leave. I reached out again on the 7th and we received a resignation from her later that day. The deductions from that check included premiums for the prior plan year. She has been non-communicative. I emailed her Monday that we had received her resignation and asked to confirm her address for COBRA notification. Her resignation letter was addressed to myself and my husband (the president). He couldn't find it and I sent it to him (I still had it open). I now cannot find it, either. She texted him, telling him to download an app called Marco Polo? How do I reach out to her and tell her that there are 3 health plans she's enrolled in. Vision and dental are employee funded. The medical is where we share contributions. I believe she needs to take ownership of her portion of the December premiums - benefits go through December 31st. Her last day of work was 12/1. For the termination notice, 12/7 or 12/1? Should I mention the December premiums?	
3	I've got people wanting to take time off without pay. I know that some people get assistance from unemployment. If they voluntarily take time off unpaid are we on the hook for unemployment?

He was a no call/no show a couple of days ago and we gave him a final warning. He is back in jail since Thursday. We have an occurrence policy. Since he is on a final warning, we would like to terminate, is that ok?

5	We are having an issue with an employee. We have always had problems regarding performance and put on a PIP and after 30 days he was fine and then he started not clocking out, not logging in and not completing any work . We were about to write him up again. We found out he had a deliverable and rushed to do it and sent it to the wrong information. He tried to handle it on his own and hid it and we did not inform our risk management department. If he had not tried to hide it we would not be considering termination. Can we forgo that final written warning? We have documentation on the clock outs and not being available or working when at home. We also have emails from the client that received the incorrect information and emails showing that the employee hid the error.

1	We have an attendance policy in place that issues points for time used, with disciplinary action occurring at 10 points, 5 points and 0 balance. We are considering changing our policy to disallow any excused absences. This would put us in the situation of issuing points for someone missing time due to a subpoena court order. Are we allowed to issue points and more importantly discipline someone if they reach the level of 10 due to missing for court?

4	Employee hired in October has not shown up for work for several weeks. She claimed its because she broke up with her boyfriend and is having a difficult time. She and her supervisor had scheduled some meetings to discuss her situation, but each time, she has cancelled or failed to show up. Can we terminate her?	
5	I'm looking for guidance on how to handle a situation that just took place. I was in my office with another employee with my door closed. I suddenly hear yelling, screaming, profanity, slamming on a desk and finally a door slammed shut which shook the walls. The employee has returned and appears to be okay working however, he has a history of emotional instability. The staff has difficulty communicating and dealing with him, he is difficult to manage. How should I handle this; we're considering termination.	
3	I have an employee that has reached the points allowed per our attendance point policy at least a month and a half ago. Once an employee reaches 14 points, they are terminated. Termination was not performed at this time because they are looking for a skilled replacement. Since then the employee has been given additional points for two more days missed. Once a qualified replacement is found, they plan to proceed with the termination of this employee. What risks does that cause the company of not following their own policy when the limit is reached and terminating at a later date for exceeding points. I don't believe any documented coaching has been given to the employee. I am new in HR field and want to minimize any risks associated with terminating this employee.

We are faith based organization, and we have a zero tolerance policy regarding alcohol. Ultimately after an investigation and must through we are going to be terminating him employment because of the physical altercation, we alsolutely cannot allow him to continue working after he struck another employee. He called out Monday and Tuesday, and when he came in today I was to speak with him and he did mention that he was having some issues with anxiety and had taken some medication, which could have caused him to drink. While we cannot continue to employ him because of the violent altercation, we want to make sure that provide him with resources to get help should be need it. We will make sure he knows about our health care and about COBRA. What else might you suggest? Houston, TX area.

2	Severance agreements. Over age 40 have to be given 45 days to consider the offer. When does that 45 days start? When given the agreement to review, or after their last day of employment?	
4	We have decided to terminate an employee. We have received many complaints about her for being loud, huffing out of frustration, mumbling complaints under her breath, tossing things on her desk. She claims coworkers are bullying her but cannot provide an example and when I question her coworkers and their peers, all I hear is that these coworkers have been observed trying to help her. We don't know what reason to give her. We plan on offering a severance. Looking for a second opinion.

1	We are going through a cutting back phase and need to let an employee go. It has nothing to do with performance. We have to cut a position, and there are 3 employees in the position. The person being cut was the last person hired, but he is also the oldest. I've heard employers can get into trouble with age discrimination and want to talk about that with someone. We are planning to have his last day and last payment made before the end of the year. Our last payroll is on 12/22.	
5	How long do you have to wait to terminate an employee who is on workers compensation? he didn't qualify for FMLA and won't be returning to his original position due to dr. restrictions. Assuming we can't make reasonable accommodations either.

She received a verbal warning 12/11 for her unscheduled absences and she signed an agreement saying she would not have any other unscheduled absences. She was to start at 11 and it is now 1230. 3 consecutive workdays without notice are job abandonment.

1	We have an employee we are laying off as of the end of the year. We advised the employee that although the staff reduction is due to a reduction in store hours (closing on Saturdays) she was chosen for layoff over other staff members due to past performance issues. Now she is spreading rumors among employees and past employees that more layoffs are coming and they'd better beware. Any advice on how to approach this?	
4	An employee was hired on November 20. Since then, she has had occassions of violations of safety rules and she has had numerous absences for a variety of reasons. The company would like to terminate her. What type of termination letter should they provide to her? Is there a more specific letter that you have because the termination is due to violation due the probationary period?	
4	We have an employee that stated to HR she was planning to put in her resignation letter on the upcoming January 18th because she got new job. She reported this December 11th over the phone. Her last day with the agency would then be January 1st. Yesterday December 13th she brought in a letter that stated she is under doctors care and should be excused from work until January 3rd. Nothing more than that. We do have a policy that once you resign you can't use your accrued time off in order to allow for closing up with current work load. She is not on FMLA. At this time can we accept her verbal resignation effective immediately while being in compliance with federal regulations? Thanks!	
3	We have a retail client with 19 states that they want to close doors on. This equates to 81 employees and 51% of their total workforce. No one location has 50 or more employees.

4	We have a delivery driver who has a lot of drama around her. Today we have reportedly had calls from her family members which caused us concern for her safety. Just after receiving the phone calls and before the employee had arrived for work, the police department was at work, knocking on our door and they needed to lay eyes on her. She was late this morning. Since the employee wasnt onsite yet, they asked us to call them when she came back. We did, then they came back so they could observe and talk with her. She was a NCNS earlier this week. As it turns out, she and her domestic partner had an argument and she was in jail for the NCNS. Today she had a swollen foot and was limping. The police officer was observing her to see if she was a threat to herself. Once that was done, I let her know that I was going to send her home today as I cant put you in a van today, for liability purposes I cant put you in the van. Because of the drama we sent her home and let another employee drive her home as she smelled a bit like alcohol. The police said that the daughter had called them saying that the Mom, our employee, was going to commit suicide today. The officer observed her and we told him that we were going to send her home today, he thought that was a good idea. Before sending her home, we asked her Are you okay to go home and do you feel safe being there? She said yes it was ok. We had someone take her home, so she wasnt driving. In addition to her daughter and family members calling, her ex-husband called someone else in our company saying he was concerned about her wellbeing, drug use and suicide threat. Then her ex-husband also showed up here and thought she was back on her drug thing. We only do reasonable suspicion or post injury, although due to the driving requirement we also do testing as needed to ensure safe to drive. We want to know if we can terminate her? We want to know if we can drug test her?

On Monday we told him we would decide the proper approach for disciplining based on his most recent interaction with his manager. On Thursday, the employee stated his plan on moving forward and trying to work better with his coworkers but refused to work with his manager on this. He's unwilling to work with or involve his manager. Based on our policy, several actions could lead to termination. Do we need to issue a written first?	
1	We are currently considering terminating an employee due to performance issues. We have had conversations with the employee and some documentation, the file is not 100% good. The employee is a women under 30 and will be replacing with a women over 40. We are a New York employer. New employee has more experience however will be the same job title. If you are terminating for cause, would it be contradictory to offer a severance agreement that protects the company further.	
0	I have a question the "Final Wages" section of the following link in Comply specific to South Carolina: (https://thinkhrcomply.com/ReferenceHome/StateLaws/SouthCarolina#/ReferenceHome/ManagingEmployees/Termination/SouthCarolinaTermination) whether an employee is entitled to receive pay for any earned but unused vacation and/or sick time depends upon the companys policy. State law does not require that employers provide benefits such as vacation or sick time. However, if an employer decides to do so, it must give notice of the policy to the employee, abide by the policy, and not discriminate in administration of the policy. Based on that statement Im trying to determine whether we are required to pay out Sick time accrued if we choose to offer Sick time, or if the statement is saying that whether or not pay out sick time is based on our policy. We do NOT pay out sick time upon termination per our written policy. We are a Colorado employer with one remote worker in South Carolina	
6	If an employee walks off the job, can the employer send the final pay check via mail and can it be paid at next pay date or must it be within 72 hours? Thank you.	
1	We are doing a severance agreement and we need to include the 7 day revocation period. What age requires this additional period?	
3	When can an employee be terminated?	
1	OWBPA - Does that apply if we are terminating an older worker due to performance? Do we have to have a waiver of claims? Do we have to provide severance?	
4	We had an employee who was terminated based on a reduction in force. We paid out her final wages and just have an expense reimbursement check that we need to send out to her in the amount of $66. Meanwhile, she has not returned our computer equipment, and is stating she will not do so until she gets the expense reimbursement check. Is she able to do this?	
6	I'd like to have written verification from them based on Texas law before we change anything. 1. Can we hold an employee's final paycheck until they have returned all company property? 2. Can we, at our discretion, switch an employee from direct deposit to live check? Or make it a standard policy that their final check will be a live check?	
3	Kathrin Kaehler, HR Manager, 310-210-5194 kathrin@symbioticentertainment.com Our company is closing its doors today. Must we provide employees with their expense reimbursements? What if the company is unable to afford to reimburse for employees' business expenses?	
4	Regarding manager that on Friday she said she was resigning May 30th because of her supervisor. I said okay. Today she is asking to stay until June 30th. I really don't want to do that but I don't have a resignation in writing either. The scenario is: This employee recently finished her degree and has started her own business similar to ours. We are concerned that keeping her on will allow her to access our records, clients, etc. and can jeopardize our business further. She has been an underperformer and has been talked to several times by her supervisor about improving. Recently the supervisor, in holding her accountable gave her 30 days to improve her sales. This has not happened and in fact this week we had planned to terminate her employment. We think it would be better for her to leave on her own. We are in the middle of a training/campaign and she is asking to stay through that time, June 30th, but it would allow her six or more additional weeks of access for her to build her own business and info from ours. We do not want to keep her past her original resignation date. Also, we are thinking of honoring her original resignation date, but in a day or two, letting her know she doesn't need to report to work, collect her company equipment, but still pay her through the 31st.	
5	We have an issue with one of our employees. He used his FMLA last year, returning to work at the end of 2016. He is a salaried employee (exempt), however, we have been treating him as an hourly, non-exempt employee because he hasn't been working full time. From January 2017 he has worked three to four weeks. We have inquired about his return, and he will state he is returning but does not. We would like to terminate his employment at this time but want to minimize our risk.	
3	This question is for our client, Southern Air. They have an active employee that is currently in the hospital with a brain injury and is on Short Term Disability. Historically, once the employee has been on STD for six month, they are terminated. It is not listed in their handbook. What is the appropriate time to terminate an employee in this type of situation?	
5	Q 1 of 2 I have a maintenance supervisor who quit on Saturday. He came in on Saturday and took tools..some were his some were not. He did not leave his keys. He has a pending loan with the company and still owes money. What can I do about it?	
5	Employee started in Jan. and has had 5 corrective actions so far for tardy, attendance, and 2 related to medication errors. This weekend he was caught sleeping on the shift while he was supposed to be watching a patient. We are ready for termination. He disclosed to the supervisor he has problems with sleep. We went through an interactive process but he says the doctor won't fill out paperwork. Are we at risk if we termination without giving him a final warning first.	
3	We have a group that has about 80 employees. They have one employee that was terminated on 5/2,. The group is asking if employee or group is responsible for any balance of premium payment. The benefits are active through end of month. Please provide info on this. Thank you.	
5	We found out one of our managers has been stealing from us. Do we have to have a check ready for him? Can he get unemployment?	
1	We are a California construction company . . . we have had to recently layoff a few carpenter type employees. When work picks up - are we required to bring them back . . . or can we hire? Is there a time frame? Thanks! Leona@brasciabuilders.com	
5	Q 1 of 2 - In regards to our own employee. We are letting him go today. I want to verify I have all the correct paperwork for him. I have unemployment notice to employee and he is under 90 days- I don't have to give him COBRA or HIPPA since not on benefits plan, right?	
3	2-One of our Clients is letting an employee go. They are giving him a severance package. The employee was asking if he could stay on health insurance plan. The employer doesn't really want to do that, but is it even allowed? To allow employee to stay on plan?	
5	We recently provided a renewal contract to one of our teachers and he agreed to and signed the contract for the new school year. However, we have had performance issues with him that have been documented and he has been counseled for. Due to a recent absence that he took during a big event at the school, we determined that it was the final straw and we would like to terminate his employment. However, he is scheduled to be the leader on a school trip that is scheduled to occur 2 weeks after this school year ends, mid June. If we term him now, we will have no replacement for him. Can you advise?	
4	One of the employees who is leaving has her last day today (5/15/2017). Since we are paid semi-monthly, this is her last regular paycheck. She has accrued vacation time (20.22 days). You need to know that she has agreed not to have her 20 vacation days paid out in a lump sum. We will pay her for 10.11 days on the 5/31 payroll and the other 10.11 days on 6/15/17. When someone leaves mid-month, I have always deducted insurance premiums for the entire month and kept their coverage through the end of the month in which they left. Blue Cross always changes a full month premium anyway. I would NOT have taken out any insurance premiums on the 6/15 payroll since in my mind her coverage ceases 6/1/2017. So, she came to me today and said she spoke to a lawyer. The lawyer stated that as long as she is being paid vacation pay she is still considered an employee and would be entitled to insurance coverage. Do you know if this is true?	
3	If a California employer does not issue a final paycheck within 72 hours when an employee quits, can the employer be fined? Where would the employee file a complaint? If the company is with a Union would they go to the union with a complaint or to the DIR.ca.gov?	
1	Hi. We don't normally conduct background checks and recently hired a new employee whom upon googling came up under the registered sex offenders directory. Wondering if we as the employer have any precedent to dig deeper or decline employment altogether based on this.	
0	1 Paying out for Vacation at termination	
5	An employee worked for a week and then called out stating that he had to go to the hospital. He then stated that he had injured himself at work so we submitted a workers compensation claim. He was placed on light duty and assigned physical therapy. He does not show up to work and does not attend his doctor appointments. Can the company terminate him for company violations?	
1	One of our sites is closing in Jun 2018. We are contractors that run their waste water treatment facility. Our lead operator is critical to our success and we want to encourage him to stay until the end. We think three months pay will be sufficient to entice him to stick it out, so we don't have to find someone for a very short period of time (if he leaves for another job 60-90 days from contract closure). Can we keep him as an employee with full benefits for 90 days? In other words, we pay his salary and benefits for 90 days. Or is it better to just pay him a lump sum? Does one way or the other affect employment claims on his behalf? I can be reached at 765-490-8442 to discuss as I am sure there are many details I need to consider. Thanks. Mike Silver PS - our office is in IN, but this employee is geographically separated and works in Trenton, MO.	
1	We just had a rough termination due to performance. I just wanted to make sure I have everything and bounce some things off of somebody.	
3	We are non profit in NY with around 35 employees. We have an employee who works in NY office. Position is being eliminated. Last day will be this Friday. Offered a severance package. We were going to pay that out on the 31st (last day the 19th). They just asked in terms of NY eligibility for unemployment. The severance could deem them ineligible for unemployment. If they get their severance after 30 days, they may be able to get it. What are the rules regarding severance and unemployment?	
1	Hello! We would like to move forward with terminating an out of state remote employee in Florida but we are a primarily based in California. Are there any termination laws we need to be aware of for Florida? It looks like we don't have to have final pay ready same day but on the next payroll period. Thank you!!	
4	We have a new employee who provided her two week notice and stated she felt she was not fit for the position. She explained the next day that she was having issues with her manager. We opened an investigation on Thursday. On Friday she advised she was not going to go back to her office because of the situation. Sent her home for the day. On Sunday night the executive team someone passed away suddenly in a motorcycle accident. She came back to work business as usual. We received statements from her supervisor and other employee in the office. Tuesday she gave two weeks. We asked for this in writing. She left and we paid her final wages that day. She has subsequently send a 6 page letter stating the reasons she left and accusing the HR department of not acting on her complaints. We haven't even had the chance to finish the investigation.	
4	We have an employee that was hired two months ago. The manager at the time believed her explanation for her misdemeanors and hired her anyway. Two months in and the manager has left the company. The new manager is upset with her performance as a sales person and would like to let her go due to performance issues. We are an 'at will' state and her lack of sales performance is all we need to end her employment. Her record shows that she has a volatile personality and she has proven it by confronting the manager about supposed rumors he has started about her. This confrontation happened after only working with her for a week and barely speaking to her. It is a false accusation that she has made towards the management/ownership staff. I'm concerned about her reaction to a termination. Are there suggestions on the best way to proceed?	
2	Marijuana possession at work place	
4	We have an employee who has had conflicts with her manager and we are looking to terminate. She has openly challenged feedback from her manager and complained about how the department is run. On Friday she had an outburst in which she was yelling at her manager in front of everyone in the office and it was so bad others were complaining and refused to work with her. We sent her home that day and would like to terminate her. 20	
6	(CES Consultants, Inc.) Good morning, Our company is based out of Florida but we also have an office in New York. When an employee is terminated and has to return equipment i.e. laptop, cell phone, etc. may I include in my departing email that they must return the equipment in order to receive their final pay check? Thank you.	
3	We are hiring paid interns to work for 12 weeks. Will they be able to apply for UI benefits? Are seasonal employees able to apply for UI benefits?	
1	We are looking at slightly restructuring some of our organization's positions. Involved in this would be the reduction of pay and/or hours for a current employee. Do you have guidance on how to manage this change/legal steps we need to be mindful of?	
2	Hello, Is there a template for termination notices relating to "Notice to Employee as to Change in Relationship" for the state of California? I believe this would have to be compliant with the Provisions of Section 1089 of the California Unemployment Insurance Code. Please let me know what you think. Thank you! Kathy Au Yeung kathya@chegg.com	
1	We are working on so automation in our manufacturing plant. This automation could potentially reduce our shifts of 13 to 10 people. We do not have a RIF policy is our handbook currently and we employee more than 100 employees in the state of Nebraska. I know any temporary employees would be the first to go and we can consider the following: Seniority, performance, job classification or knowledge. In case we need to RIF instead of reassign is there criteria that I should be considering that I have not listed?	
3	If an employee is out on FMLA, can the employer terminate and employee during employment. The employer wants to ensure that he life insurance will be portable so they'd like to terminate.	
3	Put an employee on a PIP. Employee was later written up for a breach of confidentiality (HR staff) when disclosed salary. How do we phrase the termination.	
1	We had an employee give notice and the manager would like him to complete only one week. The employee agreed. Do we need to pay him the full two weeks, or is one week sufficient?	
5	I am looking for guidance for firing an employee who we think was stealing from us. We have a history of money missing. Today in front of our president he pocketed money and deleted the invoice. I want to make sure we follow the proper procedure. We had a customer come in (we don't deal a lot with cash). An inside sales employee was taking cash from the customer - over $600 for an invoice. My mom (the president) saw the money change hands. When she came by to ask what happened, he said the purchase was made my credit card. She and the manager looked in the system and found he had deleted the invoice. We have no credit card transaction for this or a close amount. He kept denying what happened and was saying he wasn't aware of what had happened. We've been trying to get the customer on the phone to provide a statement as far as what happened. He's had money disappear in the past, but could not confirm it was him. I don't think we want want to get the police involved unless we have to. I was just going to write a termination letter in the morning. I reconcile everything and do not do delete invoices. We got a safe and money stopped disappearing. My mom saw him receive the cash.	
6	My question has to do with wage and hour and final pay regulations in the District of Columbia. Is it permissible to try to re-coupe a signing bonus form a final pay check in the District of Columbia?	
5	Employee's girlfriend was injured and he took off and was out of contact for a few days. Finally heard back and he said he would plan on returning soon. He's now disappeared again. Best practice on how to handle?	
1	We are going to let go an employee who is still in a 60 day probationary period. Looking for guidance as to how to draft the termiantion letter.	
4	We are a Japanese travel agency serving mostly Japanese communities in US. Therefore, near-native Japanese language skill is essential as an employee. We hired an individual in April who's not a native Japanese speaker but had lived and worked in Japan as a travel agent for more than a few years. The hiring manager thought through the job interviews that her Japanese was very good so we hired her. We gave her an intensive training for the first 3 months but the progress was slow and unsatisfactory, and as we tried to analyze the the problem, she began maternity leave for 15 weeks. She returned to work 2 weeks ago and as we resumed her training, we noticed her Japanese became even worse. If her language problem stays, any training is a waste of time and we cannot let her communicate with customers. Can we terminate her based on the lack of language skill or put her on an unpaid leave until her Japanese improves. We're worried about the timing, too, as she just had a baby.	
5	I have an employee that has been changing settings on the company computer he uses. He is very knowledgeable in IT. We have an activtrc on company computers that he discovered when looking where he shouldn't. He has since been sending owner threatening messages on the screen shots to the owner and management. What are the consequences if we terminate him due to this?	
5	Follow up regarding employee who is out of the leave on medical (non-FMLA, non-CFRA, non-disability) leave. He has not applied for SDI. He gave us a note where he will be out for a period of time. Can we legally term this person once they are cleared to return? He has not completed/passed our 90 day review for new hires. We gave him an extra 60 days. I called to check on him because we hadn't heard from him in 4 days. He stated he didn't want to do short-term disability and his doctor gave him 3 weeks off. He asked to return because he was going "stir crazy." Everybody has a 90 day introductory period. Apparently he has not passed that and he was given more time.	
4	We have an employee who put in 2 weeks notice. We would like to end her employment and not pay her the 2 weeks.	
5	Submitted by John at Broker: An employee is a grandfather - his child had a child and the employee put the grandchild and the self-funded plan. He's thinking about paying the claims, but it looks like he is going to have to terminate this employee, and is concerned if he pays the claims, it might subject him or the company to liability if the employee tried to pursue lawful termination. He doesn't want to open himself up to a lawsuit. It sounds as if this is the reason for termination? I am not sure if the child is a dependent. I think the employee said "I had a baby" and added a baby and the baby. When would benefits end and would COBRA not come into play for the child, even if benefits end now, instead of back to when the child was put on the plan? This employee has been litigious in the past and sued workers' compensation. With James: The child was born in August and came onto the plan in September, retro to the birth date. The employee was in my office during OE and I asked him if he needed to make changes, and he said no, my grandson is added... then corrected himself and said his son. The grandson is living with him. I asked the manager and he said the employee said it what his son, and presented it that way, when in fact its not. I talked to him in my office and feigned a language barrier. I'm at a cross roads - other employees have asked about adding grandchildren and I've had to tell them no. I need to get this child off the plan as of today. Do I go back to August and have the insurance company undo all of the charges and put the liability back onto the parent? If I just terminate coverage and I don't seek restitution, would that negate anything going forward. His employment has come into question and we decide to separate ourselves, do I lose credibility in a lawsuit? Is this enough for termination? Do you have a legal referral? John has a referral.	
1	We have 3 employees that we would like to do a temporary layoff for. Option to have them re hired in Jan. Do you have a template we can use?	
4	We want to temporarily lay off some of our employee due to being slow and performance and one has been with us for a long time. Her behavior has been destructive to the work flow. Is there any insight to how we should handle this?There is an incident when she exploded in the plant and resigned and we accepted it and then my boss did not like this and we brought her back. We have documented her inappropriate behavior.	
4	I have an issue with an employee who voluntarily termed on Friday was her last day. I was out of office so I sent her a text saying check would be mailed Monday. She did not receive her check until the 13th. Now she is demanding waiting time pay.	
2	If laying off employees, can you send over information regarding any laws pertaining to layoffs and severance agreements?	
1	We will be terminating a supervisor due to performance, a few write-ups on file, no long-term improvement. Does it make a difference if we lay him off versus terminating. We don't plan on fighting the unemployment claim.	
4	An employee resigned with her last day of employment being Jan. 2, 2018. She currently works in California but her last two weeks of work will be performed in Maryland. When is her final check due? Should we mail it out?	
3	Employee was hired a few days ago (12.12.17) cannot provide Form I-9 documentation. Does the employer have to set her up as an employee?	
3	I have a question in regards to an employee who is about to leave the company. If the employee put in their two weeks, does vacation count?	
5	John on the line as well- we have an employee that was arrested for legal matters for personal reasons. The arrest happened at work. He went to jail, made bail and came back a few days later. He said he had to deal with a lot of court stuff. Now he wants his regular schedule back. He is being very demanding. We had to find someone to cover his shifts. Restaurant business and we are very busy due to holiday season. Is he protected due to his arrest? Are we obligated to give him back his shift? The arrest is related to molesting an under-aged person. Word is spreading. We are hearing that he has been acting inappropriately, allegedly, with other employees. The employees are concerned for their safety. We are not sure what we should do?	
3	Employer is terminated 11/6/17, and they kept employee on payroll and benefits until 12/31/17. Is that typical? Usually employers remove the employee from payroll when employment ends, correct? What should they do about situation?	
6	If an employee quits voluntarily in the state of California do you need to pay them two hours of pay to come in and pick up their final check? Normally I mail the final check w/in 72 hours but our payroll company always asks me if I want to pay them two hours of extra pay....to which I state "no" as they are coming back voluntarily to pick up vs. being mailed. Thank you!	
1	We are a C-Corp in California with 24 employees. SOP has us provide 3 written warnings to employees before terminating them. However, we imagine that some infractions may provide suitable cause for immediate termination. Are we correct? When employees actively violate policies by buddy punching or leaving and returning to work without punching-out, may we terminate without giving warnings? If not, please give us an example of workplace infractions would justify immediate termination. Thanks.	
1	1 of 2: We are looking to terminate an employee who is a resident of Wisconsin who is age 68. We think it is time and he is not ready to leave on his own and we need to replace that position. We need someone to drive sales in that territory; but, he does not have much drive and sales are not doing so well in that area and we feel that if we had a candidate with more drive it would be better. It has always been that way. He has been with us for seven years. It has been addressed with him mostly verbally. It would normally be going through the manager. We do not do performance evaluations; if it does it happens with the managers. What if we are willing to give a severance agreement?	
1	We are doing a layoff and we want to pay them two weeks severance can we do this on the 6th day? We are in Texas.

4	Employee who we called to terminate on Saturday. The had a conversation with the owner on Wednesday, this escalated into a screaming match. We gave her some days to calm down. We called her terminate her position on Saturday. We called her Saturday to tell her to terminate her. She said she was going on disability if we terminate her. She's asking for $100000 in severance.	
3	They are looking to term an employee who lives in New Jersey they want to know the law around that . When do they need to cover insurance until? And also the final pay.	
3	We have a situation of a union member that is making an inquiry of potential discrimination. Background-Member has a cancer diagnosis and has been receiving chemo treatment weekly (Thursday) and is taking off each week. He returns to work most Fridays-not all. In the past the employer/contractor told this person it was "ok". Now the employer is terminating employment due to too much time away from work. The negotiated labor agreement states the following:"the Union and the Contractor should not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, creed, or color, sex, national origin, or age or disability." the member is not collecting any form of disability benefits, but is asking can they terminate or lay him off based on this medical condition and missing every Thursday? The contractor is stating he is being laid off due to too much time off of work.	
5	An employee went on leave in May. He actually walked off the job stating he wasn't going to die here. I believe he had health issues he needed to address. I had a manager contact him and offer leave of absence. In August he attempted to return. I let him know we needed a release from the doctor but he never showed up. Now I'm cleaning up my records and realized he shows active. Should I process as involuntary termination? I know he has filed for UI but feel this was a job abandonment.	
5	We want to terminate an employee who works in the state of California. He called off all of last week with not notice. We allowed him to use vacation. His manager heard from him that he is looking for another job. He called off yesterday too, saying he will not be in all week. He has access to patient information so we have concerns about risks tied to privacy and employee information. How do we handle his final paycheck?	
1	If an employee has let us know that they want to resign and have us notice. If we decide to tender their resignation early do we have to pay them through the notice date?	
1	We want to terminate an employee today we just discovered that we have to pay out terminated employees same day. If we tell him today that his check will be to him on the 21st is that okay?	
1	An employee gives two week's notice which we accept. We then decide after 1 week, that employee that who has given notice is doing more harm than good in the workplace and we let them go. Do we need to pay them for the week of notice that we didn't let them work out? Can they file a successful unemployment claim?	
4	We have an employee who filled out FMLA paperwork. She is going on maternity leave - the week she was going out, we found member fraud. We notified her of the investigation and she was oblivious, totally oblivious. We would like to terminate her but are concerned because of the FMLA. We have tapes which shows no person standing in front of her when the withdrawals were made. She denied everything. I am concerned because payment will stop when we terminate her. If we had the proof, could we terminate her? The missing money is balanced in between audits.	
1	A client has asked ... . If someone gives a two week notice but we might want to let them go before then do we need to pay them through the two week notice?

1	NY employee has been coming in late, no show/no call, a lot. Ops manager has been talking to him. We are at the point we just want to let him go. Is there a rule for how many times someone can no call/no show before they are terminated?	
4	We had an employee that walked out in the middle of her shift last Thursday and tried to come in on Friday. Is that considered job abandonment? And how do I pay her? When she came in Friday, we had considered her actions from the day before to have been job abandonment.	
4	With Kirsten Medvedich: An employee had issues before where alcoholism was hindering productivity. She received treatment and she was sent home today - she reeked. The president would like to terminate her. She was sent home. 2 months ago I told her if she showed up to work intoxicated, she would lose her job. She met with the CMO, who smelled alcohol. She stated her last drink was 3am and was sent home and told to call her sponsor and consider treatment. She put together the holiday party - at the party, she was so altered it was noticeable and admitted to taking a marijuana edible. The hotel staff came to us and said something was wrong with the employee (before the party). The idea is to have her with the company through January 1, so she has benefits through the end of January. How can we be compassionate without increasing liability? What about if we gave severance and paid a first month's COBRA? She has already said "they can't fire me because I am disability." If she calls me and states she need to take a leave? She knew she would be terminated if she came back to work intoxicated.	
5	We just parted ways with an employee who worked for us full time with a W-2. He owns an S corp, I wasn't sure if that will effect his filing for unemployment?	
5	I have an employee who is currently on vacation. There has been an issue that has arisen where we want to terminate him now. If we do this, would we have to pay for his vacation that he is currently on and was approved?	
5	An employee doesn't feel I can pay him enough to keep him with the company. As a result he is going to be leaving us, because we cannot agree. I am not laying him off and I am not firing him, he is resigning, in my estimation. We are negotiating his final date. I have an email that says he needs more compensation and he needs to look for different employment. He is making the decision to leave. I am writing the response email now. If he is not resigning until he finds another job and I am looking for someone to fill his job, if I find somebody and stipulate the job end date, unemployment? Should I try to get to him to come up with date?	
3	Hello. I am the President and CEO of a nonprofit organization and unfortunately, due to budget constraints, had to eliminate the positions of two employees. I presented both employees with a letter stating that they would be paid out for their vacation, offered to let them work until the end of the year, stated I would not contest unemployment benefits, and gave them each a bonus. Neither was due to performance both are great employees. The employee in question, has been with HEAR Wisconsin for 12 years and is the Director of our Therapy Services program. HEAR Wisconsin does not offer severance there is nothing noted in our handbook so I offered her a bonus of $5,000 due to her tenure with our organization. She has hired an attorney who presented me with a letter stating the employee wants $15,000 and to have her (and her children's) insurance paid for 2 months. I know Wisconsin is an at will state, but are there any requirements as an employer that I have to follow?	
4	Farm new employee started 12.5 with 8# per hour standard; she is not up to par. She knows that not meeting the standards for productivity is grounds for termination due to the loss of revenues. Just checking in for any concerns.	
1	We have an employee with performance issues. She recently left a classroom full of students unattended and we have video and eye-witness documentation. We are concerned that she will throw unrelated medical issues into the mix. Can we terminate?	
3	Can a temp employee working for a contracting company be terminated knowing she was pregnant?	
5	Employer has a situation with an employee who he wants to terminate.	
5	I was looking for another opinion. What are your thoughts on a company requiring an investor to give access to his own laptop that he purchased and belongs to him the the relationship ends?	
3	Email from a client: They have a VEC unemployment call Wednesday and they're saying the employee made statements on several occasions that the doctor made racial comments and did not like the employee. They are going concerned this will come up during the UI hearing. I need to guide them regarding how to proceed between now and Wednesday. They want to know how to respond if it comes up? What if they didn't investigate the former employee's claims? What if she was terminated for performance or not following a policy, they just stick to those facts? If she is alleging retaliation, they just have to be able to show what is really for?	
1	Employee resigned and provided a 5-day notice; however, we would prefer she just leave now. Can we do that without causing an involuntary termination?	
1	We let someone go a few weeks ago. We offered a separation agreement. Do I need to notify EDD on the notice of claim files that we will be paying her this amount?	
4	with Hugo on phone. An employee had been written up 4x for performance. She has been given her final warning and is now at the point of termination. She is scheduled to go out on medical leave (SDI) this Wed. May we terminate her employment due to her ongoing poor work performance?	
2	exit interview I need to do an exit interview. Is there any guidance or template that I can use? Thanks. Jennifer Bao Financial Controller Cell: 408-839-0556 jennifer@streamsets.com	
3	A client planned on terminating for several reasons the meeting did not happen last Friday, today he filed a workers' comp. Can they still move on with the termination as long as they can support it's unrelated to his supposed injury?	
3	I received an UI claim. There is not a choice for RIF. There is one selection for lack of work.	
5	We had an employee give notice verbally at the end of Jan. His last day was to have been 2/28. He had an altercation with one of the doctors at the hospital in front of other doctors which became very heated. He yelled and scream obscenities at our doctor/owner. Then on the 2/9 he came in with a note from his doctor taking him off work through April. DO we have to continue employing him?	
2	Drafting a severance letter, over the age of 40. I know they need 21 days to review, and 7 days to revoke. Can you help me with the language for the agreement? I am presenting this letter to the employee today.	
0	We in an offer letter offered an employee 5 days of vacation pay in 2016 after a probationary period. In 2017 the employee was to have 10 days to PTO plus holidays. Do we owe her the 5 days to untaken vacation from 2016 since she has terminated her employment with us?	
2	I need handouts for termination in the state of TX	
5	We have an employee who has given notice. Prior to give his notice he requested to work remotely has he and his wife were moving to FL. We have a practice of allowing employee to work remotely and we currently have employees working in SC, OH and KY. This employee is male over 30, African American, and former military. His request to telecommute was denied by his supervisor and he was told that this policy was being done away and that those people who telecommuted where being laid off. He then reviewed our handbook to discover that we did not have an actual telecommuting policy in place. I as the new HR person (only been here 11 weeks) am in the process of creating a very stringent telecommuting policy with the help of SHRM which would not allow for full time out of state telecommuting policy but we are not laying off those people who work out of state. With the new policy people who telecommute would be required to come into the office 2-3 days per week. Additionally this employee stated that he did not know why he was not give the chance to telecommute when he as a salaried non-exempt employee often worked over 40 hours and never asked to be paid overtime.	
4	Employee was given offer, she filled out paperwork, set her up for time clock showed her around. She was here 2.5 hours. A week later, she resigned. Do we have to pay her as an employee?	
4	We hired too many people. The person that I don't want to have anymore is the second to the lat person hired - the last person hired has less issues and is more flexible. She is always asking for more hours. How do I handle this? She's not as flexible - she doesn't want to work both weekend days. But it is not due to childcare or anything. She calls in sick a lot (for as much as she wants additional hours). She offers to cover someone's shift then calls off. (Running a fever, too tired, cold, etc.). She also likes to leave early a lot.	
2	Would you send me a sample severance agreement?	
3	If we are terminating someone in our payroll system, if they are a sales employee, is there an issue with us terminating him and then still issuing commission checks after his termination date?	
3	If an employee quits, what is the minimum amount of hours that has to be paid to them?	
2	When you transfer a business unit to another company, is the termination considered involuntary?	
2	I'm looking for a termination letter. We are purchasing a company and taking over so I just need a template that the current employer can use.	
0	An employee has been with us for less than 90 days. He is leaving. Must we pay out his accrued vacation and sick?	
1	We are considering laying off 2 employees. We are a machine shop and currently working 32 hours per week instead of 40 hours per week. In order to get the majority of shop employees back to working a 40 hour week, we are looking at laying off one machinist and one material handler. We have only 2 material handlers. One material handler is on modified work due to a workers' comp injury. We have been complying with her doctor's restrictions. Management would like to layoff the material handler who is on modified duty. Our other material handler is capable of working without any restrictions. Also, we are a union shop and our material handler with restrictions has more seniority than our other material handler. It makes more sense for our business to layoff our restricted employee. What kind of ramifications are we facing?	
2	How many days of an employee not showing up for work do you have to wait before terminating an employee in California? How about for North Carolina?	
3	Melody 916-472-8076 melody@yosisamra.com Is it okay to let a person go due to budgetary reasons with no notice?	
5	I have an employee working in Reno, NV that express his desire of retiring at the beginning of this year. We put someone to shadow him to be prepared for his retirement, but now he hasn't given a specific time to depart from the company. His supervisor spoke to him last week to find the date for it but he did not say. Can i cut his working hours for a Part time job until he decide? What can i do?	
5	We have a relatively new hire that has been reprimanded twice now for arriving late, and sleeping at his desk. Today the employee "texted" his manager 15 minutes before his shift, stating he would be absent today. This is not proper call in procedures. May we process termination?	
6	Caller Jeremy. Phone: 647.622.7909 We are processing a termination and have questions on when we can receive the check from JustWorks.	
1	We have a question about an employee that we want to let go. We have established a 30 day notice period where the employer/employee must provide 30 days notice before separation. The General Manager has a sales person who is not making their target. We would generally want to put the employee on a PIP, but we have actually lost clients because of him, so the GM wants to terminate now. If we do so, however, would we not need to pay him through the 30 day notice period?	
4	We have an employee who has had communication, unacceptable behavior, and poor performance. She has been talked to on a few occasions, and the supervisor has made notes about the conversations with her. We have a policy that clearly states that working overtime can only be done with the written approval of the CEO. This employee has worked substantial overtime in the last two weeks without the CEO's written approval. Can we terminate?	
1	It's regarding notifying employees about terminations. One manager doesn't want to let other employees know about terminations and I want to notify other employees about it. Just a simple, so and so is no longer with us. I would like to get your opinion regarding this.	
1	We are laying off 1 employee in our retail store in NY state. What documents are required?	
2	Disruptive and Angry Employee expressed to manager "why don't you just fire me?". Employer is prepared to do so at this point. Can you advise on final pay and conducting termination meeting?	
1	Erin Waters calling on behalf of Christina. We are laying off one employee based on a restructuring of our organization and the employee's inability to meet the job expectations up to this point. He is a 10 year employee, age 32. How should we manage? He works in Philadelphia, we are in DC.	
2	Question Regarding Standard Q&A for Layoffs Good Morning, I have a question regarding layoffs. Do you have a standard list of Q&As regarding layoffs? This is something that we would like to provide employees. If you had a couple of sets of questions. Q&A for employees who are affected by layoff due to the purchase of their company; Q&A for employees who are affect by layoff due to the reorganization of the company; Q&A to includes transition issues such as Cobra, severance, etc. (we can fill in the exact details but we are looking for general Q&A that are standard issues) Any assistance would be appreciated. Thank you, Greg Feller HR Director Altura Communication Solutions 1335 South Acacia Avenue Fullerton CA 92831 O: 714.948.8616 F: 714.948.8639 gfeller@alturacs.com www.alturacs.com [cid:image001.jpg@01D064FC.433B4B80]	
5	We have a client that has an employee that just stopped coming to work. He worked up to 18th of January and called in sick and has not returned to work. When they reached out to him he sent a text thanking them for the job. Do they need to continue his benefits? Can they terminate him?	
5	I have received a formal request from a terminated employee who wants to know more precisely why he was terminated. I have 45 days from his request date to give him the information, however, how much information do I have to give this previous employee. Can I make it to the point or do I need to provide details including information off of the disciplinary forms he himself has signed. Do I need to put every single detail that the supervisor has written down?	
1	Following up on the response I got regarding the situation. I want to make sure I understand the advice about getting written statements from other employees first. This would take some time and I would rather the employee not come back to work until we have a decision. Should I put him on a paid leave?	
4	This question is related to releasing an employee who has been working less than 90 days who isn't working out in one of our show rooms. She isn't connecting with our customers, they ask to work with someone else, she is bringing her personal problems to work, she seems unfocused and isn't focused on teamwork. Bottom line, it isn't working out. Would the proper terminology be a layoff or a termination? Also, what would our risk of termination be?	
4	I have an employee who has been here for 7 months and we put her on a performance plan. We gave her items to work on. We have a doctor who is leaving and that means that there will not be a need for her role any longer. Is it not recommended to proceed with a layoff because she was already on a performance plan?	
5	This is a follow up to an ongoing matter we have discussed with the live team. This employee did request leave to attend a drug rehabilitation program, and is now currently granted accommodations to attend his therapy. The employee has not furnished documentation relating to the leave, despite us offering the necessary paperwork. The employee did use vacation time to cover the short-term leave. In an unrelated matter, the employee called in today stating they would arrive late to their shift, as he was taking his spouse to the doctor. The employee did not report at the promised time and it was later discovered (upon us contacting him), that he need more time off as his spouse was going to jail. May we fire him?	
4	We have a new employee who is in her 90 day introductory period. She is okay technically, but she isn't meeting expectation in regards to interactions, behaviors, communication, etc. Can we let her go with no repercussions of wrongful termination?	
3	Hello - I have a small group who currently has an employee out on disability due to an injury that happened off the job seven months ago. His LTD picked up begin of this month and the employee states he intends to stay out 'as long as possible to prevent re-injury'. The group is coming to a point where they need to fill his position pretty soon if he does not intend to return to work. At this in time, what stage is the group at to where they can terminate him without legal ramifications, or what should be communicated to this employee at this time? The group is less than 50 employees. I think they have around 35 to 40 employees. So FMLA is not an option, correct? Thank you in advance for your response.	
2	Can you please provide the severance information we discussed earlier as well as sample forms? Also if we were to terminate an employee would we use the term laid off or terminated?	
3	Certainly the lead may send the employee home if they are being disruptive to the other employees nothing limits this. Its best to evaluate the facts and circumstances to ensure this warrants this type of disciplinary action.	
0	Hi, In California, do we have to pay the wages and unused vacation hours to the employee on the day of termination? Or are we allowed certain hours like 24 hours or 72 hours until we pay to the employee? We are planning to terminate an employee anytime soon, but we wanted to make sure on this first. Thank you, Yuko Anderson	
1	We are downsizing a position of software tester in Denver, CO because we will have those jobs be only in Scottsdale, AZ. Do we have to offer this person a transfer before the lay off? Or can we lay off the person and allow them to apply for the position in Arizona on their own?	
4	we are going to reduce a employees hours from FT to PT. Can she claim unemployment insurance? Also, we want to continue you to offer her health insurance even though she will not be full time anymore.	
6	Washington DC final pay for sign on bonuses. Can you recoup if the requirements (tenure) from final pay?	
4	Unemployment. We have a staffing company doing payroll. We want to do it in house instead of having a payroll company. EDD unemployment. What direction should I go in this? What is involved with the EDD. All the basics that I should know? I have a client who goes through a payroll service, who is the employer of record. She's looking at her options. We're looking at workers' comp, taxes, and EDD. She was concerned about registration and requirements. If you have too many using the EDD service, does she get penalized? When she's looking at everything as far as reporting, do they look every two years for the UI rate? Is the employee taxes to the Franchise Tax Board (FTB) paid quarterly? How often is PIT paid? How do I log into Comply? I think she is going to do Quicken.	
5	Dec 19,2017 07:50:59 Good Morning,I believe this was sent to me in error as I did not ask this question. Dec 19,2017 07:21:59 Employee was got stealing and we are planning to terminate him. The president saw him take $600 cash from a customer. When she questioned the employee about where he put the cash, he claimed the customer paid by credit card. There was no record of the credit card transaction or any transaction, so we sent the employee home and told him we needed to investigate. We called the customer who stated they did indeed pay in cash. We contacted the police and will file a report. On Friday, we contacted the employee about coming in and he said he didn't have transportation as his girlfriend was using his car. We told him we would talk with him on Monday. On Monday, he called in stating he was in the ER with pneumonia and couldn't come in. We asked him to send us his statement, so he sent an email with the same story he told the president. I want to know how to process the termination if he does not show up back at work?

1	We are planning on terminating an employee today and he called in sick. Can we do it over the phone?	
3	One of our clients, Martin Fluid Power, hired an employee but when filling out the benefits paperwork noted their information did not match up with their new hire information (SSN). The employee subsequently quit. They need to issue the check for the time the employee was there. Are they required to report this discrepancy to anyone?	
3	If I have an employee that resigned, is there any form I can have them sign so they don't come back for any law suits? Voluntary resignation separation forms?	
5	Submitted by Dave - General Manager Hello, we are a small Manufacturing Company in Mass and our question is, an employee shows up and clocks in for work when I notice the smell of pot with glossy eyes and slurred speech, I question the employee if he had just smoked and he said no but last night he did. The employee has a job that would most certainly cause harm if someone was under the influence and I believe this is not the first time although it is the first I can prove it, but also I do not believe it will end. Are we justified in terminating this persons employment legally? Dave Gray/GM Graycer Screw Products

1	We have a new associate that was hired the last day of Oct and we have a three month introductory period. She does not appear to be a good fit. It is not job performance. What should I put on my separation notice?	
1	We manage a location in Reno with 7 employees. We have an employee who worked 12/7 and 12/8, and has not been heard from since. We do not want to retain this person, what should we do? Three day no-call, no-show policy.	
3	We have a client who is questioning if there are discrimination rules for terminating employees as it relates to discrimination testing. In other words, does a company have to be consistent in the severance packages for a terminated employee, whether it be by benefit class, tenure with the company etc.	
4	Employee was placed on final written warning in July due to excessive absenteeism improved for awhile now she is missing work again; she called two weeks ago and stated she had to go to Mexico to take care of her father. We have no leave allowance for this and want to terminate her employment. She stated her back hurt about a month ago but could tell us if it was work related and didn't want medical care through our WC. We just want to be sure that we don't have any legal issues.	
3	We do not provide the reason why an employee is terminated during the termination meeting. We just notify them that they are no longer an employee at InterConnect Wiring. Is there an issue compliance wise with providing the termination reason during the meeting? Some people assume they are being terminated for a reason that isn't accurate and I feel like that could cause more issues because they could think they are being discriminated against when the reason is based on their attendance and not their race. What is recommended?	
0	(With Fran): We are a MA S-Corp with Admin offices in MA and a manufacturing/assembly facility in NH. Due to a lack of work, we need to layoff one of the NH employees. Please advise how we can best determine what is required of us in terms of wages and entitlement payout. We just didn't know if vacation would need to be paid out? We do not think the policy addresses it. We had one employee who went part-time due to disability and the vacation accrual was paid out. He is on vacation the week of the 25th through the 29th. Employment would end the 22nd. Is a reference required?	
5	We have an employee in one of our remote offices that we have a problem with. If an account is stale, it is up for grabs. When the employee was out, someone else booked a load with the account and he is upset, having a hard time letting it go. The employee approached the coworker asked when the client sent an email and the coworker responded "I don't know what you are talking about" and the manager had to step in between the two and said if this is about what I think it is, speak with your manager and go sit down. The employee stepped closer to the manager and broadened his chest. The employee refused to leave until he saw the emails. The manager felt threatened and went to the GM. They want to terminate the employee. Unrelated, the employee was out for two weeks due to medical issues but wasn't communicating well - not calling to mid-morning and he was written up for poor communication and for not listening to his managers regarding the stale account - he kept communicating the client - he sent the email anyway. Management wants to terminate him. This happened today. It is very tense in there now. My concern is that it is based on interpretation that he was being threatening. But, it sounds like insubordination. Should I have an investigation? I told the manager to call me if anything else happens. We do not have a reason to believe it would escalate, since he saw the emails.	
2	In PA, must we notify employees in writing as to the reason for termination?	
6	California final pay for deceased employee; what are the procedures? Beneficiary for life insurance is his sister.	
3	What are the implications for an employee on maternity leave if an office in CA permanently closes, causing the layoff or transfer (if available) of employees? Is there something in the WARN Act or otherwise indicating how this employee can remain receiving their maternity pay following their severance with the company? Could this be paid out in total ahead of time? Or would there severance with the company be delayed until after their maternity ends? Thank you for any clarification on this.	
3	An employee (California) did not show up for work or communicate with employer for three days. Employer called and left voice messages AND text employee as well. Question 1 - what is employer's responsibility for paying employee? (how, when, etc.) Note: employee normally got auto deposit - does that make a difference? Question 2 - employee has reimburseables due to him - what is employer's responsibility for paying - how long do they have to pay the employee? Does employee need to pick up check or does it need to be mailed to him. Normal procedure was for employee to pick up in office. Thank you	
3	Employee agrees to retire from company and terminate employment. Retirement confidentiality agreement 8 weeks of vacation This is not how we typically handle things and I'm not sure about it, and I'd like to discuss the situation.	
1	An employee gave us 1 month resignation notice. We found someone new. Can we just let the employee go?	
2	Do you have an exit interview template?	
4	We have an employee who has provided a resignation date of 12/29. She's stating that she'd like to change that date to January 2nd. If we hold her to that original date, would it be a involuntary termination.	
1	We are eliminating a position January 1st, and the employee is now not showing up to work at this point. It's not working for anyone involved. We'd like to pay her through the 31st but go ahead and terminate now. What day would we use as the termination date?

2	Are you required by law to provide termination paperwork as for why an employee is terminated to the employee?	
5	An employee submitted his two weeks' notice on Saturday, 12/16, due to his schedule. We have asked to meet with him to see what his schedule preferences are in case we may be able to work something out with him. Since submitting his notice, we've received complaints that he is speaking negatively about the company and making inappropriate remarks. He has also said that it's ok if he gets fired, he'll just file for unemployment. We would like to let him work through this Friday and then tell him at the end of the day that he doesn't need to work out the rest of his notice and that day is his last. Does this change his termination from voluntary to involuntary since we aren't allowing him to finish out his two weeks? We would like to avoid unemployment payments, so how can we shorten his two week notice in a compliant way with it still being voluntary?	
5	Not sure if this is the write place to ask but...we have an employee who was terminated and we paid him his last check. He said he never received it, but we show that it has been cashed. Are we, the employer, required to investigate this? Or does he need to prove to us that someone else cashed it and deal with his bank? Thanks!

She was on light duty and being released to full duty tomorrow. She is emailing and seems like she is keeping good track of everything. How can I get rid of her before her 90 days without being caught up in anything?	
3	If an organization runs out of money, and they are contractually obligated to offer severance. Who is supposed to pay that severance? What if the company goes into bankruptcy? Would the company still be obligated to pay the severance payment?	
5	We just terminated an employee after concluding an investigation about making a threatening physical gesture to his manager. We told him he was fired for unprofessional behavior but not specifically because of the gesture. He now wants to speak with anyone who will listen at the company and is demanding more reason. Are we obligated to give this?	
6	An employee has given 2 days notice of resignation. He indicated that Friday, 12/22 will be his last day. Can we let him go today? The employee received a loan from us and signed a 2 year agreement. We have been deducting a fixed amount from each paycheck as part of this agreement. The agreement also indicates that if the employee leaves before the balance is paid off, we may recoup the balance or hold his final wages. May we do that?	
6	NY employee is leaving on 12/31, and we are preparing her final paycheck. She has outstanding company credit card balance and has not paid it despite multiple reminders.

5	Follow up regarding sexual harassment investigation of the temporary employee who was making inappropriate comments about how ladies needed to be at home instead of working, how woman were treated back in the days, what were woman's responsibilities, who needed to do laundry etc. We completed the investigation and decided to terminate his contract, due to sexual harassment. We notified him we are terminating him on Friday. His reaction was he wanted to see what he is being accused of. He wants to see the investigation notes. He got angry and states he can make these comments due to his culture - women should be home doing laundry. We did have a conversation with him about that but did not tell him who complained. He went back out to his work area and started saying things and accusing others. Now the girl who filed the complaint is scared and saying she wont be coming back to work.	
4	I have an employee whose last day is Friday. She is anticipated to work longer than usual - how do I get her final check to her?	
1	If we planned on terminating an employee and now we found out they may need FMLA in the future can we proceed?	
6	We have a technician passed away last night and his mother is calling about his pay. The Pennsylvania rules regarding final pay states payment should to go to spouse, children, then parent in that order. There is no spouse, and the son was in jail (not sure if he is now). Can we provide this to the mother?	
4	We have a part-time courier that was hired 07/12/2017. This employee is still in her Orientation Period. She has had multiple absences due to her pregnancy....75% of these were unscheduled! Our courier department is very critical to our operations so we are wondering if we have any recourse as far as termination for this employee. We realize that there are laws protecting pregnant women so we really need some clarifications. If her only issue is her absences and all her absences are basically pregnancy related, then does that mean we have no legitimate reason for termination? She did have a day where she did not show up for work or call to say that she wasn't coming in, but later we found out later that day her father had committed suicide. We get that this employee is having a rough time and we really do feel for her and we are trying to be as accommodating as we can, but at the same time, we have a department to run that is critical to our operations. If this had been a non-pregnant employee, they would have been terminated for violation of our Dependability Policy for excessive unscheduled absences. Does the fact that this employee is in her Orientation period give us any leverage? This employee is not due until May 2018, so we are expecting more of the same in the future months as the pregnancy develops as it seems to be a difficult pregnancy.

3	If an employee has given a two week notice and is failing to follow job responsibilities and company rules, is it safe to terminate the relationship before the completion of the two weeks and avoid them being able to claim they were terminated and collect unemployment?	
1	The president of our company recently passed away in a accident. His Brother has stepped in and is in control of the company. We have a employee on maternity leave now that we would like to lay off. Can we legally do this without repercussions? The employee has had no written or verbal warnings.

6	Hi Erin--I'm not sure if you get this email reply, but I have one follow up question. Can I make it a condition of receiving Severance Pay (not his last paycheck for work actually performed) that we get back his keys and computer password before we release the check? Thanks. Andrea	
4	If employees miss more than 15 days a year, they are subject to termination. The employer has an employee who missed 10 days and then brought another note. She is pregnant. She is saying she has the flu but now she might have pneumonia. I am not sure if they are FMLA covered.	
3	I have a small group located in VA that has an employee that has not worked full time for 6 to 7 months. Due to medical issues the group allowed him to work from home a few days a week but the employee's performance has drastically dropped. This employee also checked into a mental institution for evaluation and was admitted for 3 to 4 days. the employee has used up all of his sick time. The employer wants to terminate the employee but would like to know the proper procedure.	
6	I've got an employee who was on a LOA and submitted their resignation today. Our office is closed Friday and Monday - what is the 72 hours? Can we mail the check?	
5	We only have STD for hourly workers - he exhausted it a week ago. Moving to SSI and he has said he is disabled and may not work again. Do you have a form letter?	
4	Prolog Ventures is a small company with 2 employees and 3 partners / owners. We have had performance issue with our Staff Accountant during 2017 after she returned in February from 12 weeks of maternity leave. At first it was a few errors, mistakes, and forgetting tasks that were pointed out to her verbally, but by October we had to sit her down to discuss her poor performance and gave her a written notice of improvement needed. Her performance has improved some since Oct but at this point we are ready to terminate her. We want to make sure that she is not in a protected class and if there are any other concerns that we should be aware while we investigating this option.	
4	My payroll/hr person decided to leave on Monday. She gave me notice through the 27th. She wanted to use up PTO and get the holiday. I decided to take the resignation immediately and asked her to leave. At that point she started threatening saying she has to be paid through the 27th and all her PTO must be paid.

4	Hello, We have a client with an employee that is having gallbladder issues. It has gone on for some time and now she has been out of work completely for 3 weeks. I have posted the comment below from the group. Can you please advise on what their options are as far as fmla and termination? My question revolves around how much time we should allow for her to work this out. As you will be able to see in the document Her work history and performance has been poor, and she has not worked at all in the last three weeks. Im wanting to set a deadline for her to get her health issues resolved or her employment would end. Our perspective is that we have done everything to enable her to get this taken care of through our benevolence. Now it has moved to point that we feel we are being taken advantage of.	
0	I was wondering about payout for unused vacation in various states when an employee separates from the company.	
1	An employee put in a written notice of resignation date for January 4th. We are considering letting her go tomorrow. Can we do that? Would she still be able to file a claim of unemployment?	
2	If an employee resigns immediately, am I required to provide certain information or documents?	
4	An employee said she would resign immediately and then came back and said she wanted to resign 1/1 (she is not on our health plans). We wanted to make her resignation date on 12/29 and provide direct deposit final pay on that day. Is that okay?	
5	An employee essentially walked out - he was upset with his bonus amount (we heard). His supervisor was busy, and he simply clocked and left. I called and he wasn't there (home). He hasn't returned the call. His supervisor went to the clean room and they indicated they were discussing their bonuses and he was a rehire with absences and was a hot head. I am debating whether this is a voluntary resignation or termination. He needed to notify someone - he is a lead and today was critical day (first day of the compressed/split shift). He is setting an example. He did not check in with anyone. We do not want anyone to expect that they can just walk off and then keep their job, without any extenuating circumstances that would cause it.	
3	Client: Hub 5 A bartender was on video stealing from them . They want to terminate and deduct the money that was stolen. Can they do that?

Taking too many days off. She is pregnant and we are not firing her because of that. Do we have cause to fire with out a third write up? There have been many issues not written up? We are planning on terminating on the 26th? What if she does not sign the third write up? Do we need to document? What ground do we have? Do we have to offer the third or can we just terminate?	
4	I have an employee who needs to terminate an employee today. Our GM is out. This young lady tested positive on her drug test and we would like to terminate her immediately. She had hurt her back so we asked her to provide a release from her doctor to return. She did and it stated no restrictions. We then sent her to our doctor who said she was not fit to work. Our doctor drug tested and it tested positive for marijuana.	
2	Terminating an employee who is no call no show and tardy; termination letter?	
4	What statues speak to the ability to draw unemployment from a church organization. Employee is trying to draw from the state of Oregon. She used to live in Oregon and then came to join the company in Missouri. After being involuntarily terminated, she filed a claim under Oregon, but not under Missouri and we are contesting Oregon.	
4	We terminated an employee but realized afterwards that we had failed to pay her 2.5 hours of vacation. This vacation accrued during her last week of employment but was not calculated on her final check. She's saying we owe her the 2.5 hours plus wages for 30 days. Is that correct?	
6	Payroll Deductions Question - Group Size 58 - Texas Group Medical Policy Please see below email (PHI information X'd out) from one of our clients. I think I remember seeing some guidance from ThinkHR that indicates that it is against the law for an employer to try to recoup health/dental/vision insurance payroll deductions after the final paycheck or double up on those deductions on the final paycheck in an attempt to mitigate their loss due to the coverage extending through the end of the month. Please advise, using below email as an example. In the below example, the employee's last day of employment was 12-1-17, requiring his termination date with all carriers to be 12-31-17. Thanks!

5	We have an employee who last worked 11/24. Up until a week ago he was calling in for his shifts. He was texting the two managers. He doesn't qualify for FMLA. He has worked for 6 months. He brought in a doctors note 11/27 that he was seen for an illness. Then he brought in another 12/5 stating he is able to return 12/7 but has mobility issues and needs a walker and has trouble bending. For the last week he stopped calling. We have attempted to call him and he has not responded to any of our phone calls. No one has heard from him and the last communication from him was 12/17. The manager responded saying he must contact the HR manager and gave him HR's number. I've since called multiple times and finally today left a message if we don't hear back we would consider he has voluntarily terminated.	
3	Wow that was quick! Thanks! One follow-up question, what if it were just dental and vision that we were talking about. Those are not subject to SB51, but the contracts are set up with those carriers to cover the employee to the end of the month in which the employee is terminated. Would the answer be the same as below? Thanks!

4	We have an ex employee who recently left a couple weeks ago (voluntarily resigned on 11.29) that prior to leaving I felt she was trying to build her case. She is sending threatening texts. She no longer has a valid license to cut hair. We offered for her to get proper license and offered to pay for her to take the test. She chose not to take the classes. She quit in the middle of a shift after a customer complained about her service. Now she is asking for reimbursement for the test. She is no longer employed.

4	A few months back, we terminated an HR coordinator who had only been with the company for a month. The reasons for termination stemmed from breach of confidential employee compensation information. We have a statement from the employee whom she made the comments to. At the time of termination, we did not go into detail as to why she was terminated. Only letting her know that her services were no longer needed. She has since attempted to contact multiple employees at the company to get more detail as to why she was terminated. She has now notified the owner that she is having documents drawn up and that he will receive notice soon. What other proactive steps (other than gathering our documentation) can we take to ensure the company is protected? Is the company protected just by this documentation alone?	
4	I have an employee (billing clerk) who is not performing at a high level. She has received a verbal and written warning and is on a performance improvement plan. I do not feel based on her past performance that she will be successful moving forward and will eventually be terminated. I have several questions that I would like to pose in lieu of terminating her: Can she quit and receive unemployment (WI) if I did not contest her applying for it or does her voluntarily quitting make her ineligible to receive unemployment benefits? If I eliminate her position I cannot rehire a full-time billing clerk for a year correct? Can I outsource her position to a temp service or is that the same as replacing her if her position is eliminated? I was trying to avoid terminating her if possible for her sake. Perhaps that isn't an option? Thank you for your help. I appreciate it.	
4	Termination of an employee. I have never done this before. The employee has 170 hours of unpaid time off and I had a conversation about this she with her last week. She is our receptionist. She was scheduled to be off Thursday and Friday and called in sick Tuesday. I know that back in July her father had stroke and she took 5 days and it was approved. The rest of the time it has been a day here an a day there. When she is here she is OK; however, when she is not someone else has to be pulled to do her work as she is our receptionist. What should I be considering?	
1	We have an employee we are sure is looking for another job - we received a VOE from a pre-employment agency. The manager wants to let him go is there any issue with that? The employee is at-will.	
2	What about severance agreements?	
3	We had an employee who left the country and I have a check here. I have not opened it so I don't know if it is a live check or not. I want to know how to proceed with. They ended their employment and this would be last check It was an emergency and she to leave.	
4	We have an employee who started working with us exactly 4 weeks ago as a Finance Assistant. We hired her through a recruiting firm for a full-time, hourly, non-exempt position. Occasionally, she has mentioned feeling that the work she is doing is not interesting. Today, she told a co-worker that she needs to make more money and has recently applied to 4 different companies. Since we know that she is looking for other employment, and she is approaching the 5-week mark at which point we'd be responsible for unemployment, can we use the fact that she has voiced her unhappiness with her duties, along with the fact that she said she is looking for other jobs, as a reason to terminate the employee? The employee is female in her 30's, & was originally from Russia, but has been a US citizen for over 5 years. I don't know if any of that matters because we have other employees who have the same demographic info. I want to make sure we're not subjecting ourselves to a legal situation.	
3	As far as an employee giving notice, is there a way an employer can change the separation date? How is that minimized to the company to minimize damage before the employee leaves?	
1	I currently have a Senior Accountant paid 83k and am interviewing a Junior Accountant at about 42k. The reason for this is I do not need the Senior Acct. level of responsibilities and need to reduce the overhead cost. My question is, can I let the Senior Acct. go or do I need to offer her the position of a Junior Acct? She is in a protected class.	
1	We have an employee we want to push into early retirement. We don't want to give her a severance package, but want to give her something. We are considering keeping her on benefits for 6 months. Is that the same thing as severance?	
3	If an employee resigned after a lay off announcement was made, are they still entitled to a severance?	
6	In California an employee that resigns from their position must have their final paycheck postmarked within 72 hours. My question is if weekends apply to the 72 hours or if it is only business days? Please advise. Thank you, Michele	
3	One of our owners laid off an employee (Receptionist) who has been employed a few weeks and will be hiring an internal person. Could this pose a problem.	
1	We are looking at laying off 2 employees in Colorado. Are there any specific rules in that state related to layoffs?	
1	A teacher was witnessed by another teacher slapping the hands and pushing back one of our disabled children. We are going to terminate. Must we go through the full disciplinary action process first, by providing verbal warning before terminating?	
4	We are going to terminate a new employee for excessive absences & tardiness; however, we wanted to run it by your professionals. Her hire date was April 24th 2017.

2	What is the best practice in terminating someone with repeat write ups for performance and lacks a positive attitude?	
4	Friday, we had a meeting with an employee and she chose to sign a resignation letter. I gave her info on benefits. She emailed today and requested a copy of her personnel file and resignation letter. What do I have to give her from personnel file? What is the law?	
6	Via email: Hello, If an employee is being terminated, are we required to pay them their final pay and/or severance pay via a manual check? Or can it be paid through direct deposit? Thanks!	
4	I have an employee whose last day is this Friday. It's a voluntary termination. 1-Do I have to provide her with the state unemployment insurance packet? 2-she is going to come back 1 day next week just to cover for a meeting we have. I was going to pay her as a consultant because it's just for a few hours. Is that okay?	
3	Can we release someone during the "90 day probationary period" and not have his unemployment come from our unemployment insurance account?	
2	We are terminating an employee this week as we no longer have the need for this position and he is not qualified to fill any other job opening. Can you please provide me with the CA required termination documents? Must we provide 2 weeks pay in lieu of giving the employee 2 weeks advance notice?	
5	I have an employee who gave two week notice last Wednesday. Since then he hasn't worked for one day. He has only shown up for 1 hour this week. Nonexempt employee. Can we let them go early?	
0	For Minnesota, are employers required to pay accrued but unused PTO on termination? Our policy says we pay out except in cases where termination is a result of misconduct.	
6	Is an EE's final paycheck supposed to have the LDA as the check date? (and/or can an earlier date be issued on the check instead?)	
6	Would you be able to verify that a postmark date is sufficient and that we are not required to have the actual paycheck available to the employee within 72 hours? I spoke with someone at the CA Labor Commissioner's Office- hotline- and she said the employee should be able to receive the actual check within 72 hours. The employer should have the check readily available for the employee within 72 hours at the employer's facility. If the employee does not want to go to the employer's facility to pick up the check and requests it be mailed to their home address we then have 72 hours from their last day of work to have it postmarked to their address. Is the above information accurate? We were under the impression that the postmark date was sufficient. Also, if an employee provides advanced notice of their resignation we must pay them out on their last day of work. We use a pay check company that is not located in California. What will happen if the paycheck is postmarked within 24 hours from their last day worked?	
2	Can an employer choose the employees and for what reasons an employee will receive severance payments upon termination of employment? Please give information on how severance arrangements can be setup. And, can the employer either increase the taxable severance payment to pay for COBRA premiums for the employee or have COBRA premiums be nontaxable if the employer pays the COBRA premiums directly to the administrator. (LW notes)	
6	Good afternoon, We have an employee that maybe employee that may be terminated from the company shortly....he has an existing company loan - how much can we deduct from his last paycheck to try to recoup some of this $?	
4	if we currently have an open position we want to combine this position with another position. She has not been performing up to par and we have documented her performance. Can we lay her off?	
1	We have an employee who gave notice that Sunday will be her last day. We don't have anyone onsite that day, what are our options?	
4	We have an employee who came in Monday, called in sick Tuesday, had a doctor's appointment Wednesday and Thursday. She worked Thursday and then emailed her resignation effective immediately. She is related to another employee who recently quit. We have a policy that says the CEO and supervisor can ask for a doctor's excuse and that it is required if you are out three consecutive days but that we reserve the right to ask for one on other occassions. Our CEO sent an email to this individual requesting a doctor's note for the day that was pre-scheduled and she replied saying she was no longer an employee and did not have to comply. Can we withhold her pay for that day?

3	We provide medical and dental coverage for our employees with the stipulation that they do not file for unemployment during work slowdowns. In the event they do, they must re-enroll after 60 days if they are working a minimum of 30 hours per week. Is our company policy violating state or federal employment laws?	
1	Kathrin Kaehler kathrin@symbioticenteratinment.com Phone: 310-210-5194 The company closed down yesterday and I want to make sure we do the right thing for our employees in terms of applying unemployment. We did not issue a formal termination letter and we had employees in California and Washington. Is that something we needed to do? We terminated the relationship with JustWorks as of yesterday as well so I'm assuming they won't take care of it.	
4	510.759.5110 I want to speak to someone about a temporary employee issue. I hired our policy fellow that was only working 10 hours and they filled in when our executive assistant left. They were only doing admin duties not the full job. When she was a fellow she was submitting 9 or 8 hours in her log. I realized that when she worked 9 hours we needed to pay her for overtime. I asked her to go back to invoices so that we can pay you time and half and she did that and she went back to Nov when she was a fellow and not to January when she was temp. She got upset because she stated that I had asked her to go back and she quit she used the wrong form she used the fellowship for rather than temporary form. She stated that she has filed a claim with the labor board. I have already processed all her time sheets for the time and processed her time sheet and provided her final pay. I was late, by two day, paying her so I paid the two day waiting penalty as well.	
3	An employee gets fired for cause on 4/25 and the same day is deemed disabled by their doctor and files for STD. Should we consider the employee terminated and send COBRA information or should we assume the member is on FMLA and still employed? if so, how does the employer collect premium for the members benefits?	
3	We terminated an employee for violating one of our policies. I am starting to receive employment verification calls for this individual. What am I legally obligated to tell prospective employers. I prefer to only give employment dates..if they ask other questions, there is no issue with me declining to answer correct?

We moved him around a bit to try and find a good match to his skills but have not been successful. Can we just let him go without providing any reason? Should we have him sign a release of claims?

5	I'm looking to terminate an employee in their introductory period due to attendance issues. He submitted a note saying he was caring for his daughter's drug issues (rehab) then never showed again, among other violations such as no call.	
3	How long does an employer have to pay someone who worked for them after they are no longer an employee?	
5	We have an employee who is not working out and will no longer be working for us after this weekend. We have multiple options for why they will not work for us anymore and I want to know from an unemployment standpoint what would be the best approach. He used to be really flexible in his time to work for us and he recently changed it to only two days a week and I think we have the option to say we can't continue to employ him due to the limited schedule. Can he get unemployment then?	
5	We have an employee who has been with us about 5 months. This employee has been tardy several time over the last few months. We provided a verbal warning yesterday, and had another conversation today with another verbal warning. After the verbal warning yesterday, he went to his job site without saying anything. After our conversation today he went to the front of this truck, stared down at the wall at the wall for about two/three minutes straight before loading his truck; and then he very quickly loaded his truck. I made sure he loaded the truck safely but he went very fast.	
3	If we have an employee that goes with job abandonment and they have company equipment can we go after them by filing a claim?	
1	We are terminating an employee because her leave of absence ended. She's been on leave for two years. We want to provide her with courtesy severance pay but we do not want to call it severance pay, or separation pay. We would like to know if we can call it courtesy severance pay. We are under no contractual obligation to pay this employee severance pay.	
4	I have an employee who gave resignation for the 29th. She gets paid a regular wage per hour and also gets mileage reimbursement. What do we do with the mileage reimbursement if she will still be driving on that day? We can not estimate how much it will be since it depends on what the client will need her to do. Does she get holiday pay for the 1st if her last day is the 29th?	
3	One of our clients has been notified that one of their employees is going to be part of the Stanislaus County Sheriff's electronic monitoring program. Can they terminate him? They do not know what he did but they don't feel comfortable with him as an employee.	
5	I am helping a company that went through reviews. One employee needed improvement and the manager stated that the product is being discontinued and want to lay him off. He is clearly under performing (based on this and past reviews). 3 other people were moved to a new project and he told the employee he could not be moved because he does not work quickly. This gentleman is over 40. I know have to be cautious about that. They could give him a week's severance and have him consider the waiver. I think its better to give severance and a waiver of claims. He has been with the company since November 2014, so if we use the one week per year they give 3 weeks severance as a recommendation. Is this a layoff- is that the same as position elimination? Your advice is to say this is a position elimination layoff? If he were a performing employee he would be moved to another project but he's not? I should say its a layoff because the project is being terminated?	
1	Employee emailed us stating that his last day will be next Thursday. We would like to let him go today. Risks?

4	An employee works at one of our other offices. We told her we want her to move to this location because some of the doctors like how she does things. When she is here, she seems to stay off her phone and do what she is supposed to. When we did her review we told her the move was effective January 2. She emailed and requested an increase in pay before she decides to move. We do not feel this is appropriate because she has been written up. If we do not give her the raise she is requesting and she quits, can she get unemployment?	
4	Female Hispanic, over age 40, 5 years of service, Catering Director. Has failure in her leadership skills and event execution. She has been counseled in past, minimal documentation. Senior leadership would like to terminate. Can we discuss risks?

5	I have a situation where we found some paraphernalia on campus. We have random drug testing policy. Of the 4 names 2 came back positive for THC. We have drug free work policy. We had one of the gentlemen this was his 4th drug related incident and his numbers came in at 832. The second one it a truck driver. Options are to term them immediately. Give last chance option where they go to rehab then 3rd is suspend and re test in 30 days. If I suspend the one (832) can I do a re-test on the truck driver? He said he consumed a brownie at a party the week before. Would like to discuss. The MRO told me that 15 is a fail. Last time we termed an employee at 600, the MRO told me the user was daily. The nurse who did the testing told the individual he tested positive and he told me he consumed marijuana laced food, and that he had to have his wife drive him home. We are going to call him to get date of consumption, per the MRO so that we can retest to show it was a one-time thing. 363 is pretty high. For the other individual, this is a 4th incident. This is the first time we tested the 832 individual but we had 3 accusations where we were told he was distributing/selling marijuana on campus and there was a sexual harassment incident. We only allow for medical marijuana. The driver is CDL, not sure if federal DOT.

4	A long time employee was recently rehired. We have a rotating schedule program during the holidays. She requested an alternate schedule so she could spend time with her family. She has no PTO available. She doesn't want to comply and said she will "do what she will do." The manager wants to terminate based on this. Should we wait until there is a violation?	
4	New employee has had terrible attendance. Her first week of employment she was supposed to start on a Monday, called in sick, finally came in on Thursday, then called out again Friday. She worked for two weeks, then called out again this week. We are concerned how much to pay her - what about the 3 days of PSL, do I have to pay her those days as she has been out sick? Do I need to pay her for Christmas Day? How do I handle her final pay?

She is the kitchen manager at one of our child care centers so when she is out it puts a significant strain on the rest of the staff. She has been given written disciplinary notice in the past and will get another written notice next week. Are there any concerns with terminating her for this issue given her illness? Will she be eligible for unemployment if terminated for cause related to excess absences?

3	When looking to terminate an employee, are working notes enough documentation in order to support / justify the termination? I am concerned b/c this EE is in a protected class. I have had verbal discussions, but no documentation signed by the employee. I have a significant amount of notes I have taken over the last 8 months however.	
2	Is there a termination form template?	
4	Last month, we downsized employees at all 5 locations in NC and CA. The positions let go were varied and included Front Office staff, Ultrasound Techs, etc. Since then, we have brought back a few employees as full-time and some as part-time. At our Cary, NC location, we realize there is a need for a part-time Insurance Specialist needed. One specialist was let go in January and the managers would like to know if we should offer her the PT position first before posting. The reason the manager does not want to ask her is because they believe she would not accept the position and have some concerns because of the way she came in to drop off her things after the termination (threw everything on the desk). The manager is worried about the culture of the branch if she were to return. From an HR standpoint, we're worried if she sees the posting and asks why she wasn't asked first, could she potentially make a claim on the basis of gender/ race even if she signed a severance.

4	Employee went on maternity 10 months ago; she was not FMLA eligible. We gave her a position in another location. She didn't' show up for the role. Finally, we got a position in her home location. She and some others filed a grievance report - investigated and settled out fine. Then again, she filed another grievance against a male co-worker. The male co-worker showed evidence on how she was instigating the whole thing. The terms of agreement included that the male would avoid her, and we made sure they would not work the same shift. If anything happens let us know. This week she does a no call/no show. The manager decides to terminate at will. Now she and her husband are both calling me, wanting another position for her. I don't want to hire her, but am concerned about the grievance and whether she will call this retaliation. She asked the manager why she was being terminated and he said "I don't have to tell you".

She is combative, and argumentative and refuses to be accountable for her shortcomings in her performance. Last write up was Feb 2017. No improvement. Overall, written up 4x in last year and half. Just want to ensure no red flags. She is over 40, and so are several other employees on her team, and she is one of many females on the team. We are providing severance. Please advise.	
5	i have an employee with a wage garnishment and we started last week and his last day if Friday and he is leaving and there is going to be a severance. Can the garnishment come out of the severance?	
1	We are considering offering a severance package to someone we are terminating for cause. The employee's performance has been lacking and she not improved her performance over a period of years. Additionally she is chronically tardy for work. Is it counter-intuitive to provide a severance package to someone who you are terminating for cause?	
5	We are firing an employee with cause tomorrow. His manager wants to offer him 2 weeks severance pay upon termination with the following conditions. I'm not sure about items 2 and 3 listed below. Please let me know if they are legitimate or not. 1. Voluntarily yields all AM equipment and documentation in his possession, asked for or not 2. Remains available to answer questions within 24 hours, for the next 30 days 3. Any additional work over and above that will be billed at no more than $50/hr for the next 30 days 4. Signs a binding non-disclosure agreement prohibiting him from discussing the security or infrastructure of AM. He can discuss his work, but not the details.	
2	We are planning to eliminate the position (for valid business reasons) of an employee who is due to go out on FMLA-eligible maternity leave in July. Do you have any thought leadership you can provide me on when we should notify the employee? (Now? Sometime during the leave? When her leave expires?) My thought would be to do it sometime during her leave, after her short-term disability benefit period has ended. Thanks for any information you may be able to provide.	
3	Hello, This is a first for me in HR! Employee started work on 09/01/16. Claims he injured himself at work in November 2016 - first reports injury in Feb 2017. Menlo gives the DWC-1 form. Employee does not return the completed form but immediately hires a WC attorney. The hearing date is 05/22/17 In the meantime WC carrier denies claim (surgery done out of state). Menlo suspends pay till employee returns to work. Employee files for State unemployment in Illinois. Menlo receives 'Notice of claim' from Illinois. Employee states reason for separation - laid off - lack of work. Question - is this enough for Menlo to terminate? Jay Naidu	
1	If there is an employee no call no show for work, can we let them go immediately? If so, how long we need to wait for the employee's response in order to let them go?Also, if we let them go in this situation, should we ready the final paycheck for him/ her by the way? If so, can we mail it to the employee or keep it in the store for the employee pick up?	
4	We have an employee whose performance is not meeting expectations. She recently went through a "performance improvement plan". Her performance improved temporarily and has now fallen to levels below what they were several months ago. We are at the point of needing to dismiss her. If possible, we would like to offer the option of leaving gracefully - quitting. This employee is part-time and we do not intend to offer any severance package. Are we able to offer the option of quitting to her without any written letter/package and ask that if she does quit, she do so effective immediately? Her poor performance has a negative effect on the entire team and we do not want her to work another week or two and further damage morale.	
4	We had an employee we recently sent her a letter in mail for job abandonment . She brought us a note she she had injury outside of work. Cause restrictions. She was going to have restrictions for 8 weeks. We told her we could accommodate for four weeks. Beyond that we would need an updated restriction notes otherwise we couldn't accommodate. I sent her with a doctor with a job description and the 2nd note said she should not be around unexpected things,, especially around children. We could not have her on the floor with the kiddos. We offered her to help the front desk for 2 hours everyday plus 4 hours on Saturday and whenever someone calls out. Around 20 hours a week, she refused. She was upset and left. We told her that at this point we could not give her hours b/c those were the accommodations. She was upset. We gave her a couple days to cool off and then we tried to contact several time. and she would not return or take out calls. We considered it job abandonment. We received a letter from her today that she CC'd what seems to b an attorney . She wants any and all documents in entire HR file. What are we obligated to send her? After this letter was sent, she has contacted one of our patients parents on their personal cell phone regarding our office stating negative things about us. The patient's father called us very upset. What can we do about this?	
3	We terminated an employee who during the process became belligerent. They refused to take the termination letter and separation agreement. They also refused a box to pack their personal belongings and said to mail the belongings to them. What should we do about the termination letter, separation agreement, and their personal belongings? They hoarded a lot of belongings and the box will be expensive to ship.	
3	If we inform an employee that 3 days of missed work with no call will result in a termination and on the third day they do not come in to work or call, can we terminate the employee on the last day that they worked or do we need to terminate them on the last day that they didn't come in to work?	
5	We are considering terminating an employee who's been with us about 6 years. He's our top salesman but he's toxic to our work environment. The has a negative attitude, says in appropriate things (about his privates), about other co-workers, all of which they could claim sexual harassment, an employee resigned because of him, etc. He's been counseled multiple times and we have documentation of this. He's over 40, has a disability and is a gay man. Our other option is to terminate due to restructure of his department. We are looking for a different skill set and his position will no longer exist. What are your thoughts?	
4	We are preparing to terminate an employee for poor performance. She has only been with us for approximately 8 weeks. She did become eligible for health benefits after the first month of employment and she enrolled. In the State of California, what is the required paperwork I must give her upon termination? Thank you.	
5	And employee is terminated. We have his last check. He owes the company more than what his last check is. Can we hold the final check? He had a loan and expense reports that he has not reconciled yet.	
4	An employee gave 2 weeks notice with her last day being tomorrow. Do I need to pay out sick time for her absence today and tomorrow? She's notified us she will be out sick tomorrow, too.	
1	Missouri is an "at will" employer state. Please let me know what wording/communication we can use to terminate a couple of staff. Given a change in management personnel (had to terminate the management), we do not have sufficient documentation regarding performance improvement plans.

If you need to reach me via phone, please contact me at 314 6804255. thanks

4	Employee walked off the job and quit. Manager did not advise HR so the 72 hour window was missed. Employee called about her check and employer agreed to overnight it to the employees home and paid the employee final pay through the date of delivery. Employer received return receipt that delivery was made to the employee's home. The employee then advised the employer that she did not get it because she was not at home the employer cancelled the check and agreed to send the replacement check to the employee's home again. Employee keeps complaining that she is going to the labor commissioner.

4	An employee who has attendance problems, use of cell phone & personal internet usage has reported to me she feels the owner is "hostile" towards her. We were in the process of terminating her and she ended up being out on short term leave due to illness. The owner is not a hostile employer by any means. We need to know how to proceed in termination. Thank you	
5	On Tuesday I received a background check back for an applicant. I advised the manager his background check was ok, and he hired him. I subsequently realized I was looking at the wrong employee file. When we did receive his results, he did not pass. He has suspension, speeding tickets and an accident. We have a very strict policy of not hiring those who do not pass the background check. Can we terminate this employee now?	
3	I was going through our terminated files - pulling out I-9's, when I noticed a lot of employees were terminated due to attendance. Employees were terminated for calling in sick. Should employers be terminating employees for absences?

He did not contact us during this time. Today I called him and he answered his phone. He said, Ill be in tomorrow. When I asked why he hadnt called in, he said, I lost my phone and didnt have your phone number. I asked about googling, etc. then he said, I had a cold. Then he said that he has been talking with his manager that its not worthwhile to come in for a few hours, wants to work more hours on a Saturday. He said the manager had not gotten back with him or told him that was okay. I told him not to plan to come in tomorrow and not until I get back with him. I checked with the manager who said he had looked into it, but the schedule the employee is requesting is not feasible. The schedule hes requesting is not feasible. Can we terminate him? We have heard that it is considered job abandonment after three days of no call no show, is this applicable and would it be a termination or resignation?

Do I have to give that to him? He's a California employee.

We want to terminate him today but I am looking for assistance with the best way to put this in his termination paperwork. He is older so he is in a protective class but bottom line, he doesn't know what he is doing and we can pay somebody $18.00 an hour to stand there and pretend. Please advise. Thank you, Shawna

I have documentation for poor performance, 10 to 15 incidents. I was trying to work with them. I have written them both up. Both have exhausted their paid sick leave. I've lost a couple customers because of their activities. A customer told me today not to have them back. I don't want them to start issues with a new customer.

5	Employee in NY left employment and he has been overpaid for time not worked, how can we remedy?	
0	My client's question: I had an employee get through with us by his own choosing. We had paid him 32 hours vacation of which he had only accrued 29 hours, and we paid him for 40 hours of sick time but has only accrued 18 sick hours. This totals out to 25 hours of non accrued time he was paid. Our employee handbook states any accrued vacation or sick time that has not been used at time of separation will be paid as well as any time paid in excess of what was accrued will be reimbursed to Morrisons. We also found on line ,United States Dept. of Labor, wage and Hour Division, FLSA2004-17NA DATED OCT 6, 2004, states it is ok for us to deduct these over paid wages from his last check. Is there a Mass. law that would over rule the Federal policy or am I within my rights to do this? Please let me know.

1	Hi, We are headquartered in MA and have a few other office locations, one of which is in CA. We are considering closing the CA location which has ~15 EE's + a number of temps (on temp company payroll). We would not be looking to keep these EE's, however, we may open the same role in our headquarters office. What are some of the federal and state compliance issues we should know and need to consider?	
1	We are closing an office in Florida. In our offer letters we include language which states that employees must provide 3 months notice and that we will give 3 months notice if possible when terminating (not for cause). Employees are wanting to know if they would have to wait the full 3 months to get their severance if they get another job offer? Regarding the severance payment do I have to tell the amount now? Or can I wait until the final meeting? I'm concerned that the amount may vary between now and the closing of the business. I'm not even certain of the calculation method at this time.	
0	Our client is seeking data on what is typical for payout of PTO at term - this is mandatory in CA I believe. Does we have data or benchmarking on what is typical in other states?	
2	Do you have a checklist for (self insured) employers in regard to the documentation that should be given when terminating due to a RIF (reduction in Force)? What are the pitfalls and things to watch out for? WE specifically need the correct HIPAA forms. to give to terming EE's.	
3	Do you have any best practice information for an employer that is about to go through a RIF (reduction in force) in regard to their employees who are not being let go? Are there things they can do to make these folks feel more secure from a benefits perspective?	
3	Monday I am going to be terminating two employees for insubordination. When I am walking through the benefits they ask if they can go to unemployment and file unemployment. We do not contest unemployment if they file. Should we tell them that? This may get a little volatile. Our company puts on conferences out of town and we have a strict professional behavior policy and they can be terminated for not following the policy. These two people were doing inappropriate behavior and I was not aware of it until yesterday and the owner met with me and the two managers that they did not show up for work on time,overslept, and they were two people in the hot tub not being appropriate and we have a strict policy.

1	Our HR manual states that with a two week notice, up to 80 hours of PTO will be paid out. We've always used 14 days, as we are open 7 days a week. We have someone who gave their notice on May 1 and said her last day would be the 11th. To us, this is not 14 days. Our manual simply says two weeks, so how do we handle this?	
2	Termination-Punch In Question: A decision is made to terminate an employee for a workplace violation. The employee is scheduled to work from 12:00 until 8:30 am. Can you ask the employee to not punch in and conduct the termination meeting without paying the employee? What if the termination took 15 or 30 minutes? My belief is we allow the employee to punch in and pay them for the time.

5	A client is in a bind. Employee has been out on a comp claim. The claim was closed, the claim was re-opened due to pain. The employee is being an idiot and is fighting the employer and everything they are trying to do and I have emails between the employee and the employer, with the employee telling the employer to "f-off." He won't do anything his supervisor tells him to do. He has always had performance issues. He is only working part of the time - he makes his own schedule. (Describes text messages). He threatens to quit all the time. He is a supervisor - runs crews. Stated he wouldn't do the job for less than others are making.

She said to another group of employees "you better watch your back because she's back now" referring to a manager whom the employees were having problems with.

5	A regular employee did not call up nor show up to work today, Monday. We learned that he was arrested the day before (Sunday). Our policy states that two consecutive days of no call, no show is taken as a decision to quit from the company. In the event that he calls tomorrow to let us know he is incarcerated and will be posting bond and will be released, do we have a valid ground to terminate him on account of his inability to come in to work due to his arrest? He has been previously written up for job performance, disrespectful conduct in the past.

3	Hello, if an employee is let go, and receives a severance payment over the next 2 months.... And the owner agrees to pay 5 months of medical premium for him- Are they allowed to keep paying the premium on the employees behalf or will they need to pay him the amount of what the 5 months premium would total.....and would he need to either go on COBRA or get new insurance ?

There is only one person left and his plan will be terminated at the end of the month. When the company does go out of business in a few months, hes going to look for something else. Do they just cancel him or is it possible the other company could offer COBRA?	
4	We have an employee who gave her notice on 5/18. She was to come in on 19th to discuss the terms of her final day worked and she just came in early, cleaned out her desk and left. She did give a resignation letter, so do we have to pay her two weeks? She is a non-exempt employee.

4	I had an employee verbally resign giving 30 days notice. I instructed her to call her manager instead but found out later that she didn't. At a staff meeting a few days later she announced it to everyone and when asked where she was going her response was 'anywhere but here'. The following scheduled day she showed up late by a few hours without calling. I'm just anticipating that this is how it's gonna go. Additionally, we pay out sign-on bonuses and she's due for a 2nd one at 180 days, it's pretty must when her 30-day notice would expire. Can I turn around and terminate her if she continues violating company policies? Does it matter that I don't have her resignation in writing?

6	A Texas employee resigned last month. We issued the employee's final paycheck and expense reimbursement check. The employee recently contacted us to say he did not receive the expense check. We placed a stop payment on the expense check and were planning to reissue it on our next check run. This week we discovered the employee misused company resources. The employee used the company's wifi hot spot for personal use and incurred $800 in data overage charges on our bill. We pay for a storage place for the company vehicle the employee was responsible for. We were notified by the storage company that the employee had been illegally parking a personal inoperable vehicle in the space with our company vehicle. The storage company had asked him to remove the vehicle on numerous occasions. The employee failed to comply so they contacted us. Can we refuse to reissue the expense check? May we ask the employee to reimburse us for the data costs & the abandoned vehicle towing costs?	
4	I inherited a problem. We have a director who is not capable in supervising staff. Her own work is suffering, spelling, errors, information doesn't match. She has been here eleven years, no reviews prior to 2007. In 2014 she was put on a PIP, and then she improved. There seems to be no consequences for her errors. She recently had an employee who was able to steal money because of her lack of oversight. We are sick and tired of it and are considering terminating At-Will. She is over 60. What would we risk if we let her go?	
4	Employee sent employer an email that she is working with an employment officer and lawyer to get her job back. Employee terminated prior to 2016 however letter was not sent until after the first of the year.	
6	Do we legally need to give a departing employee final pay on their last day of employment or can their final pay be on the next payroll cycle?	
4	We had to let an employee go because it was just not working out with her. When we did, we told her it was because of lack of work. She was full time and there was only about 15 hours of work a week. We did not offer her part time. We would like to bring someone else in. Can this haunt us?	
4	Employer was on FMLA leave through April 10th however she gave notice today that she is resigning.	
4	My question is we have an employee whose last was on 2-14-201. We processed our payroll for Feb 15. She was paid the 1st throgh the 15th. We did not know that her last day was going to be on the 14th. She was overpaid one day. Is it okay in DC to deduct one day from their vacation leave pay out? She has been working remotely from CA.	
4	Termination from maternity leave. We have an employee out on maternity leave who is making disparaging comments about the company on social media. We are in a big recruiting crunch and she is poking at our recruiting efforts, and making negative comments on our pay structure. The manager of the site is FB friends with her.	
4	Hello, We let go of an employee late last year. We had to mail her her termination docs. We have followed up with her because we have not received them. Ive got confirmation that they were received. She has not responded. How would we go about getting these papers from her.	
2	Are there any specific requirements tied to age when offering a severance package? In other words, is there a designated time frame that must be allowed in order for the former employee to either accept or decline the offer based on age, or even just in general?	
5	We have an employee is was under doctor from 1.6.17 till current. We received a doctors note that the employee can not work for a toe and foot injury done outside of work, from 1/25/17 to 2/25/17. Waiting for the follow up from the doctor to see if he is going to be released. This employee has only worked with us since last April 2016. My question is, how long do we need to hold his position at our company if it looks as if he will be on leave for a long while? Also, he is asking about long term disability paperwork from our Life insurance policy.	
3	I received a response to a question I asked earlier today (Issue Response [[294287-296636-1]]. Thank you for the response but the response is addressing my question as a tax issue. My question is more a case of a recently terminated employee misappropriating company resources for personal use. Id like to know if I can apply the expense reimbursement check owed the employee to the personal expenses he incurred using company resources.	
3	Is it legal to hold a paycheck after an employee is terminated? For example, they have company property but will not return it.	
4	I'm trying to find out if we did away with a person's job in one department, but offered them another position at a lower rate and they decided against that, how that will affect unemployment? And the kicker is she has just called back and is thinking about taking the job now. It was actually a demotion - if we terminated her due to lack of skills would she get unemployment?	
3	Can employer terminate an employer for having different political viewpoints?	
0	We have a salaried employee that turned in his two weeks' notice. His last day would be Feb. 28. However, his supervisor felt it best for him to be finished last Friday, the 17th. Can we make the employee use up vacation time for Feb. 20-28? We would then pay out the remaining vacation and sick time in addition to his normal salary on Feb. 28.	
3	We have a California employee that resigned as of 01/17/17. He had a Long Term Growth incentive that was reached from 2015-2016. However, the plan specifically stated, "Payment(s) will be made by March 15th following the close of the accounting cycle from the prior calendar year for each installment. Employee must be on payroll as of March 15th to be eligible for payment(s)". Are we obligated to pay this incentive to the employee based on California law of when an incentive/bonus is "earned"? We found a former court case with similar stipulations that was ruled in favor of the employer because the employee did not fulfill ALL the requirements of the bonus which includes being employed as of a certain time. http://www.laboremploymentlawblog.com/2006/10/articles/wage-and-hour/california-court-of-appeal-confirms-that-employer-can-lawfully-deny-bonus-to-employee-who-is-terminated-prior-to-the-payout-date-if-this-is-consistent-with-the-bonus-policy/	
2	Can I email a copy of the for your benefit booklet to an employee being laid off? Or do I need to print the 27 page booklet out and include in their termination packet?	
1	One of our employees gave a two week notice. May we release her from employment earlier?	
2	I just wanted to talk to someone, we need to do a termination, and I needed to get some guidance regarding termination verses the opportunity to resign in lieu of termination.	
5	We are located in Missouri and have an employee that lives in Michigan and are terminating him but he has unapproved charges of over $2000. on his company credit card. Can we deduct this from his final check as long as he does not go below minimum wage?	
3	can a employee be dismissed for absences due to child care	
6	We are terminating an employee today. Can we pay him an extra day and overnight the check so that he receives it tomorrow?	
1	My question is regarding reduction in force layoff for a small business. We have 4 people we decided to RIF. I am creating a spreadsheet with criteria - no protected classes. Performance and tenure and restaurant location. Is there anything I am missing? We are paying a week severance for anyone who has been there a year or more?	
5	I called before about employee that we terminated I sent him letter and his final check. That was sent certified mail on Feb. 7th and I have not received anything from post office and I don't believe the check has cleared. I will call the post office to see what happened to the return receipt. I called him and phone is disconnected. Then I called his brother and his brother said they were not speaking and he would let his other brother know and have him let the brother know final check is on the way. What should I do?	
0	Small Business owner..... question about vacation....is it accurred ?...when someone gives us their notice...do we have to pay out vacation pay? Notice will be effective on March 4th....no vacation time (PTO's)has been taken...do we pay her all vacation pay that she would of gotten this year	
3	Letter from TWC charge back, we are not the last employer. I just want to make sure I fill it out correctly. The employee worked 6 hours, and never came back.	
1	The company is in New York and the employees is in Washington DC. What can we do in regards to severance. How much time do we need to provide?	
6	Under Arkansas law I read that the final check is due within 7 days. but I also read, or next regular payroll unless they request it within the 7 days. I just wanted to make sure of that. Also, ff they have comp prop that they have not returned, under Arkansas law are we allowed to hold final pay checks for any amount of time until we get that back?	
4	We have a new hire (e.g. within 90 days), that is a problem child. She takes unscheduled breaks and leaves before the end of her shift. Last week she even cleaned out her workstation and we suspect she resigned. She reported to work and apologized. We really want to terminate the employee as she is failing to abide by the policies. Can we terminate?	
4	We hired a girl last week and her first day was Saturday. She had a verbal altercation with another girl that day. We pulled them into the office and told them this was not acceptable. After that, she said something else to another stylist and upset her. She did not come in Sunday but came in today and had another altercation with another girl today. We pulled her into the office today and and she got upset so we asked her to leave. She has refused to leave now.	
4	We have an employee who has an open WC case. She has been working for us in her regular position but we are concerned she might have another injury. We would like to settle the case and ask her resignation. Can we do this?	
3	New Jersey Group- Fully-Insured. Employees pay for their medical contributions on a weekly basis. When they are terminated, the employer will continue coverage until the end of the month. If an employee leaves employment and has only paid 1 week of contributions, can the employer take the last 3 weeks of contributions from the last payroll check?	
3	I have an employee in Texas that I need to terminate, and we are an employer based in CA. He is an "at will" employee per our offer to him. Is there anything I need to do special because of Texas? Or can I just terminate him? And btw- he has only been with our company 6 weeks. I don't know if if is easier to terminate an employee when it's less than 90 days. I will be re-hiring for the position. thanks	
1	We are putting together a settlement for a former employee who has threatened to bring a suite against us. Our attorney is suggesting that we provide him with two checks. one is to be payroll check (w-2) for lost wages, how would be go about doing that since he is no longer an employee?	
1	An employee has been suspended and we would like to terminate as of tomorrow. I know I have to provide full wages on termination. Her hours from May 1st through 15th are in process and are deposited automatically on the 25th. It's too late to pull the deposit back - would that make me out of compliance?	
1	We have an employee we are considering terminating due to on-going performance issues. What should we keep in the file to document the termination?	
5	I have a gentleman who was promoted to quality manager position March 27th. We did a 7 hour meeting with executives in April with headquarters and after he did not return to work. On April 8 he said he was running late bringing his kids to school then didn't come in and called saying he wouldn't be in for personal reasons. The manager tried to call and it went to voicemail. I called him and he said he needed to take care of his kid, he said he got an MRI and the doctor found something and he thinks he has anxiety. I explained FMLA and he said he wanted to go back to his old job. On May 2nd I gave him the FMLA paper work. It's been a week since reporting to work. On the 12th he NCNSed, on the 16th we noticed he went into the system and did some work. The last time we heard from him was May 17th and he still has not provided any doctors notes or contacted us.	
4	We have a long-time employee out on long-term disability and has been since July 2015. We held her job for this long, however it's unlikely that she will be returning after all this time. We'd like to terminate her in order to hire to fill her position (she'd still be covered by the LTD). Do we need to get doctor certification that she can't work at this time to do so?	
2	In the involuntary termination checklist, one line states "provide final paycheck and collect the Final Paycheck Acknowledgement form." I'm unable to find the acknowledgement form on the ThinkHR website. Can someone please send to me? Thank you!	
5	Ricki Kline Designs Plus Build Caller: Rashida #323-270-4571 email: Rashida@rickikline.com We are in CA. I have an employee resigning this Friday. He took more vacation than he accrued. Can we deduct that from his last check? 6-8 days he owes the company.	
1	One of our employees whose son is in our program, was found doing something sexual with another student. The girl who was involved said it was forced. The employee whose son was involved, posted on social media details about the incident and the issue. We have a social media policy. Through Instagram posted a picture and threatened the Mom of the girl who was involved, you should look both ways before you pass me. Be worried, you better run...you better walk the other way. On social media, she threatened the girls mom, karma is a b word, in reality the story doesnt make any sense. We knew what we got with our son, and know what we raised. Referencing the girl, Does your mama know what she got? You should be feeling like a dirty b word. Our employee tagged the girls Mom. So the girl wasnt directly named, the Mom is tagged, so obvious who and what its about. We have pictures of the comments she posted. Do we need to be specific in our termination letter about this?	
4	We have a client in FL, who has had a problem with an employee in February (messing up). They gave her a written warning at that time and it said if it happened again it may lead to termination. Yesterday she sent an email to a client which should not have been sent out. It caused a major disruption and issue with the company. They want to terminate her today. She is over age 40 and is having a pacemaker put in in a couple of weeks and would have been on a leave. We want to discuss risks.	
3	Can I terminated an employee while on workers' comp	
0	What is NY state's policy on PTO at time of termination? Does it need to be paid out? Our employee handbook is silent on that matter. Thank you.	
4	Question Good Afternoon, I am not sure who to contact on this or exactly where to begin. My son's girlfriend was recently laid off from her job. She worked in Massachusetts for a company that hired a lot of seasonal employees. She work for them for more than ten years and has been a full time employee for more than two years. She was never paid over time or sick time. She also had 350 hours of vacation time that they never paid to her when she was laid off. The reason she was laid off was because she was "single" and they wanted her to work after hours running a volley ball tournament.(Which she had done in the past.) She said she was planning on taking night courses and could not do it this summer. She was told that because she was single and did not have family obligations she was required to do so. My question is who does she reach out to as there are definitely violations made by this company? I apologize for such a long note but would appreciate any advice to lead her in the right direction..

4	A termination for a person that is 66 years old and a female. She is a direct report of mine. The reason is lack of competency I do have demonstrated examples and she states she does not know how to do it. I am wondering about your thoughts on termination?	
5	We have an employee who stared a leave on 9.13.2016, it was approve through our third party vendor for 2 weeks as a STD case and then on the third week the STD was denied, he continued on a unpaid leave of absence and then we did not hear anything from him after communication and were forced to terminate his benefits effective 1.9.17 due to non-payment. Due to FLMA and ADA guidelines he is currently still out on an unpaid leave. The business is now falling behind in his position and we need to hire someone. What kind of notice do we need to send this employee before we can administratively term him? Do we need to send him a e-mail notice 60 or 30 days before his leave reaches its year mark and let him know that due to business needs we will need to administratively term him? Thank you

The new employee has missed many days of employment for inconsistent reasons. The owner feels the new employee's employment should be terminated due to these circumstances. What steps should be taken and what precautions need to be viewed in this situation? They want to make sure they are following the correct procedures and include the correct information in the termination letter. Can you please provide some guidance?	
3	Client needs advice regarding layoff. Client is a printing company in FLA and employs 5 employees who work at a client's job site NY doing fulfillment for the FLA company; NY company is asking FLA company to indemnify them for the layoff of these 5 employees. Layoff is due to the printing company change in operations and all fulfillment will be done in FLA going forward.	
1	We have an intern who we hired for a part-time position. The offer letter did not have an end date to the internship. We want to close out the internship with this individual and then hire another intern. Would there be any issues with this?	
4	I would like to terminate an employee based on several performance-related issues. We have been communicating and writing her up but given the last incidents, we feel we need to let her go. Some of the issues include: taking twice the time to do a cut than expected completing half the number of cuts than her colleagues (this and the above are communicated on a daily basis) has cut 3 customer's ears doesn't follow dress codes, when a manager leaves she removes required garments talks back to manager and unprofessional with customers attendance is poor	
1	I also have some questions about eliminating positions and avoiding potential law suits. We are possibly eliminating a position. We are taking the tasks and divvying them up. We may hire someone in a few months is to take some of the tasks back. Is there a time frame before we can hire somebody back and avoid a lawsuit?	
4	We hired a new employee to start in May. Due to various reasons, she has only been at work for a total of three days since starting. Supposed to start on May 1st, but due to road flooding couldn't make it in the first week, so extended start date to May 8th - on May 8th she didn't have cell phone and grandmother passed away - on the 9th she wouldn't be in until Wednesday - on the 10th wouldn't be in because their minivan broke down - came in on the 10th and 11th. May 15th her daughter broke her leg on Sunday so on 16th - not in on Wed or Thursday - came in on Friday May 19th. May 22nd left her keys in boyfriend's car. Today she was out for the same reason due to not having her keys. We have decided to terminate her employment. What should we advise the employee? We want to be in compliance.	
2	Via email: Julia Petrini Hello Suzanne - can you maybe chat today if you are around? Anytime, whatever works best for her. Just send me a note few minutes ahead. Thanks a lot!	
3	Jhanell Rocha, jhanell.goodwin@delfinasf.com, 415-967-2878 Termination process. What does the employer do for final pay if the employee works and earns tips? What does the employer do if the employee has stated in the termination documentation that he/she will pick up the check and they do not pick it up (the employee has the option to request that the employer mail the check in the termiantion documentation)?	
3	If there are job requirements that have to do with lifting, pushing, etc. and the employee no longer has the ability to perform such physical tasks is termination legally warranted?	
2	when to use "RIF" and when to use termination	
2	exit interview	
2	Are termination letters required in certain states (specifically Oregon)? When not required, do you recommend employers provide letters to voluntary or involuntary terminating employees as a best practice?	
6	We have a new employee who has been here less than 90 days (she is in Florida). We send the final check from CA, when is final pay due?	
2	What is the average separation pay that companies provide?	
4	I am terminating an employee on Thursday. I will have her final check with accrued, unused vacation. I was told I needed to give her an EDD pamphlet, is that correct? Change in relationship form, is that required? Do I circle discharged? Ignore 2 and 3? She has benefits.	
4	An employee has a written agreement with us where she works full time during the school year and 10 hours per week during the summer months. She notified us recently that she will not be returning at the end of the summer months. May we let her go at this time, as we really do not need her services over the summer months. We have "at will" language in our handbook, but no at will language in the offer letter. She signed the offer letter agreeing to the terms and conditions of working FT during school year and 10 hrs/week during summer for a fixed annual salary. Is that a contract?	
4	We offered an employee a transfer to another position and she declined. Therefore, we are keeping her employed until we find her replacement. Once her replacement is found, will that be a resignation or involuntary termination, and how will that impact UI?	
6	We just had an employee pass away. Can we give their last paycheck to their spouse?	
4	We received a letter from the mn department of human services stating an employee was ineligible to provide unsupervised services for people receiving services by the department of human services. Resulting in suspension until we received 3 documents; disqualification letter from DHS, copy of request for reconsideration, and notice from DHS indicating you are able to resume work. This employee was sent 3 warning letters about getting these documents in and failed to do so. Forcing us to discontinue her employment. This employee has now filed for unemployment. It has been determined that she is eligible for benefits, if we do not appeal. How is she eligible for UI if DHS made the determination that she cannot work unsupervised? and she did not contact DHS in the allocated time period. Do we have a stand to appeal?	
2	Under the OWBPA, does the terminated employee over age 40 who signs a severance agreement and waiver have 7 business days or seven calendar days to revoke the agreement? Would an employee under age 40 have any such rights to revoke a severance agreement and waiver? We wouldn't want to pay out a severance check to someone under 40, then have them revoke the agreement say after one, three, etc. days of signing the agreement.	
5	We had an employee arrested and put in jail. We coordinated for him to go on work release. He worked last Thursday, and then he went to wal-mart on his break which was an infraction of his work release. He told his guard that he went to wal-mart for work, which was a lie. Now he's back in jail. Are we required to continue his employment?	
4	Regarding whether I can safely terminate a CA employee or not based on the circumstances. We have a California employee who has cash missing from her office. We do not have proof that she took it but she was the last person who had access to it. In addition, we have proof that she was changing numbers in our system to get additional commissions that she is not entitled to. She has gone into unpaid time and owes 88 hours. She sent an email saying she is going through difficult personal things and that she is going to a therapist to straighten things out.	
3	Must we complete DE-2063 form? This is not a short-term layoff, we notified them the layoff is long-term, not temporary. One employee has already gone to the EDD and applied for unemployment. Are they going to deny him UI if this is a permanent layoff? This is a permanent job/status change to part-time.	
5	We were going to lay off an employee today but he called in sick. We have his final check ready to go, how should we manage? If we delay until tomorrow, we will have an extra day of paid sick leave to pay, and there is no guarantee that he will show up tomorrow.	
4	An employee has been granted a personal leave. I told her we follow company policy and its written in her letter that her return is dependent on the work load. Now she is returning and we don't have enough work. Is it a resignation or a lay off? What are the implications of each? This is our slow time of year.	
5	David J. Martin DDS PA: Lorraine Di Pentima 973-942-6467 drsmarfer@aol.com We hired an employee and are considering terminating him. Could he be found eligible for benefits?	
4	We'll be letting an employee go during the probationary period. Legally when we let someone go, normally I understand we want to give a reason - do we have to provide a written letter only upon request, even for probationary employee termination? The supervisors want some talking points and we have a termination form we fill out with our reasonings, etc. I need some help with saying enough but not too much. I am anticipating this discharge can result in some sort of claim with this person. I am trying to minimize liability on this issue. She is over 40 and Native American. The supervisor has provided documentation. On May 5th, she was asked to do something, she didn't do it (this is the group working the correctional facility) and I guess there's a policy where you cannot have your cell phone in a certain medical area. The employee responded that an officer told her she could have the cell phone and the supervisor told her to take the phone up front and she said she would if she had time. The supervisor checked in with an officer and they looked at video footage and couldn't verify if she actually took the phone out. The person she is seen talking to is an officer who also happens to be her domestic partner. Then there have been some other incidents where she is refusing to be train to draw blood. I don't know if its in her job description and I don't know how her supervisor dealt with it. Others are having to do veinpuncture instead of her. She's just lazy and not really engaged. Sometimes they have to go out and triage and provide care and she is not participating and will do anything possible to stay seated and not see an inmate. She needs reminders to do charting, issues with sharps log, employee stated she did not know she did not how to sign out a sharp. Tools left in autoclave for 4 days, she was initialing. An employee was providing a medication to a patient and she questioned the high dose, the other employee had put the incorrect dose down on the chart (the inmate received too much over nights). Another new employee, who is also a new RN came in feeling very sick, self diagnosed with strep. He was chatting with the employee, who recommended he take antibiotics from the destroy box and he did. The employee is refusing to confirm she was the one who told him to do that.	
2	Upon layoff or termination of an employee is it mandatory by the department of labor to provide a termination letter? Our office has a letter in place which states the option to state continuation for medical coverage after termination and an exit checklist. Our handbook does state that we are an "at will" employer so not sure if something in writing is necessary for a termination. Please advise what are the right notices for layoff/terminated employees. Thank You, Rosie Orozco

4	Employee hired to work any shift and any day and now she is stating that she cannot work a certain schedule any more. Can the employer terminate this employee?	
6	We have an employee who is leaving company, turned in 30 day notice. It was voluntary and they are salaried. I'm hoping to confirm the correct way to make the final pay. How does it work when we received a 30 day notice and the 30 day notice is short of a full pay check (2 days short) Can I deduct the 2 days?

1	We have an employee that we would like to let go and would like to discuss the risks. The employee was offered another internal job and has gone back and forth on acceptance. In addition, she has been negative and complaining about the company.	
4	We have an employee who had a stroke 4 months ago and it is likely she will never be able to return to work. She did not get on disability because her physician and the convalescent home she is at told her it wasn't necessary. At this point in time, I would like to formally terminate her from our company. (We have 45 employees and are in California). She is on state Medicaid and chose not enroll in the insurance offered through our company. Can I terminate her since she is no longer able to work?	
3	I terminated an employee on Feb. 10 for performance problems with verbal and written warnings. I'm completing the unemployment notice of claim form and wanted your opinion.	
5	We are located in Missouri and have an employee that lives in Michigan and are terminating him but he has unapproved charges of over $2000. on his company credit card. Can we deduct this from his final check as long as he does not go below minimum wage?	
5	Sales person in Maine was placed on a 30 day PIP. During that time, we lost a client due to his poor sales performance. We terminated him prior to the end of his PIP and provided him with written notice of termination. Our Director of Ops has asked if we can change termination date to Feb 28, rather than Feb 15 and although he will not continue to work for us, we will pay him through Feb 28. Is that acceptable? Should we explain our reasons (PIP completion) in the amended separation notice and have him sign?	
5	Up Level Security; Stephanie call back # 917-981-1247 stephanie@uplevelsecurity.com It's regarding the last pay checks for people who have quit. He gave his 2 weeks today. Company located in New York State and so is employee.	
1	I sent an email earlier , see case number [[294836-297096-1]] (employee in Texas, my company is in CA) Anyway, to follow up, I would like to terminate an employee and the reasons are that while we just hired the person, they really do not seem to have the skillsets we require. What do we need to do to terminate based on this? We are a small company, less than 20 employees, and developing a performance improvement plan, and evaulating every couple of weeks etc, documenting continued issues, etc, is just a tremendous burden to us. Please advise what's the best approach to terminating with less work since the employee is "at will" and we are not terminating for any illegal reason.	
4	Employee proved notice and her last day will be Thursday. I need to know what exactly we will need to provide to her on her last day. She is on our benefits so please let us know what we would need to provide to her as far as COBRA information as well.	
1	If an employee has been let go effective 2/22/17 for inadequate performance after being with the company for roughly 8 months (6/15/16 start date) do they have any right to demand more than two weeks of severance (which is what we offered) and that we cover his family's insurance costs through the end of March 2017 (we offered to cover through the end of February only)?	
6	An employee gave notice today that his final day would be tomorrow. When is his final check due?	
0	NY ee is leaving the company on March 3rd and has several days of vacation pay owed to them. The vacation days would last until April. Does the company need to cover the health insurance for April?	
2	Good day, Please be advised that we were contacted this morning by the Alabama Department of Labor regarding failure to file a Form Ben241 which is essentially a separation of notice form for Alabama. I am looking for some sort of explanation to this as per my email below from ThinkHR, I was told that there was no form that was required to be filed with this termination we made back in December. Pleased to receive your reply soonest... Kind regards, Dustin Berthelot Nord-Sud Shipping, Inc.	
5	We have an employee who reported an injury in September. His injury has not moved from his head to his neck to his shoulders. Our WC insurance has established that his continuing injury is not related to his initial injury. Therefore, they have stopped payment. We do not have an estimate return to work date. How long before we can terminate his employment?	
1	It looks like we are going to need to have a reduction in force, but then we are going to need to turn around and hire again for these positions. In prior employment we have offered severance to some people have had them sign an agreement that they will not sue the company. Is that generally allowed? Do you have a sample of this type of an agreement?	
4	We have a question regarding an employee who is on light duty due to a workers compensation issue. We have made accommodations for her as required, however, her performance is severely lacking. She was overheard yesterday telling a customer that some of our product was "mystery meat". She also was on a 6.5 hour schedule as an accommodation, and after 1 hour into her shift she took her meal break. This was before other employees who had been there longer had even taken theirs. We have suspended her, and are considering termination, but are concerned because of the workers compensation.	
3	Chantelle J - CA ER, when to start counting penalty for waiting time? The employee quit without notice on 2/13.	
0	If an employee has left employment and has several months of sick and vacation time he will be paid out on when do the benefits terminate? Less than 20 employees. Thanks!	
2	Our client, Steve Ward, is looking for a sample separation agreement for when they terminate an employee as well as any language for a waiver in the event they offer a severance thus having the employee commit to not legal action. Any sample forms and help on standard protocol would be helpful. Thanks so much!	
4	I had submitted an issue on Friday, Feb. 17, 2017 and not heard a response yet. You reopened on Tuesday, Feb. 21st. The issue:we had an employee who was off work since January 31st without medical documentation. She notified supervision that she would be off work but never submitted medical documentation. She then called on Feb. 16th (her year anniversary date) and stated that she resigned. She never submitted medical documentation. I am contemplating the response - I am addressing both the resignation without 2 weeks notice and being on an undocumented, unapproved leave of absence. Both are not acceptable conduct. Our HR Policy manual needs to be more detailed and address 'AWOL, 'Voluntary Quits' as well as being on an undocumented, unapproved medical leave. I know to allow 15 calendars for a person on FMLA to submit . We need to address the non-FMLA allotted days to provide medical documentation or be considered AWOL in our HR. I think seven (7) days.	
1	I need to terminate a couple of employees based on a situation, and I just want to get some guidance on that.	
1	We have an employee who had a work authorization expire. We have not scheduled him, but it has been two months so far. Do we need to put him on a LOA? We have a former employee who was laid off. We paid severance. We have received a notice from the state unemployment asking us to list money paid upon separation. Would this be the severance?	
4	An ex-employee quit on her own because she was caught using company time for something else. She gave 2 weeks notice. After that she called in sick, then we paid her the rest of the week and let her go (5 to 7 days). Can I request for UI ruling?	
5	An employee quit without any notification - I have a written employee contract where they promise to give me 14 days notice but I have at-will employment but that is that is more for the employer's side, right? He wrote a note on 2/10 that he was taking an "extended break" and we were in text contact discussing our differences. He came in on February 16 with written notice. He contacted us on February 21 asking that his final paycheck be mailed. How much do I owe him? By law does he have to give two weeks notice? He was non-exempt and was only in for a few minutes. I informed him he was in breach of the employee contract. Parking reimbursement was paid as a favor. Do I owe those? He is asking for monthly parking - this was a favor.	
2	We do not offer severance to separating employees ,except under specific circumstances. Our state agency auditor would like for us to include language in our handbook that addresses this. Can you help us construct sample language, or do you have a sample policy that you can share?	
3	Up Level Security; Stephanie call back # 917-981-1247 stephanie@uplevelsecurity.com I wanted to confirm that if the employee terminates on March 3rd, I only need to pay him through March 3rd.	
1	We have an employee who was investigated and was subsequently terminated today for multiple violations of multiple company policies.

2	Can you please send information about layoffs and ways to analyze and document who is selected for layoff? (Issue 2 of 2)	
4	We have an employee who has had several write ups, the most recent was on 2/16, for offenses on 2/14 and 2/12. She has two final written warnings and has had severance unexcused absences without pay. We provide services to adults with disabilities and when an employee is assigned to one or more clients, they are responsible for them, unless they "endorse" their care to another employee and that other employee verbally accepts that "endorsement." Yesterday she had two clients assigned to her. One client needed a catheterization, but she isnt trained for that. She went to another employee to ask for help. That person said she already had 3 clients and initially said no. When she asked again, since there was no other person to do it. She said she'd go do it, and she assumed that this employee who was requesting her help, was going to watch her three clients. Instead she not only didn't oversee the other employees three clients, but she didn't oversee her other assigned client and left the area to take a personal call. She took this time away without endorsing someone else to commit to watching her one and the other employee's three clients. Rather, she left her other client unintended and unendorsed. When we found out about the situation we asked her about it. She said she did endorse her client to someone else, but she cant say to whom it was. She said it was a male. We spoke with every male who was working, and no one could confirm that she had endorsed her client to anyone else. We would like to discuss the situation in particular her disciplinary status and risks of termination. (Issue 1 of 2)

3	We have an employee in GA who went out on FMLA for their own serious medical condition in December last year. They will not be able to return before the end of their 12 weeks and will need to be out until May per their doctor's notes on the FMLA form. Over the last few weeks, the manager of the employee has realized his current employees are able to easily cover the extra work from the employee on FMLA. So the manager is wanting to eliminate the position of the employee out on FMLA once FMLA has been exhausted. What are our options to eliminate the position post FMLA with the employee is still disabled?	
1	We have remote pharmacists that we reimburse for them to receive out-of-state licenses. We would like to include in their employment agreement and in our company handbook that we would like for them to give us a 2 month advance notice of separation, because we have taken time and effort to reimburse them for these licenses. Is that acceptable? We are at-will employers. Can you provide me with a termination notice that we may use?	
6	I had an issue with an employee and the police was called. I felt the last encounter created an unsafe environment for him to come back to issue his final wages. I was advised by some there that I should confirm his address before sending his final wages. Two packages were sent to his last know addresses by certified mail with his termination forms and asking him to confirm the address so I could mail out his final check. Each was delivered but I think he's not responding in attempt to become eligible for the 30 days of late penalties. How do you recommend I handle this?	
6	An employee resigned from their position, came in to pick up their check, but it wasn't ready so they said they would be back later that day to pick it up. It has not been a week and the employee is unreachable. We have tried to contact the employee, but we are unable to reach him/her. Can we mail the check or should we hold onto it?	
6	We have a terminated CA sales person who is refusing to turn in his expense report and return our property. He owes us money and I think he's concerned we'll attempt to deduct from that final check. We know we can't. What is our obligation to pay out expenses to terminated employees in CA.	
4	A payroll employee was very unhappy with her pay and would continuously bring up the fact that she was underpaid. Anytime someone would get a pay raise, she would become very upset and on two occasions quit. On the third occasion, we accepted her resignation and walked her out the door. We have now received paperwork for her EDD and the statement is that she was fired for arguing wiht her supervisor about her wages. This is not a true statement. She was not terminated, we accepted her resignation. Do I appeal this decision?

She has been spoken to about it several times with one formal verbal warning & today a written warning. She has mentioned migraines & another illness, but says she will get it taken care of & not be absent anymore, but still is. Can we terminate?

5	Can an employee voice record a manager without the manager's knowledge or consent? We terminated an employee for taking extra and unapproved breaks. He is now stating that he has taped recordings of his supervisor saying inappropriate things. He has not alluded to what those things are, but he's demanded his job back and threatening to sue. I've spoken with the manage, and at no time did he know he was being tape nor did he consent to be being taped. The manager says that while he may have discussed personal things that could be embarrassing, like who he was dating. he says there was nothing job related that we have anything to be concerned about.	
6	If an employee is terminated mid-month and we have pre-paid insurance and we have the final check coming up, do we still take the deduction?

2	Please send all the paper work needed to give for voluntary termination. The employee is officially resigning at the end of month and so/so on Friday.	
4	We have a doctor that has a staff member that is not working out. Mostly it is the relationships with the other staff. She has given the employee an evaluation and after reviewing, it appears the issue was an isolated incident that has already been resolved with the staff, she has listed other improvements for this employee but it has nothing to do with the staff member. The doctor has had a follow up with the employee a week later which I feel is not enough time to re-evaluate on what was needed to improve. The doctor is also wanting to terminate the employee, but I dont believe this would be a cause for termination. I know that Illinois is an at-will state, but is there another approach that can be taken? As I believe that if she decided to terminate the employee she may be liable for paying unemployment. I am not sure if she has had any prior conversations with the employee about the issues with other staff members. Any suggestions would be helpful.	
5	About an employee and issues we are having with frequent absences and 90 day intro period. Knowing what our options are if we are considering this employee go. Want to make sure we are in compliance with the CA laws for termination. The manager has been sharing that the employee has not lived up to the skills portrayed in the interview. He has had personal illnesses and one absence for taking care of a sick child. The frequent absences have effected production. He can't make up time because he is not knowledgeable or skilled enough to make up hours on his own later in the day. He has asked to make up time. Lack of skill and knowledge, plus the absences, which he cannot make it up due to the lack of skills and knowledge. We're trying to figure out what steps we should take. I believe we have a 90 day probation on paid sick leave, I have to check. He was hoping to prove he was "worth it" and get a raise within 90 days. There's two jobs in his area, he portrayed he was very skilled with the programming work and he is not capable of being as skilled in the programming work. We had hoped he would step up and we could hire another person and move him up. Seven different days he missed and most are for his kid. Today he said the child had a stomach virus. How do we find a labor attorney?

0	I am a Great Clips franchisee in Pennsylvania and Delaware. 2 Questions about terminated/quit employees and if I need to pay "vacation time" and partial bonuses. First "vacation time" , its in quotes because I don't give vacation time or vacation time off. What I do is each June and December I pay people what I term a "working bonus" Roughly I take how long they worked for me and how many hours they worked the previous 6 months and calculate a bonus amount. Then I just pay the amount. Employees are not give vacation days, nor are they required to take any days off. They can also take off any days they want as long as we are staffed. Manager Bonus - My managers are on a monthly bonus plan based on hitting certain metrics during the month. If I fired someone mid-month do I need to give them a partial bonus? I'm not sure how I would calculate it since it based on monthly metrics.

4	We have an employee who does a great job with her assigned duties. However, the core duty of working well with her boss has been an issue of concern that has escalated over the last 2 years. This employee has been with our organization 14 years. There have been 3 documented instances of coaching to improve the working relationship, one with an outside consulting group. We are at a point of the 3rd coaching session failing and see the need to immediately terminate. Is there a checklist or recommended to-dos you would recommend to protect our company? Our employee code is "Employees are expected to work together in a spirit of cooperation..." We are finding this is not occurring to the detriment of our company. The employee works well with everyone else in the office, she does not feel she can trust her boss she could be fired any day. Her boss has reiterated to her and the owners of the organization many times over the last 2 years that is not her intention. However, it is time.

5	An employee became elig for benefits Feb 1. He was provided enrollment forms but never turned them in. He is now being terminated for cause (performance). The HR Manager is going to include language in his termination letter that he was elig for health benefits and has until his last day of employment (today) to enroll. If he chooses to enroll today, he will be required to sign an authorization allowing company to deduct the monthly benefit premium from his final check. If he does not allow, he will be required to write a personal check for the amount of the EEs share of the premium. His failure to do so will void his enrollment in benefits and his ability to select COBRA. Is this acceptable?

1	We have two employees that vocalized discontent with one another. The problem stems from Employee A, who has been observed not working on many occasions. This is an on-going matter we have addressed from a productivity standpoint, and reminded her to stop surfing the net/chatting on her cell phone. Employee B confronted Employee A in a voice match. We did meet with both employees and stressed importance of getting along for the good of the team and being cordial to one another. We did pull Employee A aside and discussed her attitude problem, which is among another issues with the employee. We advised both employees we were hitting the reset button and spelled out our expectations. Today while we were meeting with Employee B, Employee A made a rather snitty statement to another co-worker about Employee Bs whereabouts and they are watching me. We have decided to simply dismiss this employee is this proper?

She then came onsite requesting a notice of termination. Employee was in outside sales and he was moved to a different department to help with accounting and HR. Employee has a company email address, he is copying his personal email to all email interactions.

4	An employee gave two weeks notice and one week has passed by. We want to pay her out but she tends towards paranoia so we'd like to ensure she sees the positive side of things. Part of this is because we have more work than people right now and we've been asking for volunteers to go home.	
1	I have never had to process a layoff. We have one situation where one person is going to be laid off. There is just not enough work any longer. Newer, been here a little over year, over the age of 40. There are other employees who also do the same job. He was the last person hired with the least seniority.

4	We had an employee that we let go on Monday - she was asked to do a task on Friday and she did not. The owner confronted the employee and on Monday after the confrontation she left. When she reported back to work she was extended the option to resign or be fired. The employee called back and asked about compensation for the day she was absent. She then came onsite requesting a notice of termination. Employee was in outside sales and he was moved to a different department to help with accounting and HR. Employee has a company email address, he is copying his personal email to all email interactions.	
4	We have an employee in Florida we terminated. She stated she visited customers and when we did a random check we found she never visited them. She wants to talk. She is probably going to ask her expense response, because it did not match sales force. If we say we will pay the travel expenses, will she say see, there are no discrepancies. These are mileage discrepancies and when we were trying to verify the expenses, this is how we determined she was not making the visits. She is saying she visited him 4 times in January. She was checking in near her home. She has been on a PIP. We did not do an investigatory interview. She is always blaming sales force issues on her phone. She was terminating for unsatisfactory job performance related to 4 complaints from customers. She filed a retaliation EEOC complaint for time off for her child (she took the time off).	
1	Managers who are commission only, get paid once a month, and we give them a draw once a month. If we had an outstanding draw and the person terminates mid-month, what would happen.	
3	Hello, In the case in which a terminating employee is asked to repay relocation and bonuses upon terminating (under the condition that they would have to repay if they left before the one year mark), what are the laws for New York in the instance that the employee doesn't repay before their last day? Would we legally be able to withhold their last paycheck until repayment is received? Please let me know what you think. Thank you!

5	A background check came back on an employee that we just hired. He has several convictions and arrests. Felonies and misdemeanors. The nature of his crimes are Identity Theft (2 convictions), possession of drug paraphernalia, prostitution and solicitation, petty theft and under the influence/controlled substance. I want to terminate his employment because he goes to our customer's homes on a daily basis. My question to you is could this be viewed as discrimination? We do have other employees who work for us that have felonies.	
6	Can we send an employee's final paycheck by mail or do we have to send it with a receipt?	
4	Employee resigned, we decided to pay for two weeks and let her go. What if she asks if she can stay for day? The managers are concerned she will fake an injury and be on workers comp because that is what her friend did.

5	A VP wants to terminate an employee who has been here less than a year. The employee walked out in the middle of a performance meeting. Would this be misconduct. The manager was present as a witness. The employee doctored another employees report and passed it off as his. He contacted another employee and stated he walked out because "they were going to fire me anyways." He is over age 40. The employee has our vehicle he left in it. He also has our tools and products.

4	We are based in NYC but have employees in other states. One of our offices in is upstate NY where there is not much management oversight. We rely on feedback from the office manager. For this week I did peer reviews from teammates. Im trying to figure out if this one female employee is really producing. She has been with the company for 5 months. The team up there has 4 females, and 1 male. The male employee had nothing negative to say, however all the females had negative feedback for this one employee. Comments like she is not overly ambitious, slow, lacks teamwork, quality of work overall is pretty good, her direct manager says it is hit or miss. On the positive she asks questions, but many of the questions are premature or repetitive. She is not understanding process and flow of work. She takes a long time to turn over work products. She comes in late, mistakes are glaring, critical thinking skills are faulty. The team communicates through Skype everyone knows if you have down time, let people know. She is only person who doesn't do it. Takes a lot of smoke breaks, comes in late every single day. Culture there is to be on time and leave on time. Im trying to figure out if we should just terminate her.	
4	An employee was seen changing her timecard. May we terminate her for that? We have placed her on suspension while we investigate. Must we pay her while she is on suspension?	
4	An employee with less than 90 days service resigned on Wed. She had accrued PTO, but is not able to use it until after 90 days. Must we still pay out her PTO? She notified us on Wed, but she will not be able to return to the office to pick up her check. How do I get her final check to her on time (72 hours)? She has our keys, and we have all EEs sign a document that they will be charged $25 if they do not return the keys. May I deduct that from her final paycheck?	
2	Hello! I am revisitng exit interview questions. Do have any suggestions for a place that is high intense? like in a social work place.	
3	Hello, My company is considering asking an employee to retire. She is 67. I remember there being an exception which allows "forced" termination for highly compensated individuals. Is that true? If so, what is that minimum? Also, what is the best way to encourage her to retire and avoid legal exposure.	
1	We just terminated an employee and she was quite upset by it and threatened to commit suicide. What should we do?	
1	Hi! We have an employee (fake name "Bob") that we separated with as he was stealing from the company. There was an investigation, and we have been recouping the money over time from Bob. That was handled and no questions there. Where I have a question -- it just came to light that a different employee ("Sarah") who is currently dating this previous employee, Bob. Furthermore, we have found out that Sarah may have been dating Bob not only currently but also may have been dating Bob while he was stealing from the company. There is currently no data suggesting that she helped steal and we also haven't asked her yet if she knew about Bob stealing from the company while he was doing it. However, I want to know what legally we can do given that we provide each of our employees access to a lot of information and also a lot of autonomy in their roles. From a security standpoint, Sarah dating Bob could put us at risk of fraud and leak of information. Wondering what is in legal bounds? Thanks	
4	We have an employee that is on personal unpaid leave. She had a leave approved for a certain amount of time but he situation has changed and we want to terminate her employment.

She makes errors and isn't being serious about them. When questioned, she states she must not have been paying attention. The last couple months we've been tracking her errors, yesterday she made a $4k error. There have not been any write ups. Her manager is on LOA, the GM too busy, and the lead is not capable. What are the risks of terminating her without going through a warning process?

I told her to take the weekend to think about it and get back to me next week. I'm not sure if I need to address this with the manager but my brother, co-owner, thinks I should. What are your thoughts?

1	We hire seasonal janitorial staff every year during our busy summer months. How do we avoid paying unemployment for those individuals that we use in this manner each year? If we classify as seasonal and hire May-Oct every year and say under the 120 days, would we be guaranteed to avoid having them be eligible for unemployment benefits?

How should we manage that?	
5	Employee was supposed to work on Sunday. He told us he made plans and was going to be late. Initially it was going to be 2 hours late, then it turned into a disagreement on why he should be working. While we were gone, he dropped all his things at our door. Leases, bags, keys to client houses, etc. Left him messages but he is now not responding. We think he has resigned and want to make sure to do the right thing.	
0	We offer paid vacation to our employees. This is not earned, and generally granted during certain times of the year, such as Christmas. Is this required to be paid out at time of termination?

5	We have an employee based in FLORIDA that is not working out for the company. He has only been written up once for time-sheet issues but nothing more or anything related to the reason why he isn't working out.

5	I have a full time employee and tomorrow is his last day of full time status and he is going down to seasonal status. Full time marketing to seasonal in harvest. Since he is changing status, do I need to pay him tomorrow like he is terminating?

1	Submitted by Doreen at BBI on behalf of Lynne of BBI and client Norfield Associates: I was wondering if you could help me with an issue that has come up regarding deducting advanced vacation pay from an employees last check when they terminate employment? Currently if an employee leaves the company voluntarily or involuntarily we deduct any advanced vacation time from their final paycheck. I checked with the DOL and this seems like it is something we are permitted to do if we have the policy in writing and the employee is aware of our policy. We have this stated in our employee agreements. The DOL also indicated we should check with the laws of Massachusetts to make sure they dont have any laws against doing this. I wasnt sure if you had any information on this? PLEASE LOG THIS ISSUE UNDER NORFIELD ASSOCIATES - DO NOT CONTACT THE CLIENT - PLEASE EMAIL RESPONSE TO lynne@bbibenefits.com WE ARE THE BROKER.	
5	Spoke to unregistered people ops. We had a part time intern in accounting and we let him go abruptly. It appears that the termination was a surprise because he sent us a long letter about it. How should we have handled this differently?	
1	We have an employee who gave notice today. The manager is saying we don't need the notice and they want to let them go today. I believe we have to pay them through the notice date.	
1	We have an exempt employee who terminated mid-week. Are we obligated to pay that employee for the full week?	
5	An employee has been out 1+ year on a comp claim. He hired an attorney & yesterday Comp's attorney deposed the employee w/ me present. The employee said he wanted his job back last week in a private mtg with me and my partner and we said no due to the limitations from QME making it impossible to do the job. At the Depo our attorney asked if he wanted to come back, employee said, "Yes." Attorney "Could you perform your duties as press operator with the limitations from from QME, no lifting over 10lbs, no changing levels, no bending at waist and able to stand and sit at will?" Dennis "No." " Do you think the company can make accommodations to your job?" Dennis, "No." Off the record employee came to me and asked if I could lay him off or do whatever so he could get accrued vacation and unemployment. Sure. My question is simply how do I describe the departure? Laid off? Thanks as always, Steve	
4	When she left we interviewed someone else and we hired this gal and she started yesterday and the controller worked with her today and said that she has to go. Is two days enough time to make this determination?	
5	We terminated an employee for job abandonment as he requested leave for incarceration and legal needs following release. We permitted use of paid-time off benefits and additional time; however the employee failed to return or call on the date scheduled back. He was a three day no-call, no-show. He has applied for UI benefits and we are in the process of preparing our appeal. We do have a letter from the former employee that denotes the reason for leave, and duration. It was mentioned in his appear there may have been medical issues which we were not apprised of. How do we respond?	
6	In regards to the distribution of a final check in California - can we ask the employee at the start of their employment to agree that their final check will be distributed via direct deposit? Also, the direct deposit takes two days to process before the employee will receive the funds. If we initiate a direct deposit payment on an employee's last day of employment, would that violate CA's same day payment policy?	
4	We have an EE that did a no-chow no-call to their shift. We cut her final check and had it ready for pick up. We have not been able to contact her since Feb 15th? What would be the next step on how we need to get her check to her? Should we mail it to her? Or send it to the state for safe keeping?	
5	I have an exempt employee that resigned recently, He gave us 2 weeks notice, however, he has been very negative and is affecting the department. His last day is March 2, we would like to let him go on February 27 (3 days before his last day). Do we have to pay him until March 2, or can we pay him until February 27 and make that his last day? Another question, we have an open position for a Trainer, we know who we want to promote from one of our current employees, Should we still post the job internally for 5 days so other employees can apply for the position?	
4	Today I have to let somebody go. We are trying to pay the person through the 28th. When is final pay due? How long do we have to give severance? My boss wants to pay the severance around March 6th or 7th - is this allowable? Can you guide me through what to say? She does not have the skill set we thought she did and she is asking for work from home, on the train, and other concessions.	
4	I have an employee that is missing a lot of work due to her daughter being sick. can we wright her up and if she continues can we term her position?	
5	We have an employee who separated from our company on 2/15. At the time of separation, he owed us PTO/sick time. The way we handle it and track earned time and get employee balances of earned time, every time they take earned time theyre given a ledger and theyre asked to sign off and it clearly states that all time is based on 12 months of service and if you do not work the full 12 months, your check will be adjusted to reflect the correct balance. This employee had gone 48 hours of negative on the day he had quit. He had worked during the pay period 46.75 hours, we cut a paycheck to him but didnt deliver it to him because we became aware of his balance. We are drafting a letter to him telling him what had happened. We could send him the letter, am I supposed to provide him with a paycheck showing the hours he worked, then show the negative hours deducted from his hours, therefore showing no pay and no taxes. Do we not have to send him a paycheck at all?	
1	When we lay someone off, do we offer COBRA and cancel their benefits?	
2	At what point can we terminate for job abandonment? Do you have a sample termination letter for job abandonment?

1	Do we need to collect a timecard for an exempt employee who is terminating?	
3	In the case of a commissioned sales person with no employment contract - in the event they are terminated, I want to confirm that legally they need to be paid out any commissions closed prior to the termination date in the state of Missouri, correct? There would be no circumstance aside from an employment contract stating otherwise, signed by the employee that would give the company the legal right to withhold paying out these commissions to the ex employee for any reason? Correct?	
4	We are getting ready to severance an employee. We found out her PTO accrual is off significantly because she went from FT to PT and her accrual was not changed to reflect the new work hours. She only works 4 hours a week. She is 75 years old and has been with the company for 20 years. The extra accrual means she has a whole year accrued. Im trying to figure out if I should just pay out the vacation, even though it is wrong. I was thinking about giving her one month of severance plus her vacation time.	
3	We have had two employees who passed away this year. One passed away last week. Her sister advised that she passed away and noted they were not sure what they needed to do to get her final paycheck. Should the employer send a letter in this regard?	
5	We are an Electric Distributor, in Colorado, with 96 employees. We discovered an employee, in the role of Assistant Warehouse Manager, a non-exempt position, was logging into the electronic timekeeping system and changing his clock in/outs for the last 7 months, padding 15 minutes most morning up to an hour and a half last Friday (all with date/time stamps indicating he changed them). We would like to add up the time he falsified and withhold the cost from his last paycheck. He has 18 days of PTO that will be paid out, in addition to 40 hours of time worked. However, he also has several garnishments to take into account. Please provide me guidance on how or if we can do this legally. Thank you, Stephani Ritter	
4	We have a manager at one of our California locations that we are going to let go as it is not a fit/working. We will not have the final check in hand. We would like to provide her a release letter for severance. And consider her final day would be next Friday and she said she would get the severance. The individual is over age 40. If we say we consider her last day the following Friday and PAY her through that date, is that acceptable.	
4	We have a stylist that works for us and she also just opened her own Great Clips salon. We would like to terminate her because we fear that she may steal cash or product from us as a way to get her shop started. We have another stylist who is also going to work for the new shop owner. We may terminate her too. We are in OR. What are the rules in Oregon?	
5	We terminated an employee for tardiness. He'd been written up multiple times including a couple of suspensions. He called me today to tell me that he's told his supervisor that he needs to change his shift due to the disability he incurred with military service.	
5	Just wanted to follow-up on the conversation we had last week. He called and went off - I called him. My PTSD was acting up. Stated his manager "doesn't give a fuck about me." He no showed no called 3 days. He was in a rage. I said maybe, this isn't the best work environment for you. He said he wished us luck and hung up. How do I close this out?	
2	A client that employs about 12 people will be eliminating 3 positions. Do you have any severance agreement templates. Friday is their payroll day. Final paychecks will be ACH, or do they need to cut manual checks? Does the vacation payout need to be a separate check? Should there be a wage statement? Do you have a sample severance agreement - what are the consideration rules?	
6	If a former employee request a letter stating their last day of work for the company and the date they received their final check are we as a company required to do that or can we choose if we want to do it?	
0	We are laying off employees. Must we pay out their vacation in one lump sum or can we stretch it out over several payments.	
5	We run biweekly payroll. The employee who we called about earlier only came in on 20th but then he was suspended. When he came back to work today, he showed up before his shift and was immediately fired. Do I owe him reporting time pay?	
5	An employee with performance issues, manager broke things down very clearly in an email following their meeting about his performance. He is an older worker but when they talked he didn't seem to have any response to his write-up or plan for improving. Can we terminate?	
6	We have an employee who used the company credit card for personal use and he has now given his notice. Can we take it out of his final check?	
4	We have an employee that is on a 90-Day probation due to attendance. The agreement is if the employee has more than 3 infractions ( Unscheduled absences, tardiness, or unscheduled early leaves) between JAN 16, 2017 to May 19, 2017, the employee will be terminated immediately. The employee has not shown up to work the last three days.The employee's partner did call the manager and said she did have personal issues and tried to commit suicide (something we cannot validate). Because the employee hasn't called us directly for her absence, can we consider this unexcused and terminate? How long do we give to get us documentation of the leave? If documentation is not provided, what is our next step?	
2	I searched but I couldn't find a Notice to Employee Change in Relationship form. It's a form one is supposed to provide to en employee upon discharge - whether it's a termination or resignation. Do you have one? Perhaps I'm not looking in the right place. We're in California.	
4	What are the rules determining if an employee has quit or not? We have an employee that has been gone for 2 1/2 weeks, but she does send a text every morning saying why she can't come in. First her mother was sick (she has told me her mother has cancer previously). Then her 8 month-old baby was sick, and now she is sick. We are really slow right now, so we don't have enough for her to do right now anyway, but I'm wondering.... does this constitute as her quitting?	
6	We have an employee whose last day is today. We are trying to complete his final pay and he is paid $1000 in commissions and the rest is paid off the financial statement. That is also how we determine his vacation. How would we ensure compliance with final pay rules in this case?	
6	We are in the process of completing Form UC 61. Our teachers are paid 185 hours, what do I enter relating to final wages in item "K"?

6	From : kelewski@stp-sf.org Subject : deceased employee's parent wants to cash final check ~ Are there any barriers to the employee's parents receiving his final check? It was sent to the parents' residence because that was emergency contact on file. HR unable to reach employee for over a week. A month later, we learned the employee was deceased. The employee's father told me he tried to deposit the check but the bank would not allow it because the check is in his son's name. The check is the last pay and vacation leave provided at we considered voluntary resignation for no show/no call for over three days. I'm not sure we can re-issue a payroll check to a parent.

5	Hello, We had an employee who gave a two week notice on 05/23/17 and today has stated that tomorrow would be his last day instead. Since his last day is now tomorrow and not 06/06/17 does he need to be given his last pay check at the end of his shift tomorrow or does I have until Thursday to pay him his final check? I reviewed the ORS but I still wasn't sure when to pay him to be in compliance since he informed us today that tomorrow would be his last day. Thank you!	
4	I have an employee that came to me and she said if we do not have anything for her that was less stressful that she wanted to resign and today she called and said that she is going out on disability. Can we accept her resignation?

1	We had someone we are considering terminating. My boss mentioned something about laying them off. Lay off verse release, can you help me understand the difference? This person is the GM of restaurant and is making derogatory comments about the restaurant to the employees. We are going to combine this position with another one and eliminate the role.	
4	We hired someone and theyve only gone through the training period, we have a 60 day period where we decide if its a good fit. We found some things out that cause us to believe this is not a good fit for numerous reasons: namely around references who told us that she was termed from last jobs for not disclosing information relevant to the safety of performing her position (medical info). Our staff offers care for others and the individual must be able to provide direct one-on-one care for another person. We are concerned that she was not up front about her situation. She said she could perform the job, and we started her training, but are now hearing via references that she was termed because she could not. Additionally, she is a safety concern both for herself and our clients. We are in UT. We would like to terminate her employment. Can we do that since we are an at-will state?	
3	4. What is the best process for letting someone go with minimal exposure to unemployment benefits?	
3	Carolyn, Here is my working bonus benefit. It is based on the numbers of hours worked during the last 6 months, there is no accommodation for prorating the bonus. I could figure it out using the entire 6 months instead of her termination date. Another question can I add to the policy : To qualify employees must be employed on June 1st to receive the mid year bonus and on December 1st to qualify for the year end bonus. 6.8 Working Bonus Benefit All full-time employees are eligible for a Working Bonus benefit after six months of continuous time employment. For purposes of qualifying for the Working Bonus t he anniversary date is the 1 st of the month after being hired. The working bonus is paid to employees twice during a year with the first pay in June and the first pay in December. Employees A Working Bonus is calculated according to the following Tenure schedule: Length of Tenure Tenure Rate 0 months - 6 Months None 7 months - 24 months .75 days per month 25 months - 36 months .83 days per month Note: Maximum of 5 days per bonus payout The Working Bonus is calculated by totaling the hours worked for the 6 month period and determining a daily average using a 5 .5 day week times the T enure Rate . The bonus does not include overtime hours nor holiday hours. For example, if the employee worked a total of 850 hours between the first pay in June through the last pay in November , this would be an average of 32.69 hours per week. Based on a standard, five and 12 -day wor kweek, the employee averaged 5.94 hours per day. The average hours per day is then multiplied by the Tenure R ate to determine the hours per qualifi ed month. In this example, 5.94 is multiplied by .75 ( Tenure Rate ), to equal 4.5 hours . 4.5 hours multiplied by 6 months = 26.74 hours . ( iss. 10 /2 5/2011 ) For the monthly bonus we do not have a written policy just the attached spreadsheet. It is based on monthly results so there is no method for prorating as the manager left 1/2 way through the month. thanks for looking into this for me, Feeel free to call me if it is easier to talk this through.	
5	Thank you for your reply but I am still no clear. I read the ORS's and wasn't certain and is why I emailed asking for clarification. He originally gave his notice on 05/23 and then today stated tomorrow would be his last day. Do I consider today his notice date that he is last day is tomorrow and that is less than 48 hours and I pay him out within 5 business days or do I go with his original notice dates of the 23rd and need to pay him out at the end of his shift tomorrow?	
3	Is there a liability for an employer for providing a reference check for a former employee?	
1	I have an employee that transports patients to and from our organization for medical appointments in our company van. A person was upset because our employee cut him off on the highway so the person video taped our employee going 75 miles per hour in a 65 mile per hour zone with a patient in the van. We currently do not have a policy on speeding in an organization vehicle. The manager would like to terminate the employee. We do not have a progressive discipline policy in place. Do you think we owe this employee a written warning first since there isn't a policy in place on speeding or do you think we are fine to terminate the employee.	
5	Unregistered User: Alex Markov, Red Key Solutions, amarkov@redkeysolutions.com, 9143157056 We are doing a termination this week. A person was with us less than 60 days. His skills were not represented properly. In general, he was rude to his manager which is not acceptable. He fumbled multiple projects and was insubordinate. We decided that we want to go as of the 31st. We want to give him two weeks pay and keep his insurance through the end of the month.

6	If I have an employee who prefers direct deposit for their final check. Is the date of transmission considered the date when we issue the check, or is the date that the earnings fund the bank account? If I have staff who are compensated on an hourly basis and who give 72 hours notice of their intention to quit, but we cannot confirm their actual hours worked until the end of the shift, at which time we do not have anyone to prepare and sign the final check, is it legal to issue it the following day? If I am required to issue final check to someone who quit with no notice, is the 72 hours to prepare their check calculated in terms of business days, or possibly not? I ask because my HR department only works Monday-Friday.	
1	We have an employee that has been on probation for the last 120 days and is still not performing how we would like. Instead of terminating her for non performance, the managers would like to eliminate her position and move some of the work load to a new position under another manager along with approximately 50% other duties. She will be allowed to apply for the newly created position however, it is unlikely she will be qualified based on her current work performance. Are there any legal issues we need to be aware of going into this? Are there requirements for position elimination in one area and then shifting some of the workload to another area. Are there percentage of job duty requirements? I would assume we could not shift 80% of the job duties and call it a new position. Please call me if you need additional information. 404-504-8317 Kimberly Russo-Alesi 9:00AM - 4:00PM EST

There's concerns from ownership that terminating him, there's too many ways for him to get into the system. Get some buy in "we're working with you."

2	Hello, Our current employment contract does not state a 90 day probation period for exempt and / or non-exempt employees. We have the following: *TERMINATION* a. Employment at Will Your Employment shall be at-will, meaning that either you or the Company shall be entitled to terminate your Employment at any time and for any reason, with or without cause. Any contrary representations that may have been made to you shall be superseded by this Agreement. This Agreement shall constitute the full and complete agreement between you and the Company on the at-will nature of your Employment, which may only be changed in an express written agreement signed by you and a duly authorized officer of the Company. My question is the following: Can we terminate an employee within 90 days without a clause in the offer agreement?

5	Weird situation....i have an employee who started Dec 19, 2016. On Jan 20, 2017 he was injured in a job related accident. He went for WC treatment and failed the drug screen. He has not been back to work yet and to my knowledge has not been released for return to work or officially terminated. The WC claim was denied on Feb 14 after I finally rec'd the drug screen results. He has not been back to work since the accident. We paid him for the date of the accident and the following week (Since he did not have PTO accrued). Are we able to set a retroactive term date for this employee? If he were still actively working, he would be eligible for benefits so i need to either offer benefits or issue a term date prior to his eligiblity. What advice can you offer

He feels that people should be suspended and he hung up on me. He is also upset about an employee that was terminated who he feels was talked about. He brought this to our attention today and we are investigating his allegations. Can we terminate him early if we substantiate that he did in fact speak to the client?	
5	Issue Flor entered yesterday. I have a client, Richard Yeh of Thundersoft America, who is getting ready to terminate an employee. The employee was hired to generate revenue with sales targets as a team and as an individual. He has been under performing in his sales responsibilities. The employee was hired in October 2015, and his offer letter included at-will and severance package clauses. Sales expectations were set upon his hire and throughout his employment. The last discussion was at the end of the year when the sales team didn't meet their revenue goals, and he didn't contribute enough on his own. He was told that he needed to improve this year. There's been modest improvement in the last couple of months, but he's still under performing. Rich wants guidance on terminating the employee to avoid any discrimination or legal issues.

The owners want to giver her some money but required she sign a confidentiality agreement.

We recently had an employee challenge this and she made reference to a 9th Circuit case. Please advise. Thank you!	
5	I have an employee who has an offer letter that states the "at-will" nature of his employment. However, he was also given a 2 year contract. At this moment he holds the position of Director for one of our smaller companies. The position is going to be eliminated due to high overhead and the cost of running the business vs profitability. What are we able to do with his position if it is being eliminated? What is the standard severance package or the requirements of payment when he has 5 months left in his contract? What are the exposures to eliminated the position prior to the 2 year agreement? What are the notice requirements? 30 days? etc.	
4	We are a junk removal and moving company. I recently terminated a move consultant (move estimator) for poor performance. Her job was to go to client sites in advance and provide an estimate of time/cost. She was only with us for a few weeks and had underestimated several moving jobs causing employee satisfaction issues and significant client satisfaction issues. She was making $10 per hour (which is over minimum wage), and was also getting 3% commission on booked moves once the job was completed. It was in writing that if estimates were 30% or more off actual time/cost, that we do not pay commissions. There were several of those that we will not pay commissions to her. However, there are still several jobs that have not come to fruition. Do I need to keep her on the payroll to pay her commissions on those jobs once they are completed.	
5	One of our store managers has not been making the cash deposits as needed. While we have no written procedure of the requirement, it is a known verbal understanding that our managers have. We believe that he has stolen the money and we also believe that he has stolen store inventory, because we saw photos of his own store on the internet with our inventory in that store. We are going to terminate him upon his return from vacation. But in the meantime, we have shut down his email access. Can you advise?

2	Do you have any forms/notices that can or should be used when a company needs to furlough an exempt employee? And should all employees (1 exempt and 3 non) receive a Change of Status notice?	
6	I'm calculating a final check today. The employee came in at 10 am and we are terminating her at 2 pm. Do we have to pay any additional reporting time pay?	
5	An employee has been making careless mistakes. He's been issued warnings and his final was issued today. He became very aggressive and argumentative. We suspended so we could consider our next step. What should we write as the reason for termination and final discipline?	
3	If an employee (company temporary or regular) is terminated, is it unlawful for the company to disclose the details of the termination to the staff? For example: employee was released because their temp assignment was over. Or, should the information stay general for example: company had to make staff adjustments accordingly due to business changes?

0	Can you help me understand the TX laws on the payout of Sales Commissions for an employee released due to performance issues? Our sales commission plan states that you must be employed on the day of the payout to qualify for commission payout. This individual will not be employed on that day. Are we required to pay out this commission based upon TX law? If we do have to pay, can we pay out on the normally scheduled commission payroll date? It would be difficult to pay within 6 days because commissions are only calculated once a month upon receipt of customer payments. Thank you!

The employee has called out sick since the decision was made and is unavailable to terminate. Today June 2nd he notified his manager that he is seeking treatment for drug addiction. They are still wanting to terminate his employment, but should a consideration be made for treatment since that could technically fall in the category of FMLA?

4	Employer is laying off a long term employee however they would like to give her two weeks notice and offer her 6 months of separation pay for remaining with the company to transition her position during those two weeks; is this ok? If she refuses to stay would this then be a resignation?	
4	Former employee is going to be rehired and employer made an offer the got disturbing news that multiple residents have made threats against her, of violence and against her life.

4	Employee resigned, and the company asked her to stay for a transition period. We agreed to a flexible schedule and that we would continue her salary and benefits. Should I put this in writing? She wants to move on and the company needs her to be involved but wants her to sign a release. I think that would be a slap in the face.	
5	An employee will be retiring in the next several weeks. He has asked that his last day of work be June 20 but that the remaining dates he wants to use his PTO, so his last date of employment would actually be a few weeks later. We do not have a policy on this, how should we manage?

5	Employee on Medical Leave. Could you please offer your perspective on the following? We have an employee who has been out on a non-FMLA medical leave since Jan 9, 2017. He has paid his insurance premiums through 01/15/17 through his final pay check. Effective 01/09/17 he was approved to collect short term disability benefits until 02/13/17. During his medical leave he is responsible to mail in his contributions to keep his benefit plans in place. On his last day of employment (before leaving on his medical leave), He was provided with a payment plan to keep his coverages active and intact. Despite sending him texts, emails and phone calls, he has rarely contacted us and he has not yet returned to work, requested an extension of his leave, nor has he made his required medical payments. At this point we are assuming he has abandoned his position. If we terminate his employment what date would you recommend? 02/13/17 (the last date he was approved for short term disability) or 01/15/17 ( the last date he made his required payment for his medical coverages)

5	What are the potential issues that can arise in this situation? - accidentally offered a vacation package to a new employee that was at a higher level than his position was entitled to. The difference is 2 days, and the 'lower' package was 3 days sick (no carry over) 5 days vacation, while the 'higher" package was 10 days combined sick and PTO. - told newhire after he accepted offer and HR explained the mistake. He verbally accepted the new offer and the signature used was the "old" signature tied to the previous offer. He was also told that if he had questions about it, or was unsettled about it, to approach HR. Next day he sends HR a note saying he is not accepting the new package, and wants to be paid as an independent contractor. - HR offered to revert to the original offer. He declined. HR then informs him they will pay him the agreed upon rate for the day he worked. He's now arguing the offer was null and void after the information was presented to him.

5	We terminated an employee yesterday and I escorted him out. A few moments later he came back and demanded to speak to his supervisors boss. I escorted him out of the building again and asked him to send the boss an email. He said I did send an email and that is why I'm standing outside the door. I told him it was inappropriate behavior. At first he wanted to wait in the parking lot. He eventually left. He has been calling everyone he can to try and talk about this. I told him he had his chance to tell me his view when I was walking him out the first time. The boss is busy and getting ready to travel. I'm thinking we let this guy wait so he can calm down before he speaks to the boss. He claimed he is perfect and his manager sucks. The second time I walked him out he started talking about wrongful termination and personal attack. The email said the personal attack was that his supervisor was asking him to put his cell phone away.

1	I wanted to run something by another HR person. We began observing that on our truck driver logs two employees, male and female, we always stopping at the same location, arriving at the same time and if late they were both late for up to 2 hours. The male employee was suspended for an accident he but we observed them meet at a spot and he got in the truck with her and we assume when on her route without authorization to be there, to work or to tag along while someone else is working. Employees are made aware that at time we will place tracking devices on the trucks, we did this with these two and found they were basically having some type of relationship. We're not interested in that but feel there is fraud as their routes are equally longer than the time we're allowed to bill the client and his riding along while suspended. It's not appropriate and want to terminate both. Do you see any risk here?	
1	I just wanted to talk something through with someone. It' regarding a theoretical conversation based on when someone intends to resign in the future.

Never stated that he has a medical condition or that he needs an accommodation. When he was told that he may be in jeopardy of losing his job, he said "why, because of my age?" This has nothing to do with his age, it has to do with his overall poor work performance. Just want to walk through this case as we plan on terminating him on Monday. We will be calling it a lay off, and will not backfill the position. Thoughts?

1	If we were to continue to have issues with this employee? How do we go about firing them?	
3	If the division of a company is closing, and an employee in that division is on work comp leave, is the employer able to terminate the employee?	
4	I have an employee who stepped on a nail and had to go to the hospital and she was instructed to go to her primary care doctor she went to work at another site. She was there from noon until 4 pm. She went and then gave me a notice from the provider. She was asked to report to a location because she felt uncomfortable. This employee, outside of WC, has been a challenge. She is willfully challenging her manager at every term and she is not grasping how to use tools and fix fixtures. Can we terminate her?	
1	We have 3 employees that were in an auto accident on Friday night. Two of them passed away. It was in Mexico. We owe them for a week. How do we go about handling that? Their address is in the US. They have no family here.	
2	An employee accepted a Severance pkg after being given the option of the package, or being placed on a 30 day PIP for poor performance. In completing the Separation notice, would this be considered a voluntary resignation or involuntary separation due to performance?	
4	We had an employee who received her check on Thursday. She has requested to have the following Friday off, but then she said she didn't need it. However, on that Friday she didn't show up. The bank called the doctor and said that the signature on the employee's check did not look authentic. The doctors then asked his wife if she had signed it and she said no, that she must have forgotten. We suspect the employee forged the doctor's signature to cash her check. What do we do at this point?	
4	We have an employee who has been with us for a year . She requested FMLA leave for two weeks. The doctor's note looked like she filled it out, and then just had the doctor sign it. We allowed her the time off but upon her return she is not performing, looking for other jobs while working, and has been absent. Once absence she stated her child was sick but then her father called looking for her and stated the child was not. She has now called in last night stating that she woke up and believes she was drugged and raped. We then received a weird call from someone identifying themselves as an advocate for her and stating the employee was afraid she was going to be fired. We had already come to the decision to terminate employment after the last call out as that would have been her third and final write up. We have performance reviews in two weeks. Should we move to terminate now?	
4	We have an ex employee who was termed from the salon she worked at, she now comes into the salon and trys to cause a scene. She has been asked to leave and not return to the salon. She now says she has every right to come in there and that she hasn't done anything. She isn't there getting a service. She said her lawyer says to ban her from the salon we have to serve her legal documentation. I thought any establishment could refuse service to anyone as long as we don't discriminate. She is just trying to cause problems with the rest of the employees due to her being termed for insubordination.	
5	In another situation we have an employee that was injured at his home. He didn't tell anyone for a few days and just didn't show up. He is payed on salary so for the past three weeks we have been using his sick and vacation time even though he didn't ask us to. Is that ok? And is it ok if we don't pay him next pay period if he doesn't show up? Also, at what point is it job abandonment? (Issue 2 of 2)	
6	It has to do with final pay. Employee was termed and we mailed the check for delivery but employee has not updated the new address. Do we have to pay extra because of the penalties?	
6	An employee had signed a loan agreement stating that we can deduct from his final wages any balance of his loan if his employment is ended. We are terminating him today and he still owes $200. Can we deduct the full $200 from his final check?	
6	We have an employee is California and today is her last day of employment. We have paid her final wages in accordance with CA labor laws. However, we did not pay her out the bonus. Bonus is paid out on the 15th and last day of the month based on store performance. Can we pay this on the 15th?	
1	Termination/restructuring we have 4 schools and one is going away, it happens to be the oldest campus. We are going to restructure and try and save as many teachers as possible. We are basing our decision on who to let go on longevity. We have a newer office manager, and we are going to let her go. We will only need three principals now but we have two that we want to get rid of. One of the principals with performance issues is African American. She also has experience in special education. May we offer her a special ed position? If she doesn't want this other position should we still process the layoff? Another campus, also has a principal with performance issues and we were planning to RIF him too. This will leave us with only 2 principals for 3 campuses. We are considering having the CEO be the active principal at one of the campuses.	
4	We have a new hire, within her 90 days. She has been sent home a few times due to medical issues. She also has exhibited strange behavior (sleepiness, slurred speech, very low/high energy levels). Friday, we decided we were going to terminate her based on her erratic behavior. Today she did not show up at 11 for her shift. She called an hour later to say she was recovering from a "surgical procedure" and "may" be coming in late. We would like to go ahead with the termination but I do not want to expose the company to possible problems because of her medical issues. Please advise

5	we had a tower climber working for us that fell about 35 feet he did not have any injuries. ER released him that day and we had him get checked out again by a dr in box location and they said light duty for a week. He finally admitted he unclipped which caused him to fall. At what point can i terminate him for violating company policy for unclipping?	
5	Specific to Hawaii. I have an employee that advised me he will be departing from the company. He has not given me a specific end date. We need to keep that location fully staffed due to government regulations. Can I give him two weeks notice or do I need to wait for him to advise me? He is a salaried employee.	
1	We are considering terminating an employee for tardies without calling out. We have a letter we want to send to him giving him two options. He can be terminated and receive three weeks severance Leave at the end of the school year with no severance (June 19th) Can we do both options?	
2	Termination letter to employee and would like to read it to you for a second opinion.	
6	We are issuing an employee his final paycheck. He owes money to the company. May we deduct the amount he owes from his final paycheck?	
5	We are in Massachusetts and have an employee who just gave his resignation. He currently has used 6 more hours of vacation time (PTO) than he has accrued for the year. Can we deduct the time he owes us from his final pay? Do we have to get his signature?

5	Hi there, I am trying to get some help on an HR issue. I have an employee that I will be firing for insubordination (this is the third time he has yelled profanities as a fellow employee in the last 8 months). All of this is documented but he also has an open workers comp claim that he is fighting. I just want to make sure I document thoroughly and correctly. Thanks! Morgan

3	Last day paychecks: Our current policy is to pay on the 10 and 25th of the month. We had a question regarding last payment for employees whose last day of work will be on May 18 or May 21 (hourly employees). These individuals in question are not being terminated. They just do not work over the summer. It is possible for us to pay them on the normal payroll policy cycle or do we need to pay them on their "last day?"	
1	I would like your thought on announcing ALL terminations using the following (or similar) language. "Effect [date], [Name of employee] is no longer employed with Citizens Bank. We wish them well in their new endeavors." Would this put us at any risk with employees involuntarily terminated? Also, what do you consider best practice.	
4	I have a situation with an employee. She cost the company $10K in errors over the last 60 days and received a final warning. We found out Friday she cost us another $1500. She is also on a work permit and she has been updating it but as it turns out the last day of her current permit is tomorrow. She knows tomorrow that she is coming in and can't work on Wednesday. She has told me that she can't get an extension and has to wait 60 days and her attorney didn't file document in time. Additionally, she is seeing it isn't working out and has expressed wanting to go back to school. Should we terminate her based on the performance or work permit or allow her to resign.

They were talking about a three month probation period in New York; is this required prior to terminating someone?

4	EE hired mid January as a full time employee She has filed for UI claiming part time status. Aside from her fist week of employment and a week she was out sick, she has been working full time.

He is insubordinate, and we want to let him go today. What forms must he receive, and what reason may I provide for reason for termination?	
4	We discovered that the employee who is now on the ADA leave did not have a college bachelors degree when we received an anonymous tip on FB via messenger. We checked the transcript and discovered that she only had a associated degree. Once she has returned from her leave, can we move forward with terminating her. We have contracts with the city/state that require that people in this position have a bachelors degree.

4	I have an employee who has told us she's dealing with some mental health issues. We were not aware of why she missed her time punches on Saturday and then no-call/no-showed on Monday. We made several attempts to reach her to make sure she was okay (HR & mgr). I finally received a written response confirming she had worked on Sat. and that she had missed Monday due to mental health. I asked her to call. Then I received a call from the HHS requesting confirmation of this employee's termination date. I was surprised and explained I was attempting to speak with her and that I had not terminated. The employee was on the call and when I asked did you resign or are you resigning she simply said yes. Now she's coming back saying I owe her commissions but based on our policy I don't. Please confirm I'm addressing this properly.	
2	We are going to terminate someone tomorrow. We need to see if there is a difference in the severance agreement and rules for someone who is under age 40. If so, can you please send that information and a sample severance and release agreement?	
5	It has to do with an unemployment insurance claim and we have 10 days to respond. We received a claim from an employee who was dismissed because he was on a medical leave of absence.

4	We terminate an employee last week. We let her because she is hard to work with, lots of drama, instability in team. What are the risks? Do you think she can make an allegation for implied promise of continued employment?	
4	We are performing a termination to day. We have phone records to support the cause for the termination but there has been some peculiar activity around the employee. Further the customer to whom the employee was rude has provided us with a detailed account of what occurred. I'm concerned because although the employee was asked about the event the day after it's occurrence she is now saying that she knew nothing about it and it was not her. What if it was not her? I want to talk this through with somebody.	
1	I received a previous employment questionnaire that asks about a previous employees history.

Coincidentally she's been out all week sick. Is there any risk in still proceeding with her lay off?

5	Employee separated from company recently and management stated that reason for separation was due to poor work performance. EE wrote back and said that is not true, he claims that he voluntarily resigned because he was offered a transfer to another position and he did not want it. I spoke to management and they agreed, he was offered, and declined a transfer, but the transfer was offered because of his poor job performance in a sales role. How should I manage this? Should we reclassify this as a voluntary resignation?	
3	Can a company terminate an employee for simply stating that their services are no longer needed? What risks, if any, do we open ourselves up to?

4	Good Afternoon, We had to let an employee go this week due to some performance issues and restructuring of the company. The owner has allowed her to continue working through the month on a flexible schedule to give her time to look for a new position. With that, she has asked for a letter of separation now. Typically I would not complete one until the last day. Should I go ahead and give her a letter of separation dated for her last day of employment, 6/30/17, or wait until then? Thanks! ~Cassandra

4	I have an employee who just started last week and she has been out more than she has worked. The other day we discussed the proper procedures to calling in sick and having to speak with a person directly. So far, she has been a no show, no call. How many days does it have to be a no show no call before we can terminate? This is a continuation of a previous issue https://rockstars.thinkhr.com/portal/basic.php?thePage=issues/issue_profile.php&issueID=322381	
1	We are looking at terminating an employee and using the cause of at-will preferring not to go into much more than at-will and we no longer think it is a good fit. What if the employee wants to know more? Do they need to put it into writing to request more details? We do not have anything documented in the employee's file, but know that a main customer has asked not to work with this employee and that budgets/organization are never within expectations.	
5	We planned on terminating an employee. His termination was scheduled and we were suddenly visited by OSHA about some potential violations in the room this employee works in. They told us it was an anonymous call. I'm concerned that if we terminate, if it was him, he'll come back and say we terminated due to that OSHA call. What are your thoughts?	
4	We promoted an employee from our San Antonio office to become our HR Manager and then at our request, she transferred her and her family to our corporate office in Seattle. She is failing at the job, costing us money and increasing our liability by not properly managing our benefits and WC costs. She is pregnant with her 3rd child and her husband does not work. But we cannot keep her on any longer. We would like to let her go and offer her a comfortable severance. She is a smart young woman, but is in over her head in the management of HR for a company our size. Can we discuss?	
1	We are terminating an employee in MA tomorrow. What is the process for that state?	
3	May we enter July 1 as an employee's last date of employment so that they may continue their health benefits for July, even though July 1 would not have been a working day?	
4	I needed some guidance. I have an employee who is claiming unemployment and I did several verbal warnings to this employee and she did not improve and then what I did was I wrote her up and she refused to sign and review the doc. She became very defensive and I left this alone. Then I found out that she left 10 mins later than me (11:30 AM and she was supposed to work until 6 PM) She was a no call no show the next day. Based on our policy, that is considered voluntary termination. Filling out the unemployment application I want to be clear on what to fill out if it is fired or quit.	
6	If a former employee reports in to collect their final wages - is this considered hours worked?	
5	Situation #1: I have an employee in Florida who had problems and we transferred him to another property. He claimed he was installing a microwave and began having arm pain (a pinch). He filed a claim and he received healthcare. He was released to modified duty until next physician's visit. We had too many on the job problems; he was working very half-hearted so we told him we couldn't accommodate anymore. We placed him on leave. He went to an urgent care on his own and then claimed he had back and knee pain. I forwarded information to the adjuster. Employee was seen by doctor and released to full duty in 5/18. We have not seen or heard from him since and I was going to terminate him. We really don't want to keep him on - his manager tried to contact him and we sent him information on the FMLA and he hasn't responded. Now today he emailed me information and a statement about his pain.	
5	We discovered that an employee was falsifying documents. A meeting was called with the employee and his immediate supervisor to address and confront the employee regarding this issue. The employee acknowledge that he was falsifying documents. The employee was suspended for three (3) days without pay and also placed on a six (6) month probation. After careful consideration, we were considering terminating the employee upon his return from his suspension. This return to work could jeopardize the program and relationship with the funding source if he is allowed to return. The following day after the employee was suspended he presented a medical leave notice from his doctor that took him off work for thirty (30) days until 6/29/17, which was an overlap of his suspension period. When this employee returns from his medical leave on can he be terminated or do we have to allow him to return to work. What remedies do you suggest to address this situation. Your advice is appreciated	
1	We have 2 locations that we operate out of and just acquired a 3rd. We have a position at our 1st location that we wish to eliminate as the position can be better served at the newest location by someone existing there. How would this termination be "termed"? A layoff? It's not a matter of us having issued warnings etc just that the position will be duplicated and we're choosing to keep the other individual. The individual that who's position would eliminated at the 1st location is a white male aged 59. Let me know your thoughts. Thanks!	
1	We just had an employee meeting with a group of about 7 employees to discuss a change in policy / procedure related to shift change overs. One of the LPN's became agitated and argumentative with the nursing supervisor who was sharing the details. She hand wrote a two weeks notice on a piece of scratch paper in front of everyone and SLAMMED it down on the desk in front of everyone and said "I'm giving my 2 weeks notice." Our nursing supervisor immediately escorted her off of the premises. Is this considered a resignation or a termination?	
1	We are a startup med device company and we may have to terminate 3 employees on Friday (confidential information). My boss wants me to be prepared for Friday in case it is going to be their last day. Are we required to pay them final wages that day and do we have to withhold taxes?	
5	We are South Carolina employer and we employee drivers and we had a driver decide he did not want to drive at night and that is part of his duty and we do not want him any longer He was a helper in the past assisting drivers and we are doing away with that role. I need to document this and give it in writing because he will not tender his resignation. It is hard work and he does not want to drive anymore. We promoted him from a helper to driver contingent on him getting a CDL; we offered to pay the cost. He never got his CDL and it was verbalized as a condition of employment. It was not documented that he had to drive at night. The only offer was when he was hired as a helper. How should we proceed?	
1	We are likely terminating a different employee. We may do a 3 day suspension before we terminate to get further information. Do we pay for the hour we talk to the employee? Even if it is a termination meeting?	
0	Hello, I have a question for a company company in Massachusetts with fewer than 50 employees: "The company needs to shut down the entire facility for 4-8 weeks due to construction, so we need to temporarily lay off our entire workforce for that time period. Are we required to pay out all accrued but unused vacation, sick, and other paid time off when the shutdown begins? Or, since this is a temporary shutdown, can we tell employees that we will not pay accrued but unused time off? And what if they request to be paid the time do we have to allow that request? Lastly, can you please confirm that our employees should apply for unemployment during this timeframe? Thank you! Kayla	
4	We have an employee with a serious alcohol dependency problem. After numerous counselings, we have given her the ultimatum of enrolling in a rehab program or risk losing her employment. I am meeting with her tomorrow to discuss her options. Must we pay for the cost of the treatment program? If we are to terminate her, what are the documents that she must be presented with?	
5	Hi, I have an employee who works from home in Texas. He has been on an performance improvement plan soon after he started with us in January 2017. we have extended the PIP because he made improvements but at this point, he is not going to make the improvements necessary. So, we need to terminate him. I have not terminated a person before. So need advice: 1, What is the reason for termination? Nonperformance? Just Cause? Does it matter? 2. Does he qualify for unemployment? 3. do I give him 2 weeks notice? 4. Any guidance is appreciated.	
4	We had an employee quit without notice on the evening of May 26, the Friday before Memorial Day so we had her check ready to pick upon the 30th. She declined to pick it up. She authorized us to mail it to her. We missed the deadline to mail it since she notified us late. We issued another check to pay her through the 31st. We made a copy and took it directly into the post office on 5/31 in the afternoon. We told her on 6/1 that it has been mailed and to please let us know when it was received. She sent an email today to say that she hadnt received it. She said she was going to file a claim with the DOL. We responded by email saying that we had made efforts to get her the pay per the rules. We have proof of mailing.	
3	We have an employee who was hired on a full-time basis in January and under an employment agreement. The agreement was amended in February to permit part-time work. The original agreement retains language requiring 60 days notice of termination. We have decided to terminate as the employee is not fulfilling the duties of the position. This may or may not be lending to the reason for part-time work, to care for an ill spouse. When I process payout for the termination period which amount do I use, the old amount or the new agreed to amount?	
5	I am terminating an employee and wanted to see about the a suspension notice. Sample termination letter. He is the store manager and there were some deposits that were not made. We have not yet spoken to him about this since he was on vacation.	
5	We had an assoicate steal over 300 dollars in maintenance supplies from our hotel by ordering supplies and running to the store and charging on our hotel account. We found out after we terminated him. We took the 354 out of his check and filed a police report . He has told us all along that he did not have the product but then came back to us and said he did have it and now wants to bring it back. Do we have to give him the money we took from his check back .

3	On or about 5/24/17, I emailed concerning an employee of ours who has been off work since March 28, 2017 with laryngitis. On May 25, 2017 Amy Puzder responded and informed me that FMLA paperwork should have been sent by the employer even without the request having been made by the employee. I sent FMLA paperwork to the employee on the 25th of May and requested that they respond acknowledging receipt of the paperwork and or return the completed paperwork to me. I followed up with a second email on 5/31/17 and requested that the employee respond on or before the end of business on 6/2/17. It is now 6/7/17 and we have had no communication from the employee. We would like to proceed with terminating this employee. Are there any other measures that we need to take prior to sending a termination letter via FedEx (signature required) to the employee's home? Thank you, Judy	
1	If we were to let go of someone because services are no longer needed, what would we need to do? We are in TX, and it is an at-will state.	
0	We currently grant vacation, PTO, and floating holidays to employees based on their seniority date. Are employers required to payout these benefits at the time of separation in the state of IL? Thanks	
4	1- We have an employee who has been a no call no show a couple of times. When he left work on Saturday, he was to call us on Sunday to let us know if he'd be in on Monday. Can we terminate him? 2- We have another employee who has been with us for over a year and a one-half. She's had some performance issues. She was hired to be the assistant manager of our cafe. Most recently we had a negative comment card for her from a customer in the cafe stating that she was rude to the customer. We'd also asked that no employee work beyond their normally scheduled shift without proper approval, and she worked over 45 minutes. While we paid her for that time, she did not ask for approval to work over her normal shift. Can we terminate her?	
5	An employee decided not to continue with his employment relationship with the company. I have his final cheque ready and have reached out to him via email asking when he wanted to pick it up or if he would prefer for me to mail it to him. Do i have to wait for a response before I can mail it via certified mail? Thanks, Maria	
3	I have a client that is wanting to terminate an employee. The difficulty is that the employee is currently out with a workers compensation injury. They have a myriad of reasons that they are wanting to terminate him. Unsafe work practices, no call/no show, late for work, and several unexcused absences. He has also be very unpleasant to work with. What they are wanting to know is what they would need in place to show that this is not retaliation for the work comp claim but as a result of his performance and behavior. Also, if they are capable of terminating him, how long before they can do it. If you have any further questions, please call, Matt Murfee, 618-335-5863	
2	Can you please send me the information on severance and release agreements that we discussed? (Issue 2 of 2)	
3	Employee lost some company property. EE put in two week notice.	
3	I have an employee that will be terminated this week and is currently enrolled in our employee benefit plan. Employee contribution deductions are Bi- Weekly. Seeing as the benefits will continue through the end of the month, is it permissible to deduct both March deductions from their last check?	
0	We are hiring an employee in a KS office with an exception to our policy to provide vacation upon start. Can we stipulate that if the individual quits within the modified benefit period that we are not obligated to pay out the vacation balance as written in our company manual?	
5	An employee was scheduled to work an 8 hour day. He was terminated after he had already clocked in. Do we pay him a full day or half day.	
0	Final Wages in California: If a person's last day is March 16th. The pay period prior to that is 3/1 through 3/15 and is normally paid on 3/23, we could pay that on March 23rd and the pay for the 16th and vacation on the 16th?	
3	A client's employee who is responsible for locking and unlocking the doors to their business gave the key and pass code to her friend, a non-employee. They would like to terminate immediately for this reason. Can they do this? They handbook is very brief and does not specifcally address a process for discipline leading to termination. Do you think it would be risky to terminate?	
5	An employee had an accident at work and we sent him for a drug screen, per our normal policy and practice. The drug screen test results were positive for marijuana. This is the second injury followed by a positive drug test for marijuana that this employee has had (the other was about a year ago). Our policy states that employees cannot be under the influence at work, are subject to drug tests, and that positive drug tests will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. However, this employee also suffers from multiple sclerosis (MS); he self disclosed this to us in the interview process. He's been with us for nearly 5 years but seems to physically be getting weaker and his vision is getting worse. I'm concerned about his ability to work safely, I'm not sure whether it is related to the MS or not. I think I'd like to terminate but am not sure how to proceed.	
1	We are looking at doing a reduction in force and would like some advice on how to select employees for a RIF.	
1	We have a few employees who voluntary resigned about a year ago. The supervisor said we would keep them active in the system in case we need substitutes. They have not come back. Some we have called on occasion but they weren't available. I would like to officially separate from the system. Concerned one candidate would claim retaliation since her "mother" works for us and is on a WC leave.	
4	We have an employee who has been falsifying documents, shes been forging the parents signature on her time cards. She is currently on suspension and we will be meeting with her today to terminate her employment. Can we deduct the amount (all or part) she owes us from her final pay?	
3	Terminate employee in introductory/probationary has given verbal and written however wants to skip the suspension step and go to termination.	
4	We are in WA and recently terminated an employee. She has formally requested a letter with the reasons for her dismissal. We are wondering if you have a sample template? She was on probation and had some performance issues.	
6	If the employee terminates or resigns, can we just direct deposit the wages?	
6	Where can I locate the guidance on deducting from an employee's wages in California?	
3	What would be the appropriate procedure to recover company property (laptop) when an employee was terminated? Assuming ex employee is not willing to do the company any favors, termination was involuntary. What's the appropriate procedure/legal channel/process? Thanks, Mike	
6	Employee passed away last Friday. Final wages/Partner benefits.	
5	A former employee abandoned his job and never returned to work nor contacted us. 6 months later we got notification of a re-employment claim he filed, showing reason for leaving was voluntary/quit. A second notice arrived a few days later asking about medical conditions and all questions were health related. Isn't that protected information or can an employer provide this info to respond to a re-employment claim? It did not state that the employee was claiming a medical condition as his reason for quitting. That was found out only after we received the final determination saying benefits would be payable because he quit for Medical reasons. So my real question is can we provide medical information to a state re-employment department? If we are aware that the employee filed a claim for health reasons, then would we be able to respond since we know he initiated it?	
4	I have a question about a potential discrimination issue that I'd like to vet with an HR/legal specialist.Employee has made racial slurs,derogatory comments. We have done an investigation and have witness statements. The employee admitted to making the comments but said she didn't know what the big deal was since it was not directed at a particular person. We are moving towards termination but then she stated she felt she wasn't the right "race" to work here. She is Caucasian.	
2	Do you have a sample severance agreement for an employee over 40?	
2	I need to someone to call me. I need to go over a situation with them and need their opinion. It is regarding a possible termination.	
0	CA EE resigned and transitioned to part-time to help out.- do we need to have her rescind her resignation. Vacation pay now or later?	
5	We have a Full Time (33-35 hours per week on average) employee that has been experiencing health issues for awhile and has missed quite a bit of work. Despite this, his Dr. has always cleared him to work with no restrictions. We have not yet put his attendance issues in writing. The employee has been gone for 3 straight days this week. This morning, his Dr. faxed a release indicating that now he can only work 1/2 of the day on light duty. He does not have a visit with the Dr. for another 4 weeks. The demands of the job require the person in this position work the full-time hours necessary with no restrictions. If we were to terminate this employee because he can not meet the demands, are we leaving ourselves open to legal action since he has been placed on the modification?	
4	Regarding the same employee in question, can we have her work one week since we need to collect her client notes in order to bill, then offer to pay her the following 2 weeks until her last day but no work needs to be done. Can we do that?	
4	A group of employees are complaining about the unpredictable behavior of their supervisor, They have observed the supervisor drinking alcohol during working hours and consuming prescribed drugs. They experienced aggressive/temperamental behavior from her. We spoke with different staff members and all shared same experiences. Several confirmed the supervisor had had a glass of wine while at work. We are meeting with the supervisor tomorrow to explore this further but we are considering termination of employment due to violation of company policy-consumption of alcohol during working hours. However, she is taking Norco a pain medication and we are not sure for what or why she disclosed this to her team. there is an email where one of her staff bought and brought to work the meds. Should we include this as part of the convo with her or leave it out and only address the alcohol and performance? or are we required to have an interactive dialogue to discover any disabilities that impair her?	
5	We are the sole owners. we have an employee that has been working with us since March. In Oct he hurt his back and was out Nov and Dec and is now back. His performance is poor. Yesterday he crashed one of our largest most important machines. Today he called in sick stating that his back hurt. We have had several meetings with him and his supervisor and we moved him to a different shift. Can we terminate him?	
1	We are terminating a large portion of our employees on March 16 and a different company (who is purchasing our assets) is hiring them on March 17. I am looking for a good termination form to work from. Do you have any suggestions? We will be terming employees in the following states: California, Idaho, New Hampshire, and North Carolina.	
6	In the state of Pennsylvania if an employee is laid off when do we have to provide his final pay?	
1	Rich Schmeil We will be terminating an employee tomorrow in NJ. Just want to verify which forms are we required to give to him?	
1	Can we make a salary reduction to an exempt employee's pay related to a business downturn? We are going to be having a significant reduction in force on Friday; we only have 25 employees so I don't think we will trigger any requirements beyond what would normally be required for an individual involuntary termination. Is that correct? We are selecting the staff members who will be retained based on skill set, etc.; is there anything else I need to consider in that regard?

We are having an issue with the thee service employees Two who are ganging up on the other. We have addressed this with them as a team. Now one employee who is affected has put in her resignation. We would actually like to terminate the other employee who we feel is the problem, who is also not performing up to expectations.

This same employee has been stealing from the company by either staying on the clock when she is done for the day or coming in the mornings clocking in and using the doctor's computer for personal use before working. This is totaling 50 - 60 minutes extra of time every day over the course of several months. The doctor is wondering if he can go back and ask that she pay back what she was overpaid? The doctor is not sure about letting her go since she brings in a lot of revenue for his office. What type of steps could he take if she chooses to keep her? Also, if he decided to terminate by law what is needed since he is located in California?

We are a sign manufacturing and installation company and part of this employee's job description is to drive our company truck and climb on ladders to install signage on storefronts.

We have an employee handbook that says we can conduct random drug tests but I wanted to make sure that if I terminate, I am avoiding exposure. I know that this drug test I administered today wasn't completely random and I know that the over the counter testing supplies aren't exactly iron clad.

3	Hello, I am writing on behalf of our client W. P. Carey Inc. They will have a reduction in personnel in a few weeks and they are wondering what noticed need to be provided to the employees upon separation from an insurance standpoint. As an idea, they will provide the COBRA notices as well as the Portability Forms for the Life and Voluntary Life. Please let us know if there are any other forms that need to be provided in order for them to e compliant.

1	There are two family owned businesses (55 employees and 25 employees respectively) that are considering merging them into a single entity. Doing this would entail some layoffs in both existing businesses. What are the guidelines for retaining the top talent from both companies without exposing either to a discrimination or wrongful termination suit?	
4	(With Susan) My question is related to, we are a school we have given out all contracts for next year. We are really low but so we could not extend the contracts until more students are enrolled. How would that effect the separation agreement if it is unknown? 15-20 teachers leave at end of year. We are a private school. We do not have the enrollment to keep a teacher any longer. She carries her insurance through us and she is pregnant. Its not her fault we do not have enrollment to keep her. We were thinking to keep her on payroll so her benefits will not run out until the first of the new school year (July 31). Will keep a problem with the DOL? Her last day worked was June 2. She is paid through June 30th. We pay July 1-June 30th.	
1	Planned to terminate employee today for poor performance, but employee called in due to father's heart attack. We still need to terminate employee, but should we do it first thing upon her return. That seems insensitive. Should we wait a day or two? Please advise.	
3	I am going to terminate Steven due to poor work performance. Should I meet with him face to face or can I call him on the phone? Should I do it this afternoon when no one is really there, or should I do it Monday when Julie is there too?	
5	We have a long term employee that we want to separate from the company today due to ongoing performance issues. He makes $53,000 per year. Even though we are terminating for performance, the owners want to provide the employee with a separation payment in respect for the 20 years of service the employee has put in. We propose to pay him $2000 which is the equivalent of the bonus he would have received had he met performance goals. Would this be appropriate?	
4	We have employee who was hired on 3/8/17. She was to start her first position in a clients home on 3/9 and she called out stating that she could not coming due to her arthritis. I asked her if she required any accommodations because of her arthritis and she stated that she will not be able to perform any work when her arthritis is flaring up. This will not work because her job requires that she assist elder patients and if she seizes up she could potentially drop and kill one of them. We would like to terminate her employment.	
2	We recently eliminated a position and terminated an employee in the State of MA. We paid him a lump sum in severance after he signed a Severance Agreement. The MA Unemployment office is having me fill out a questionnaire. Since we have never terminated anyone before, is there anything I need to be aware of/careful of when I respond to the questions. How does severance impact their calculation of benefits. They have asked for a copy of the Severance Agreement. Let me know if you have any words of advice. Thanks.	
1	We are a broker in Maine. We have a situation within our organization where we are planning an upcoming separation of a commissioned benefits producer. Can you assist with helping me find some sample resources on your website in this regard?

1	We are planning to terminate an employee. The employee resides in the state of OH. Ohio is an at-will state for employment, when we talk with the employee, do we need to go into specifics or keep it vague?	
5	HR assistant, approx 3 months. Employees are a bit creeped out by this worker. He has said inappropriate comments to others and has stepped verbally over the line as an HR person multiple times.	
1	We are a staffing company. One of our contracts is ending this Sunday. We are processing final paychecks today. We understand we have to payout all accrued PTO. The employees don't want to cash out their PTO, they would rather transfer the hours to the new company. Is there a way we could legally do this?	
2	We are going to be laying off an employee next week and we would like to provide a severance. It is a male under the age of 40 are there any considerations? Do you have a sample agreements?	
5	We have an employee who has been calling off with no excuse. He has been written up, suspended, without success. He called off on Friday and again today. We are terminating him, but I must do it by mail because he is not showing up here in the office. How should we manage?	
4	We are terminating an employee today due to poor work performance. She has been with us for only 1 month. No accrued vacation. Should I notify her now or at the end of the day?	
3	I would like some further clarification around obtaining the signed authorization. You stated there is no "legal way around it" but added that we can obtain signed documentation from the employees stating that they would like their PTO rolled over. So just to confirm, is this a LEGAL way around not paying out the PTO at time of contract termination? Also, would EVERY employee have to agree to roll it over or could some choose to have it paid out and some choose to have it rolled over? Your prompt response is greatly appreciated as we must cut final checks today.	
2	I do need to attach your recommendation/advise to our finance records for paying out the PTO. Is it possible for you to send me a summary without the part about obtaining a written authorization since that is not a recommendation and may not be legal? Thank you!	
4	An employee has intermittent FMLA, paperwork of "chronic back pain. Will miss work intermittently due to flare ups of pan and for appointments. She has had two occurrences of clocking into work and not being here and has said one time due to pain and the other time stating she had forgot her medicine for her pain and had to go home to get it. She has been given written disciplinary notices for leaving her work station punched in with no notification to supervisor. The supervisor wants her terminated for this but due to FMLA we are hesitant to terminate. She has requested accommodations of a walking job which we have none as she says sitting, standing for periods of time hurts her. We offered to provide a stand/up sit down movable desk station as well as to talk brief walking breaks outside of her normal allowed breaks as long as supervisor is notified. She has asked us to hold off as she wants to meet with her Dr. If continues, can a termination occur for theft of time?

3	We have a client whose employee quit today (on pay day) after being approved for some advanced vacation pay (to help the employee out during slow season). They received an email from this employee today (after the pay hit his account) stating that he quits. He also let them know that he left the company truck near the Wisconsin border (we are located in Illinois) and where they can find the keys. Is there anything the employer can do from a legal standpoint? Can they stop payment on the check that hit his account? Or do anything to get back that extra money they paid him?	
5	We have an employee who is a performer and he gave notice of resignation with his last day being March 24. He verbally resigned and also told his manager that he wants to take vacation through 3/16. We would like to make his last day 3/17. Can we do that without it affecting his voluntary resignation?	
5	An employee was went late for FMLA and sent a resignation letter why he was out. We found out we overpaid him while on leave and he did not contribute for benefits. We talked to him when he resigned. He is in Northern California and a manger contacted him to meet with him and return company laptop. He did not show up and he is no longer answer calls. We want to write a letter to him, we are going to certify it and ail it to his home address. Do you have a sample letter?	
1	An employee was placed on a layoff status 2 years ago and they keep in contact with us. We were going to bring them back last month. However, due to budgetary reasons we continued their layoff. I was just notified that the position was completely eliminated - we promised we would bring this person back. Do you have any samples?	
5	Hello, We have a situation that needs experienced input: Danny (manager) was brought to this company five years ago. He offered us a specialized work division that blended with our Wireless Cell site work with current customer: Verizon. He brought with him a crew of 4-5 employees that worked with him in the past. Since he started with us, he's worked out of his home and managed the scheduling, bidding, and connections with our customer Verizon (specifically) from that location. We provided a storage warehouse for his equipment, and our office supported him by managing the Verizon purchase orders and doing the billing. Within the past year or two, changes were made at Verizon that brought in new Project Managers along with new procedures. No longer were they handing out work to Danny, but were requiring a more competitive process of bidding against some new competition in the area. He has continued to be profitable for the company and expanded his crew to nine. A week ago, one of his most experienced and long term crew members (John) called the President (Rick) with some concerns regarding Danny. A Verizon manager called John, to relay what occurred at a meeting with Danny. The Verizon manager was talking to Danny about a current project. Danny announced 'that's not the way we do things'. The manager then told Danny that if he makes that comment one more time, he won't be working for Verizon any longer. Rick called to speak to the Verizon manager and a meeting was set for today. At the meeting, it was revealed that Danny has been presenting himself as the head of LD Strobel. He made comments regarding: "it starts with me, and ends with me" He was labeled as being narcissistic, overbearing, abrasive, and condescending (to name a few). It was only recently that this division of Verizon realized Danny has a boss that would hold him accountable had they known. At this moment, no further work will be given to Danny's department per Verizon's directive. Rick will be firing Danny. His volatile and aggressive attitude is quite concerning. Our plan is to assign another manager to take over Danny's department. We value his crew and their continued employment is important to us. Questions for you: What is the best way to present to Danny? We are concerned about his post firing actions. Is there something we should do to prevent him from actions against us or our customer? A restraining order was brought up. I heard of one option of trading a severance package for an agreement to have no future contact with our customer, and no presence on any customer property. Is this something to consider? Your help in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.	
1	Terminating an employee and offering severance. If we pay the employee severance; 1) can we pay out as lump sum outside of payroll. If so, would we need to document this on payroll or send them a 1099 at the end of the year? 2) What are the considerations if we paid their COBRA payments for 6 months? Does this force the employee into not having benefit options later?	
1	We have a senior member of our management team that has offered resignation. We have opted to part ways today on account of an observed pattern of behavior and recent report of inappropriate behavior/sharing confidential information with team members. If we do this today is there anything specific we need to consider? The employee also holds access/passwords to many of our compliance filings and log-ins. If we are unable to receive the passwords, what is our recourse? Can we take action if the former employee makes commentary on social media (e.g. yelp)?	
1	We are a subcontractor. Our contractor wants us to reduce the workforce by one and they will hire the person who is laid off. The person that was last hired is a black female. However, we have chosen this position because of the seniority and financial burden. Is there any risk?

2	Do you have a sample severance agreement?	
3	We recently had a termination and the employee has filed for unemployment. They had to sign a release of claims to get their severance. They did sign this. In the letter from unemployment they are asking whether there was a severance or release of claims. If we answer yes, will this impact the employee's ability to get unemployment? They are in Massachusetts. We also received a "lack of work" notification - the employee indicated the reason for separation was lack of work. This was not the case. Do we HAVE to respond to this inquiry?	
1	difference between elimination of a position and layoff Hello, We have eliminated a position, is there a difference in eliminating a position and laying a person off? if they are one in the same and we have given severance for a layoff, would we give severance for eliminating a position?

1	Our company is possibly looking at having to layoff several hourly manufacturing employees in the future.

4	We have a long time employee (9 years) who has had three different roles. She is currently in partnership (membership sales). She is a wonderful person and is loved by all but it is turning out she is not right for her current role. I was invited to lunch last week by a young man who could be a perfect fit for that role. We are considering three options: I offer it to him and let the current employee go I bring him on in her role (which we have open) and offer her the part time role Do nothing She is aware that she is not performing and is concerned that she is being laid off. She is not hitting the numbers set as a goal but there are some extenuating circumstances; we had another person leave and she filled her role (b/c it was a previous role) in a dual capacity for several months. That may have impacted her ability to meet goals. She has been fully in the new sales role for about 2.5 months. The current employee is in her 50s while the individual we are considering is probably in his late 30s.	
4	Situation. Assistant GM she advised us she would be taking two weeks off to visit her mother. We found out that instead she was incarcerated. We found out by a tenant. The tenant disclosed how he found the information by using the OCC Sheriff website. What do we do about her return? We expect her to return tomorrow. Can we ask her about her time off and whether she was incarcerated? Her job duties entail cash handling, deposits, bank, key card, access to any guest room. We have to be able to trust our GMs. We dont know why she was incarcerated but we know she got a DUI recently.	
4	We have a Customer Service Rep that has complained to her co-workers that her wrist & arms hurt.

This ee has been a hair dresser from over 30 years, had couple tunnel surgery on both arms approximately 30 years ago, has been awarded a couple of auto accident claims, gone bankrupt and is friends with a terminated employee that just settled a workers comp claim with our company. We currently have discussed laying off a CSR because business has slowed and we would like to get rid of this employee. Our concern is with her history she will turn this into a work comp claim. She has not come to me reporting a work injury. Please advise. Thank you!	
2	I am preparing a severance agreement for an employee over the age of 40 years. What is the timeline I must allow for him to consider it? Do you have a sample agreement? Does the payment need to be in a lump sum?

1	We have an employee in Denver, CO and gave one month notice of resignation. The manager is saying they do not have any work for him and would rather let him go.	
3	Good morning, I have a question regarding laying off a new hire (less than 30 days) vs. termination. Understand if a person is laid off, they qualify for unemployment benefits. If they are terminated, the employer can contest this request and may win or lose. Terminations are often contested by the terminated employee so we have learned to document our verbal and written warnings. Is this also true when there is a lay off? Is there a general standard as to the length of time an employer should wait after a lay off before they can hire for the same position? Is there any additional guidance or information you think I should have before making our decision to terminate or lay off our new hire? Obviously we believe she may not go away gently... Thank you for your assistance. Warm regards, Pearl

3	Pay Question I am hoping that someone can assist with answering a question for me. Here are the details; We are, unfortunately, going to be laying a handful of staff off this year. The majority of the staff being laid off (we are a school) are teacher's. All of our staff, teacher or not, are paid on a 12 month basis. The final day of the school this year is June 22nd, 2017 and the last pay day of the year is August 25th, 2017. We have been under the impression that since the teacher's are paid on a 12 month basis that their pay would continue until the last pay cycle of the 12 month period (August 25th, 2017). Although this is not the reason for paying staff on a 12 month basis, but having everyone paid on a 12 month basis means that their elected benefits (health and/or dental) can remain in tact through the summer. Is there a reason that we should not or can not (law or some other reason) continue with their pay through the summer? Thank you for your help, Andrea Stern Andrea G.

We have a client who has an employee go on maternity leave. Her last day of work was 4/27. She took her PTO time from that date forward and wanted to stay on the health insurance, so the employer kept her on the medical plan and paid for her major medical from PTO pay. She was due back to work last week and never showed up. It was after at least 6 weeks and they expected her to return as of a specific date. They called her on 6/5, the day after they expected, and they said you were supposed to come back to work yesterday. She said that she isnt going to come back to work. They have over 20 employees. How would this termination be handled?

6	In the state of Michigan, is it legal to withhold an employee's final paycheck, if you believe that they owe their employer damages due to misconduct.

A question was raised as to whether they can simply be paid as part of the normal pay cycle or if they must be paid on the last day of school? Our fiscal year ends July 31st, 2017. This also raises a question as to benefit eligibility. If they are eligible for benefits would their benefits terminate on the last day of school or at the end of the current fiscal year?

He has asked us to change the separation to a resignation instead of a termination.	
4	Nicole called in with Chris from Just Works on the phone as well. We have an employee who will be terminated at 3:30pm today and Just Works has already processed her check through direct deposit to be paid on the 15th. There is no way to issue her a physical check today minus the two PTO. We would have to wait until she receives the paycheck on the 15th and then reverse it and provide a physical check. How can we terminate the employee today, and ensure she is paid out correctly?

1	We have a small shift in our business environment and we are going to have to terminate some employees - low end performers - both full-time and part-time. They're all over 40. If we are consistent if saying under performance, does that really matter? We're putting out a memo that we're looking to downsize, but that it is not a layoff scenario. We are terminating at-will employment and removing personal belongings. These are repeatedly low performers on staff for the last 5 years.	
4	At will employment: Can at will exist employment and disciplinary action co-exist? I want to try and real somebody in; but, I do not want to send a message that we won't terminate unless we have cause. The cause is to bland, it is nonsensical.

The position is that they are not speaking to me and this has to stop and I want to terminate them.

5	We have a consultant working at a client site and we have attempted to talk to him to tell him his project will be ending. We have attempted to reach out via phone and email. He has not contacted the client as well.	
1	If an employee gives notice saying their last day is Friday, and we choose to let them go earlier, are we required to pay them through Friday?	
5	We have an employee who was on an extended FMLA, he returned 3/13. He was on a leave for mental health issues and his behavior when he returned was very erratic. He was cursing and waving around a screw driver. His wife called last night to let us know he was admitted to the hospital last night. While he curses and get mad easily, he's never directly threatened anyone. There is only a single documentation of his outbursts. Can we terminate him now that his FMLA has exhausted?	
4	I have an employee who resigned. She has a badge and another company-issued item. Can I hold the check until that is returned? She said she'd have a family member return it but she's already out of the country. We're not sure we'll receive it. Also, she resigned after 1/3 of the month. How should we process her bonus?	
2	Do you know of any type of template for Thinking of putting together a generic letter for exiting employees that outlines when benefits end, COBRA information(when they can expect to receive packet) and length of COBRA, how to rollover 401k funds and contact information for each benefit provider. Basically a document that will answer the most basic questions employees have when they leave. Thought that would be a useful letter to hand out. I worry we are missing something to tell exiting employees. What do you think? Do you currently have anything like that?	
1	We currently have three offices and are going to condense down to two offices within a number of months. It will involve the elimination of two positions because of duplication of roles. We want to discuss the reasons of why those two positions would be chosen, the timing of when to let the team and those affected know, and best practice in executing the reduction in force. In this case both of the positions are the newest employees to the company. (Issue 1 of 2)	
2	Can you please send sample severance and release agreements and information surrounding severance? (Issue 2 of 2)	
2	Typically we issues a separation release for employees that are being released along with any type of severance that is being issued. Can we still provide release to employee that resigned voluntarily even if there is no severance being issued?	
5	Follow up on an issue we had before where an employee is claiming that he was not paid his proper tips or breaks. We is saying that he is going to submit a wage claim with the state of Colorado. We have looked into the matter and his claims are unsubstantiated as we cannot determine if the tips were paid as tips are the property of the employees. Furthermore, I have interviewed managers that say that he was given proper breaks. Is there anything else we should do to prepare?	
6	On a final paycheck in California, I want to know if I choose to terminate today but pay through tomorrow to comply with the final pay requirement, can I mail the check out to the employee? It will take longer for them to receive it.	
6	Final check rule for employee FL	
4	Question about termination of an employee who returned from a leave of absence. I have an idea of what I want to do and I want to talk to somebody about it. I've called on this person before - Manager at one of our restaurants, not a strong performer, had discussions about letting her go, but before we addressed any performance issue with her, she went on a 7 week disability that went on for 7 months. We figured out a way to hold the job open for her. She's been back a month and still is not performing and employees are complaining. I would like to know the best way to approach the termination. I think because she isn't performing, we give her a warning and a chance to improve, then if she doesnt improve process the termination. Or should we layoff. We were able to do just fine without her. Job shifted while she was out for all managers.	
4	My employee gave two weeks notice that she is quitting, but I want to end her employment today. Will that turn her quit into a termination? And if so, will it mean she can collect unemployment insurance even though she quit? And do I have to pay her out for the two weeks?	
6	Final check rule for IL Employee	
5	We terminated someone a week ago. He filed for UI even though he was terminated for cause. How does it affect our SUTA, FUTA?	
4	We gave a manager a final written warning for performance in Nov/December. Her performance has improved however is not at the level a manager should perform and needs her manager to guide every action.. She was supposed to do staff training tomorrow for her specific position to the staff and reported today her child is sick and she will not be here. Do we have grounds to tell her she is expected to report to work? We would like to terminate her, but are unsure if we have sufficient grounds for termination.	
6	Can you provide me with a list of the states that allow an employer to issue final wages as Direct Deposit? I would like to know for all 50 states, but in the meantime, can we focus on 16 states? TX, NC, MS, CO, AL, OK, MO, NE, NY, OH, CA, SC, VA, GA, TN, IA.	
2	I have a client who needs to write up a non-renewal of an MDs employment agreement, I was wondering you had any samples/examples that you could send me? I want to be sure I word the letter correctly.	
3	Is it permissible/legal to layoff/terminate an employee who is on maternity leave? This is a small group (under 15 employees) and not subject to FMLA. The employee in question went on leave as of 5:00pm on 01/13/2017 and her child was born on 02/02/2017. What are the ramifications/consequences?	
1	We require 60 day's notice. If an employee is able to leave sooner because we find someone to fill the position should we have the employee update their resignation letter.	
5	An employee has given us a 2 month resignation notice, but he's not doing anything anymore. Can we terminate him before then?	
1	Yvonne McMurray called in to seek advice, she works for Mark: We are a support living service agency - 20 staff members who service development disabled clients. One staff member has had a lot of call outs. However, we were short staffed so we didn't mention it to him. We found out that he drank alcohol with a client. The client came forward to make statement. We are trying to figure out if we should terminate At-Will or for Cause.	
1	If an employee give a 2 week notice and we accept the resignation effective immediately, do we still have 24 hours to get them a check or will it be like normal payroll.	
2	I have an employee who works in the New York Office that we are planing to terminate. What information do I need to provide this employee upon termination?	
6	We let a temporary employee go on Saturday and he's threatening to file a wage claim because his final check was not issued immediately. Is there a different requirement for staffing agencies?	
6	We have a terminated employee whose final paycheck we sent via certified mail. The mail was returned back to us because there was nobody to receive it nor was it picked up. I have also tried to leave email and voicemail messages, but no response. What should our next step be? You can email your response to joyb@achome.org. Thanks.	
1	I am terminating someone tomorrow and I want to make sure that my process is correct. It could be contentious. Final pay will be available and we will be giving two week's severance. I also have the notice to employee. Is there anything else I need to be providing to them?	
1	We hired two individuals to run the office but is not meeting our needs. We missed a payroll and our broker has commented they have had issues working with these individuals as well. We are going to meet with the employees today, but have made the decision that we will need to make some changes. Is there anything we should keep in mind?	
2	Is severance pay required in Texas?	
3	A trucking company provides new hires with 5 company logo shirts at no cost to the employee. Their policy states that any employee who voluntarily terminates employment within the 90-day introductory period will be charged $20/shirt upon termination. Is this lawful?

4	We recently let go of an employee. We just received unemployment paperwork. The morning we let her go she asked if there was anything she could do to keep her job. She asked if we could give her another week to learn the system. We agreed to allow her another week to train, however, when she was told this training needed to be in the office, she decided to leave. They are asking whether she was terminated or resigned.	
1	We have an employee that we are going to terminate today. The executives have asked if we can pay the employees COBRA expense for a set time after the employee is terminated. Is this allowable/common We haven't experienced this before and would like to talk about the practice.	
2	We are terminating an employee tomorrow but would like to offer severance in exchange for cooperation for customer and vendor information as needed after termination. Should I keep on payroll or 1099 for severance offer in exchange for further assistance as needed in the month following separation from service?	
4	We have an employee who has excessive absences. She was placed on a final and her attendance did not improve. Today she called in sick again, but she has informed her supervisor that she is pregnant. We should have terminated her before. Can we terminate now?	
1	Do we have anything that address different unemployment laws in each State: TX, NY, IL, IN, MA, DC.	
4	HR issue after reviewing 90 day performance there were several points that needed corrections. Next day she wants to quit turns in 2 week. She has access to very sensitive information and we would rather let her go as of the date of her notice.	
4	Unregistered User: Company name: Jane Smith Agency / Caller: Holly Moss / Phone: 253-269-2070 / Email: holly@janesmithagency.com We have a senior level employee in New York who we need to reclassify as a consultant. We would like to keep her on as an independent contractor (under 1099), however, if she does not agree to this, what information will we need to provide her if she chooses to separate? When is final pay due in New York?	
1	Hello again, Thank you very much for all of the information that you have provided. In reading over your response; no longer in regards to this specific employee, we have a general question on the topic. In a case where we have an employee provide an extended notice of resignation (say a month or possibly even more), and they inform us that they are going to one of our competitors; given the nature of our business and the need for confidentiality, are we then required to pay this employee for the full extended notices time frame even if we need to sever the employment at the time of notice (again due to confidentiality with them signing on with a competitor)? Thank you! Megan	
4	We have an employee who went out on medical leave over a month ago and she keeps giving us doctor's notes to extend it. She is supposed to be back on the 14th. We have not heard from her about returning. We are hearing through the grapevine she is trying to get fired so she can collect workers' comp. Is there a way that we can terminate her without firing her? Can we call it job abandonment?	
1	If we are potentially laying off 5 employees on the same day, are there any laws/regulations against each employee having a different severance package? For example, if we were to offer COBRA premium payments for one employee, are we expected to do the same for all other affected employees?	
0	Do you have to pay an employee PTO/sick/vacation when you terminate them?	
3	Can an employee ask for a voluntary lay-off and are they able to collect unemployment benefits? Does there position get held for them or is it up to the company if they want to bring them back? Also, is the employee eligible for COBRA if the carry company insurance? Thank you. Laura Cirignano	
4	One of our new hires just informed us that she is pregnant. In addition, we have overhired and need to let one person go. She was the last one hired. How should we manage this? We also have a policy of no tardies, absences or leaving early during the first 90 days of hire. She has been tardy and has left early due to her pregnancy. How should we manage?	
1	We have an employee, our Staff Accountant, in our finance department of two people (the other individual is our Controller). As the department grows, we feel that we need a more senior skillset so there isn't as steep of a drop off in capabilities between the Controller and the Staff Accountant. The problem is: we may backfill him with an individual (already identified former contractor) who initially will be at the same level, but eventually has more potential to meet our needs after some training. We don't feel he has the same potential. The person we'd hire would be an Accounting Specialist at first, with plans to promote to Accounting Manager within a year. But, as I mentioned, their job duties would be identical at first. Would we still be able to consider this a lay off (because the needs for capabilities have evolved and the incumbent doesn't possess the potential to develop those capabilities) or would it be more advisable to term it a termination?	
5	I'm the new HR director. One manager was inquiring about the legality about terminating an employee for a variety of reasons. Attendance and performance issues. Some time he missed does have a doctor's note. Would that have a impact on the termination? Verbal discussion regarding performance and attendance (not including doctor's notes).	
6	We have another employee whose last day of no call/no show was Monday. What the rule on final pay under these circumstance?	
3	What is the best practice when asking employee to leave before end of resignation period? What possible liability is there to the employer.	
0	Our company does not have anything in writing pertaining to paying out PTO when an employee resigns. Are we required to pay them?	
3	If I have an employee that voluntarily leaves our company (this is usually without notice), can I hold off closing out their benefit account until I get a voluntary term for signed by them? This benefit account is for the hourly fringe dollars paid into a 3rd pty account weekly for their withdrawal. 1% is held by the administrator until the end of the trust year unless they terminate. It can be emptied at that time.	
4	We have an employee who texted her resignation to her manager, saying she will not becoming in the next day or any other day. Should this employee still get a letter stating we accepted her resignation as of the date she sent the text?	
5	Situation #1 We have an employee who has an open workers compensation claim. He was offered a modified duty position, part time 20 hours a week. He has been doing this for three weeks. He is not completing his full 20 hours and is on average missing one day per week. Or when he is here, he can't complete the four hours because he has an appointment or doesn't feel well. We've asked him to try to make appointments in the afternoon. His schedule is 8 to 10, then he is supposed to take an hour break and then work again from 11-1 (his doctor requested the break). He will go to take the break and will come back before the end and says he is fine and then finish the two hours. Yesterday he did not take a break at all and he worked through it. Today he didn't come in because he was in pain. Situation #2 One of our employees expressed interest in purchasing a company vehicle and we agreed. We agreed two months ago to the purchase but it was all verbal and we left it to one of our managers, John, to arrange the details. We recently received a smog notice and our maintenance supervisor went to John and alerted him to say that it didnt look like the employee had transferred the paperwork for ownership. The manager responded and said that the person actually hadnt even paid for the vehicle yet and none of the paperwork had been done. It was also still on the company insurance policy. We were obviously surprised by this and in the course of investigating further found that the reason the employee had not paid is because he had sold his vehicle to John and was waiting for that money to pay for the truck. This instance is one in a long line of many performance issues and scenarios where John has not put his personal interests before his company duty. We are planning to terminate him but the owner doesnt wants to say that he wasnt a cultural fit, versus saying he was terminated for performance. The owner is concerned the individual wont get unemployment insurance if he is terminated for performance.	
3	I have a client who has terminated an associate effective 06/01 but the last official day worked was 05/31. The benefits run until the end of the month the associate is terminated. However, my client wants to know why the associate is still being covered until 06/30 if they did not work or was paid for their time on 06/01. According to HR, the termination was a "sticky" situation. Would the benefits still run until the end of June or would they need to switch the term date to 05/31 since the associate was not paid for and did not work 06/01? Corporate office is in Columbus Ohio but the associate worked in the Texas office.	
3	question We had 2 employees that were caught sleeping on the job, in the state of Arizona. Our customer wants to withhold pay. I wanted to see if this is legal? They will be terminated for this conduct but I needed to see if we are required to pay them for their time sleeping?

1	If we offer a employee a severance package can we have them sign release of unemployment rights?	
5	We have an employee who was insubordinate and we sent him home. I've tried reaching him today to terminate him but he is not answering his phone. I was thinking of leaving a note on his timecard that he is terminated if he comes in to work tonight. Can I do this?	
1	We will be laying off one employee over the age of 40 in St. Paul. Two other employees will be paid off at a different location. We will be offering severance. Do I need to offer the individual over 40 with the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act notice?	
4	We have an employee who was promised a title change and pay increase by her former manager. The current manager confirmed for her that an increase is simply not in the budget. Additionally, the title change will not be made either. This employee is upset and has expressed to 2-3 managers that she will be resigning. She has also stated that she will also be joining a group EEO claim currently against the company which we find threatening. My plan is to meet with her later this week and discuss the situation with the title change and increase which will not happy unfortunately. I also want to give her an opportunity to clarify her comments about the EEO claim. I will accept her resignation but tell her she's no longer required to work and we'll pay her through her notice period. What are your thoughts?	
5	Hi ThinkHR! I have an employee who is thinking of giving notice, but is trying to figure out exactly when, knowing that his benefits only go through the end of the month, in the month that he is termed. He knows about COBRA, but that would be expensive. His employer is tight on money and he is worried, that if he gives his two weeks notice toward the end of June, could his employer say, 'sorry, we're not paying you for the next two weeks and today is going to be your last day.'? Is this a legal possibility? Are their any rules around this? He wants his term date to be in the beginning of July, but he is worried that his employer will let him go as soon as he gives his two weeks notice. Therefore his last day will be in June and his benefits will only go through the end of June.	
4	I have an exempt employee who has turned in her notice with her last day to be Monday 6/26/17 which is the first working day of the pay period. She is scheduled to be on vacation that day. For organizational reasons we would like to pay her out and have her leave immediately. I'm trying to compute her final paycheck but I am not sure how to handle the final week where she will be on vacation for her last day. She will not actually perform any work that week. Do I pay her for the entire week? Do I even have to give her a final paycheck on the day we dismiss her since she has turned in a resignation, i.e. we didn't terminate her but we are ending her resignation early. I know in Colorado you have to issue a final paycheck immediately to a terminated employee, but she initiated the termination.	
4	We have an employee who we have written up for tardiness on multiple occasions and now she's been falling asleep on the job. She has a verbal warning for falling asleep at work and she has fallen asleep again. We have witnesses to this and a photograph of her asleep at work. if we terminate her for this would she be able to receive unemployment?	
4	We just hired someone and we need to let them go. Came to work one day and it is just not working out. She is not grasping anything. She was hired for a very technical job - her references were glowing and she has 3 certificates. She came in yesterday and our folks had to hand hold her on everything. We don't have the capacity to teach her. We are thinking of calling her today and telling her the skill set is different than what we need and that we don't have time to train her. She didn't know how to do cut and paste. She did not know how to even maneuver around the software. What documentation do we provide?	
3	Fraudulent Claim Activity We have a self-funded client that has recently been notified by the administrator of their plan that a current employee has submitted multiple fraudulent claims between 2012-2014 totaling $1,632.00. The services were scheduled but the appointments were cancelled, the member submitted paper claims and received reimbursement directly from the plan. In one instance the reimbursement was sent to the provider, who notified the administrator of the possible fraudulent activity. The member has entered into a payment plan with the administrator to re-pay the plan in the amount of $1,632.00. The group wants to know if they can terminate this employee due to the fraudulent claim filing. It is essentially stealing from the employer since this is a self-funded plan.	
3	We have an employee that was hired in our Maintenance dept back in November 2016. This employee is not a fit for the position due to his skills, unable to do handyman tasks.. This employee only has a verbal on file for taking a long lunch and the owner wants to terminate his employment and hire someone with the skills that will match a handyman job description. Can you please advise us on how we can stay within the labor laws if they choose to terminate employment? Thank you,	
5	I called about a month ago regarding this same issue - its ongoing. An employee had not been showing up for work. Finally, he emailed because he was in a recovery center (which is why he couldn't call). I responded to his email and asked for a certification. He's only been with us 2-3 months. He emailed a couple days later and stated he would call his doctor and would get back to me on Monday (May 3rd). Another week passed and I called and emailed. It has been a month. We have called and emailed several times. Should I send him a job abandonment letter?	
5	We have an employee who claimed a work-related injury. He was seen at the clinic by a doctor and placed on modified duty. We accommodated the modified work but we've seen a decrease in his attendance and has begun to be absent without calling in. Today was the 3rd day in a row that he no-called/no-showed and we have a 3-day policy on this. I've been calling and leaving messages but he's not responding. How should I handle this?	
1	We would like to institute a mandatory retirement age. Can we do that ?	
4	We are a managed service provider. An employee is on a client site 40 hours per week. The client is unhappy with her performance and wants her removed. We do not have any other spots available to move her to so we need to terminate her. What do I state as the reason for termination?	
1	We are trying to institute a formal severance policy, and determine if we want it to be ERISA or non-ERISA (ad-hoc). We'd prefer not to add the extra administration of an ERISA plan, but may want the flexibility it provides. Can you help with a comparison we can provide to Execs to make the decision?	
1	We will be terminating two remote sales employees due to performance issues. We have followed our disciplinary practice and have offering guidance and counseling. We do not anticipate improvement. Are their any forms we need to provide at termination? One works in Connecticut, the other in Pennsylvania.	
5	California employee: Last week, a warehouse employee was gone, the manager did not know where the employee was, and asked if he was on break (he was). The employee was angry that the manager "checked up on him." The employee refused to talk to him and told the manager to f-off. He started screaming and yelling, was insubordinate and we ended up terminating him. I had to start screaming to stop - I was afraid fighting was going to start. He brought up issues because his manager doesn't listen to them, he's never there, gone all the time - we talked to other employees, the manager is gone more than half the time. As far as the manager not being there, it has happened for a while. His manager was supposed to give him a warning and didn't. At this point I am advising it is a performance issue and management wants to term him. They are looking at this as theft. We have someone going out to talk to him (the manager). He leaves for family "stuff."	
6	The employee is being terminated and his check is not enough to cover the full cost of benefits. Is it okay to issue a net zero check for an exempt employee in the state of TX?	
3	It's regarding an employee resigning vs abandoning their job.	
6	We have Iowa location recruitment effort. We have a policy to pay for relocation, with an agreement that the employee pay this back to the employer if they do not stay for a minimum of one year. We hired and relocated an employee who stayed only two weeks. He left without paying his rent, and without picking up his last paycheck. His check is for approx. $300. Would we be able to withhold this final paycheck as repayment for the relocation?	
5	The employee we terminated after 4 days back in April sent us another email on June 11. He said he has a machine, Mitchel Lie and Lock, and wanted to know if we wanted to buy it. He went on to bring up that it bothered him that he was never able to speak to anyone regarding his termination and why he was let go after such a short amount of time. He said he moved here to take the job and went out of his way to learn the position. He doesn't understand why he can't talk with the board regarding the defamation of character and that if he doesn't get to speak with someone he will have no choice but to have his attorney address this with the company. None of these statements are true. He moved here to follow his girlfriend and we hired him for an hourly position. The GM should not have mentioned the complaint from the club member, but that was not why he was terminated.	
6	When is final pay due in Colorado?	
1	We have a question about commission payments for a terminating employee in CA? In terms of the description of how we would pay, it should state how the commission is calculated and when it would be payable.	
0	In the great state of Utah, am I legally required to pay out positive balance vacation time off for separating employees in their final pay	
3	How many weeks is someone eligible for for unemployment? I have a few employees that have mentioned that their unemployment is or has run out already and they've been out since mid January. Is there a way for them to extend coverage? If we have no return to work date are they required to look for a job? If we have employees out on lack of work and then bring them back, does unemployment start over if we have them on lack of work again? Especially if their unemployment has run out. We had an employee leave our employment last month and took a new job and only lasted there about 4 days. I just have an unemployment hearing this morning. Do you know if that person's unemployment will fall on us because they didn't work enough time at the new job? Please call me at 434-329-3601 if I've asked too many questions to email.	
6	Received from client: What paperwork do we need to complete when an employee is removed from a contract by the government/when an employee loses his or her clearance/when we need to remove due to disciplinary reasons?	
1	We need to fire an employee for theft. We have the employee on surveillance stealing from the company. What are we required to so in this instance?	
4	We do not have a cyber-bulling policy in place. There were no direct threats but indirectly through another staff on face book a staff gave a warning to a different staff "Hopefully work RESPECT will pop into her head next time. NO other chick should be wearing his SHIT except me! his WOMEN. She better keep her distance from me at work and there won't be a problem." This was all over face book. The chick she referring to works with her boyfriend. There is no issue. Diane the one making threats works in another program. The "chick" feels threatened. I would like to terminate. There have been no other like offenses. Do you think this would be a good decision to terminate? The three staff work for us, one is a couple. Another staff member pointed it out to me. I asked the "chick" if anything had occurred at work and she said nothing has happened. Diane is someone who stirs up little issues with others, but has never fully crossed the line.	
5	The employee is currently on a 90-day probationary period. He claims he was hurt while working so a workers' comp claim was submitted. The doctor released him to modified duty. At the same time, the employee failed to show up for 2 weeks after I communicated we had work for him to do. Specifically, we wanted him to right with a new hire to show him the routes. We have also found out that when he tested positive to in his post-accident drug test. Do you see risk with terminating.

4	We have an employee that was hired as a executive assistant and an office manager. She has been employed since December. We have documented her poor performance and she also received a poor performance review. The company has given her two weeks notice to help us transition. She is 52 years old. Is this something we should worry about?	
1	We have an employee who has been placed in jail. We suspect he will be there for a long time. We have terminated him, but his tools are still here. What can we do to deliver them? We do not trust to release the property to his emergency contact. What are our options?	
4	An employee's last day is today. She will not sign a letter saying she is terminating employment - she says her last day is today but she is remaining on call. She has decided to remain on call and won't sign the letter. She resigned, and we told her she could be opn call as a courtesy, but we will never call her. Can she file for UI?	
6	In the State of GA, what is the policy regarding final pay when an employee is terminated?	
1	We have an employee who is suspected of drug use. He has recently stated to another employee that he has used drugs while at work and we have recently found drug paraphernalia on premise. We do not drug test. We have previously connected the employee in question with supportive services for addiction. We would like to provide disciplinary action up to termination for this issue. Are we able to provide a warning to the employee based on the facts available? Can we terminate the employee?	
5	If I have an employee on restricted work for workers compensation and we are able to offer him work within the restrictions and we send him a return to work letter VIA certified letter and advise him of such and inform him to return on Monday, March 13 at 0630 and to date he has not called or reported, can we consider this employee as a no call and no show for 4 consecutive days and terminate him for cause. We are not terminating him for his work comp injury, but for the no calls and no shows. We know he got our letter to return to work.	
5	We recently terminated an employee in OR who brought some type of firearm to work. We have a zero tolerance for weapons at the workplace. A police report was filed. He says it was a pellet gun.

1	Employee violated company policy by pulling up another employee's pay information on that EEs computer. We are terminating him. How should I state reason for termination. Other than this episode, he is a good employee, 3 years of service. We will not dispute his UI.	
5	We have an employee who has been on an off WC since September. He has exhausted his FMLA. We had not heard from him since early March when he told the HR Coordinator that he was quitting. We had also asked our WC insurance for an updates and they didn't have any. Therefore, we terminated his employment based on job abandonment. We sent the letter and this morning we received an updated doctor's note that states that the employee will be out until April 1st. Is it prohibited to terminate someone on WC?	
0	We have an employee whose last day at the office was February 24, 2017. Prior to the last day, the employee was approved for vacation (unpaid) but did not come back to work at any point after vacation. Our thought is that the employee would be terminated from coverage effective 2/28/2016 as the last day worked was 2/24/2016. Can you tell us if there is any law that would otherwise permit the employee's coverage to be terminated the following month as the employee returned from vacation on 3/10/2017? Returned but not to work....

2	Looking for a teacher, found one, looked good on paper. Yesterday was first day. She was late coming back from lunch. Taking husband to hospital temperature, possible surgery, wont be in for the next three days. Can't tell you to terminate. Termination has risk. Employment At Will - just cause. Business decision. Small business with families counting on you. Poor judgement to start work when husband was so ill.

4	We just let an employee go. We feel we have support that she was giving away things in order to make sales. She is requesting a copy of our handbook. In looking at her personnel file it looks as if she may never have received one. What should I do?	
4	I have a scenario where an employee has not been performing up to par. She has been with us for at least 4-5 years. She hasn't had the right leadership or mentorship in her department because of turnover. But there really is not initiative in her role. She has one employee under her. She does not take initiative to find more ways for funding, etc. She just puts out fires and handles the day to day. We don't see her demonstrating the leadership qualities needed to run the department. She's good at saying yes to things, but there is a delay and there is not an initiative to make things better.

4	We have an employee that started with us last September. As of the start of this year she has taken 15 days off due to illness/personal reasons. This has become a burden to us, as work is not being completed, and her absences cause delay in finalizing work. May we terminate? The straw that broke the camels back stems from last week she was out on Monday, came in on Tuesday left early on Wednesday and was out on Thursday and Friday. This is not an ADA issue, as there are varied excuses.

1	A staff member is out on workers' comp and we are doing our budget for next year and we want to eliminate her position for budget reasons. Can we do this? She our outreach coordinator. We want to have another staff member do it when we have an outreach event. Since she's been out, we've had to have other people do the work - it wasn't worth it to hire someone temporarily. Now we understand we can do the work without an outreach coordinator and we are in a budget crunch. What about reducing the hours? Its half-time, maybe going down to quarter time.	
4	It's regarding involuntary termination or separation. Our receptionist is not working out. She's slow to complete tasks and she's just not the face we want for our organization. What reason should we put on the separation notice.

She was hired in early May and was a no call/no show on first shift but brought in a doctor's note saying she was in the hospital. Same happened May 26th. On May 30th she called out and then her supervisor asked to meet with her on May 31st to discuss attendance and find out what was going on. She was a no-call/no-show on May 31st. We discussed considering it job abandonment. However, she called back June 1st later in the day and said she wanted to come to work but we informed her that she was considered to have abandoned her job. She called me (HR) and explained that she had concerns with a coworker and had medical issues impacting her ability to work. She didn't want to talk over phone so I set up a time to meet on June 5th. She didn't show up to our meeting or call. I called back and asked her to follow up. She left a message saying there are medical reasons. We scheduled a new meeting and she no-call/no-showed again. About an hour ago she left a message but it has been three days since we were supposed to meet. I can't even hold the interactive process because she no call/no shows. Can we proceed with termination/job abandonment at this point?

One the person who was brought back was brought back in a different job than he was doing before and we are spending a lot of money to train him. He is also working part time in the hotel industry and has stated that as soon as he is offered a full time job he will give his notice. Can we terminate him because we know he's going to leave as soon as he gets a full time job and hire back someone else who we know can do the job we are training him for?

3	Baby Doctor, Unregistered User: Shachar Golan, 2124707519 shachar@babydoctor.com I have an employee in New York and an employee in Pennsylvania. Would a resignation allow them to receive benefits?	
4	It is regarding FMLA in CA. I have 2 different ones. We are doing a RIF. One person who just got off of disability but not under FMLA. (CA). The California employee's SDI ended on 6/6/17 and she will start her PFL on 6/7/17. Should we pay her the supplemental PPLO for San Francisco? The other person is on FMLA in Minnesota. I wanted to talk thoughtful our options.	
5	We have a plant manager that hired an employee. This employee was injured on the job and when sent for post-accident testing, he was fired due to the negative results. At that time, the owner told this plant manager he could not hire any more relatives or friends. This week we hired someone through an agency and in reviewing his emergency contacts I see that he is related to our plan manager. The owner is very upset and wants to terminate this new employee. What are your thoughts?	
3	We terminated an employee who was only employed for 65 days. She applied for an received UI, how is that possible.	
1	Employee with poor attendance we are going to release, but we are curious of the benefits of retaining the employee through the end of the month to support her finding another employment opportunity.	
3	One of our hospitals in Texas is asking for a new hire that is terminating after a week of employment, to pay back the cost of background screening, immunizations, badge, uniforms and drug screening costs. They have a document the employee signed stating that if employment terminated within 90 days they agree to have these costs deducted from their last check. Is this legal?	
4	We have an employee who went on maternity leave. She was not eligible for FMLA/CFRA. She requested three months. We complyed, however, she is now stating she cannot come back right now, but would be open to come back later. Can we term her in the system at this point?

4	Employee was hired about 9 months ago to work the front desk. Over the last several months, she has been using the computer system inappropriately. logging in to confidential insurance sites for data that has nothing to do with her job duties. Other employees have stated that she was using the computer to find out employee home addresses and pulling up the employees' property tax information. We do not have evidence of that, only hearsay. She also tried to friend a former employee to find out more about working here. The former employee notified one of our staff and the staff member mentioned it to us. Her actions have made us feel very uncomfortable and she has broken our trust. She was to be filling in on Fridays as part of her hiring agreement, for when some of our employees work a 4 day week. She had called off on the Fridays that we needed her, putting us in a bind. We terminated her yesterday. Reason is poor attendance and the doctor feeling that she cannot be trusted. Because she seems litigious, are there any risks?	
5	We conducted a 6-month evaluation for an employee and he received an partial raise with the rest to come in 3 months provided his performance improves. His co-worker reports that on the commute home that he said he was so mad that he was doing to blow up the company. How should be best proceed? Would be be within our rights to terminate him based on that statement?	
6	Our team is going back and forth on the DC law discussing final wages paid. If an employee is voluntarily terminating employment is it alright to have their final wages paid on the next paycheck (we run a semi-monthly payroll) or do we need to pay them within 7 days as stated in the regs?

2	What should a separation package for a NJ terminated employees consist of, especially from a compliance perspective?	
3	one of my employee on LOA for over a year recently asked if we can "dismiss" her from the employment. can employer take that as employee voluntary resigned and proceed with termination? also can that individual file for unemployment insurance benefit with EDD if employer proceed termination based on employee's wish?	
4	One of our employee has frequently missed work. They are not performing essential job duties and we are considering terminating this employee. Although she has reported to HR that she would be absent the day of, she did 2 no call/ no show last week, and again this week 2 missed days and 1 no call no show. We have emails documenting her performance and personnel issue which she was made aware of. We are expecting to terminate her today due to another no call no show, would this be enough grounds for termination?	
3	A client has an employee that drives for the company. However, he has been admitted to a mental institution for the past three days. Can the employer terminate?	
0	We have an employee with a balance of 7 hours of vacation. Our policy states that if the employee does not give proper notice, they will not be entitled to their PTO payout. The employee did not show up to work on her last day. Are we required to pay her the 7 hour balance she has currently?	
0	We have companies in Rhode Island and Massachusetts and we have an employee handbook. We are creating a new handbook. I was under the assumption that until the new one rolled out, that we couldn't implement any of the changes? Right now the PTO policy is changes where we would pay out PTO upon termination. We are changing the policy - I am going to verify the policy. If it does say that for Rhode Island?	
1	We are firing one of our employees. How many people need to be in the firing? Do it matter is there isnt an HR person present?	
2	Hi, What is the standard timeline for notifying HR of employee termination?	
3	An employee in CO has provided us with one week's notice of resignation. The manager has chosen to let him go today. Does that change the terms of the resignation? Is that true for MN and WI too?	
4	We have a non-exempt employee who gave their two-week notice, however her performance has been going down since she gave her notice. If we let her go after the first week are we required to pay the second week since she gave notice?	
5	Client called - Employee was on vacation Monday and Tuesday, and came back Wednesday. They asked if he wanted to work OT and he said no, I'm quitting but just don't know when. He took a load to their customer later and told them he is quitting. The customer called our client back and informed them of the comment. We are not sure what to do. Can we ask him if he wants to leave today?	
4	We recently let an employee go (yesterday) - She is calling today to pick up her final check, which I'm not sure is ready yet. How long after she is fired do we have to get her check ready?	
4	We have an employee that is being fired next week based on performance issues and I will need to have her pay check ready to give her at the time of her discharge. She has payroll deductions, all pre-tax; Health Savings Account (HSA), Aflac and 401k. I assume that all deductions should be in effect as usual but since this employee has health coverage through us and this health coverage will terminate on the date of her discharge, should I take the HSA amount out of her check? She has signed off on authorization for this HSA deduction but since her health coverage will terminate on the date of her discharge, we aren't sure if we should allow the deduction. If so, should it be posted directly to her account that day? We are a Bank and aren't sure of the legalities of this. Please let me know your opinion or perhaps you could point me in the direction where we could get some good advice. Thanks, Gayle Darling, Accounting & Benefits Administrator

2	If we offer separation & release of liability agreements in exchange for a severance offering, can the severance offering be offered in lieu of employee being able to file for unemployment in other words, have the employee release us from any liability for unemployment benefits in exchange for receiving a lump sum payment now?

He called today with the Board of Directors to ask the 1 month of COBRA premium could be deducted from his last paycheck.	
4	Payroll deduction errors: An employee had deductions coming out of her pay erroneously ($9.89 per pay). We corrected the error and refunded her the money. Then she enrolled in the benefit and we never set the deduction back up. She then left the company. I am issuing her final check. How should I manage collecting the missed deductions? Can I just have the company "eat those costs"?	
5	We had an employee that called in sick on Monday and then has not shown up to work. We called his emergency contact, his father, and his father said he was fine. We would like to terminate. Do we have to pay him for all the days he was a no-call, no-show?

3	This is for out client West Sanitation and Storage. They have an employee who was on W/C and informed the workers comp carrier back in October that they were resigning. The employer was never notified if this. What do they need to do at this point? They ended health coverage in November.	
5	We have an employee that suffered a back strain in August 2016. The employee has not lost any time and we have continued to offer modified restriction/light duty work for him. In September 2016 he had an MRI that showed he actually had two issues, his work strain and a preexisting condition. In November 2016, the work related portion was shown to have reached MMI and given a 5% impairment rating. We understand that he will receive lifetime medical, but wanted to have the employee return back to full-duty so we have continued to work with him and his light duty situation. Recently we thought we were on the road to return when he was sent for a pain management visit. However, his treating physician has only made slight modifications to his work restrictions. Therefore, he cannot return to his regular job and must stay on light duty. We are at a point that we need to hire a full-time replacement. What are our options regarding termination of the this employee? Thank you	
1	Upon termination we cut a check within 24 hours and mail to the employee. We are planning start doing direct deposits for involuntary terminations (We will process the direct deposit within 24 hours; however, it will take 3 days to finalize. Can we do this? We are doing business in Arizona, Texas and Florida.	
5	After an investigation due to conflict of interest, the accused employee resigned. He is giving us 7 weeks notice. we want to reduce it to 4 weeks and in good faith offer him a severance payment. we'll request to sign a general release as a condition for the payment.- a preventive approach. Since he resigned, we'd prefer to dont call it a severance pay- what other term can we use? or the fact that we are asking him to sign a general release implies he is receiving severance. Thanks	
5	Per a client: We terminated an employee on March 6 for attendance issues, drinking on the job, etc. The Manager talked to him about his performance and issues - in the end he decided to terminate when the employee did not show up for work for a few days. About a week later he checked himself into a rehab centre; his benefits run until March 31. I am assuming he is eligible for STD, which could extend beyond his benefit termination date? What, if any, is there an obligation to bring him back to work after?	
5	We have a former Massachusetts employee who we terminated because we have evidence we believe that he broke into the business and stole the petty cash box from our Controller's office which contained approx. $800 - $1K.

5	Obed has a case of worker comp since August of 2016, was attended and his salary was paid by Workers Comp until December 22, 2016 when the doctor discharged him. However, Obed never informed us about this and continues to dispute with the Workers Compensation carrier to have his doctor changed him back to medically necessary. In February we learned of his new status and sent him a letter offering to return to work as of March 3. On day 3 Obed showed up at the office, but reported that he did not feel well to start work, at that time he was offered the FMLA. The deadline to return the documentation from his doctor has already expired. I would like to know what should be the next step to terminate the employee and offer the COBRA.

Are there any risks to that?

4	Follow up to yesterday's isse: We are going to terminate the employee today because she did not provide us with proper docs for her Form I-9 and she only showed up 2 out of 5 days. Although she called, her reasons were that she had to go to the SSA to get a copy of her card, which she lost, and on Thurs & Fri, she said her baby fell and she had to take him for treatment then watch him on Friday. While this may be legitimate, we are a small company and she has proven to be unreliable. Must I pay out her PTO for her working only 12.5 hours? It includes PSL.

3	About 2-3 weeks ThinkHR sent out a newsletter which had an article about an employee who sued an employer for not giving the life insurance conversion notice. That sparked many questions from clients because they didn't realize they had to do this. I'm trying to create a process for us to give to employers which outlines their responsibility. I'm trying to figure out the simplest way to meet the obligations.

She put something on her own credit card that she was going to be reimbursed for. She sent our accounting department an email acknowledging it would come out from her check as a deduction.

4	Employee that is going through a bad relationship and has a restraining order against her husband. Employee is being investigating for a HIPAA violation. The disgruntled husband sent the supervisor a picture of the employee doing a self-nude in her uniform in our restroom. This violates several of our policies - while at work personal cell phones are prohibited. May not use cell phone in a way that would be viewed as obscene. We want to make sure she can't come back and claim defamation of character. The management staff have been told not to open emails from the husband. The supervisor and I are the only ones who have seen the photo. She has threatened to go to the EEOC if we try to do anything to her. She is a female over 40.

He has asked for a wage increase, and we discussed the possibility if he can report to work. He has now been out 4 days in a row. Can we send him a message that basically states if he does not report to work to meet with the client tomorrow, we will have to let him go?

5	We recently terminated a union employee in Florida because he was double cashing his payroll check. He was using his bank's mobile app to snap a photo for deposit, and then he was also taking his paycheck to the local check cashing store to receive cash.

We've attempted to engage in the interactive process with her and she has not returned anything from her doctor indicating that she has a serious health condition.

5	State of Missouri - We terminated our Director of Finance on 2/27 for poor job performance, he was with us a little less than a year. After the termination, we discovered $520 was missing from petty cash. We had agreed upon severance and PTO before we found out about the missing $520. As a result, and after speaking with our attorney we wrote a new letter and stated that we withdrew the original letter and replaced it with this one. He didn't balk at that and signed it and sent it back. Now we've received a notice that he is applying for unemployment and we'd like to contest. What is the best way to go about it?	
4	Termination with final check for job abandonment. Employer emailed the employee on Friday stating that due to her no show no call the employer has accepted her voluntary resignation and that her final check would be in the mail. The employer did not hear back and has reason to believe (for her and co-workers) that the employee has moved however she never submitted new address information to the employer. How should the employer handle the check and old address?	
3	I have an employee who has missed 2-3 consecutive scheduled shifts without notifying us - no show no call. (The good news is the employee is alive, as seen from social media.) I just realized our employee handbook does not address how many consecutive no-show no-call is considered voluntary resignation. Even if it's mentioned in handbook, I believe I have to send them a letter to confirm. 1. Is there a sample letter in the database? I could not find it so far. 2. One key question is how many days should I allow for responding. 3. Benefit related: I need to submit benefit enrollment (life insurance) that will take effect April 1, 2017. The subject employee is included in this enrollment (she already completed application). We may not make 4/1 effective date, is there any required protocol in notifying the rest of employees about the date change? Is it as simple as "Due to staffing change I'm sorry we need to move the effective date to 5/1?" Thank you. Esther	
4	We have a situation where an employee failed to report to work. Instead of documenting the incident, the terminal manager went into the employee's (allegedly withno permission) home to wake her. Things escalated when the employee came in to work and blew up when she was assigned a route she did not want. It was my understanding that she self terminated by walking out. The employee has contacted me stating that she wants her job back and did not self terminate. In summary, she is using the manager's actions to regain employment by threatening to file a police report and contact her attorney. If we give her job back, and address the situation with the terminal manager, can the employee come back on the employer since we addressed the situation with the terminal manager? Is there anything stopping the employee from still going after the terminal manager himself? She is now allegedly telling stories to other employees about how she just wanted to get the terminal manager in trouble	
0	Is it South Carolina Employment law that Upon termination, all employees will be paid for accrued but unused PTO after six (6) months of service according to South Carolina law. DOes that mean anyone under 6 months - a client doesn't have to pay out the PTO.	
5	I wanted to check and see if I can set up a conference call with a prospective client (Dallas). They have an HR issue: They don't know if they have grounds for termination or not. The employee is out on disability. They want to know what they can do. More than 50 employees. Not sure if employee has exhausted FMLA. Employee, Kevin is a foreman. In October, the employee had an accident at work, he said he was attacked by someone, but nobody really knows what happened. There is evidence of drinking at work, he purchased beer, the GPS tracking matches with the location on the receipt that was found in the truck. Statement from a few people, Kevin was seen drinking, appeared drunk. He operates an epoxy machine, one of few employees who have the knowledge or skill. Because of this, management was reluctant to terminate at the time. I filed a WC claim even though the details were sketchy. He was out for months, and Monday he has received a full work release. Previously we had a few times he was able to come in to pick up his bonus and W2. I offered light duty but he texted he couldn't do it. He came back on a Monday for light duty but he was grumpy and begrudgingly working. We decided to wait until he gets a full release. Management is questioning whether we should just let him go. He was never reprimanded for the drinking. Maybe we should just let him come back and take away the company vehicle and give him a one week suspension w/out pay.	
4	We have a dog groomer who refuses to turn in her productivity report at the end of each week. In addition, she is beligerant to her coworkers and disrespectful of others. She has been with us since 2012, but this behavior has only been in the last few months. I have verbally counseled her and written her up and she says she does not care, I can do whatever I need to do, but she refuses to follow our directions. I am sitting her down one last time today with a final warning, but it will likely lead to her termination. Any guidance to offer? Final check? May I mail it to her home if she does not want to come back to the office later this afternoon? She is enrolled in group health benefits.

5	An employee was written up twice in the past. We have a progressive disciplinary policy where we issue a verbal, written and then termination. In May it was a performance issue, October an argument with coworker, last night on the warehouse floor he pulled out his phone in front of two managers and continued a call.

Furthermore, during the period of Indemnity, he will remain covered by the health care insurance policy or be awarded an amount to cover the cost of securing an equivalent coverage". So my question is : can I give the employee money and ask him to fin an insurance or Am I obliged to covered him through COBRA if he wants to?	
4	EE for one year. Has had three warnings regarding attendance and insubordinate and job performance. Final written warning last Tuesday. She reports to VP. She has done the exact same thing she as warned against: she was told not to speak to supervisor about issues unless in presence of HR. She was also late and didn't finish a report on time. We would like to terminate or even consider calling it a RIF. Would just like to talk about our two options.	
0	Yesterday we released a C suite employee. He received a brief letter summarizing the conditions of his final pay. We offered 60 days of regular pay to enable him to search for another position. We also owe him his accrued PTO payout and 2 weeks of severance according to our personnel policies. His insurance benefits will remain active until May 31st. This is my question: Do I go ahead and generate a check for the 60 days of regular pay along with his PTO payout and severance? (all at one time) or do I wait to pay him each payroll for the next 60 days. He also has a flex plan where I would need to take out deductions. Thank you.

We did not receive anything from her physician validating the need for time off despite requesting something several times. I held the position anyway and told her on 1/27 we would give her until the 3/23. If she did not return at this month we would likely not be able to continue to hold the job. She came back to work this week. She requested to do so part time but could not provide a doctor's reason and so I said no and she came back full time. She sent a text this morning which said she was not returning and had a new job. We emailed and texted her and requested a formal resignation letter along with your badge and keys. She did not respond. I'm going to write her a letter but what should I say?	
6	We are in the process of terminating an employee and we are going to tell the employee on Wednesday but the manager stated that he wanted to handle the final check as if it were covering theentire final pay period.

I paid him for vacation pay and "in notice pay." It wasn't severance, he hadn't been here long enough. I don't know how to respond to this? Should I send the discipline and termination letter? Should I attend? It asks how vacation accrues? It accrues at 2 weeks per year. How do I define the in-notice pay?

I have heard similar reports from other staff members about conversations this employee has had that are inappropriate and, at times, sexually explicit. While this isn't the only reason I am terminating her employment, it is certainly contributing to my decision. My question is - can I mention this behavior in my meeting with her during which I will communicate that she is being terminated? If so, can I bring up the direct report's comments?

4	We recently did a layoff and restructuring. We let a project manager and several people in the accounting department go as part of the layoff. We also had to reduce pay in a number of areas to reduce overall expenses. One of the people impacted is pushing back and refusing to take the pay reduction. We told her that unfortunately it is not optional and she can either accept the reduction or we would be forced to lay her off. She is suggesting we are discriminating based on age and that the manager "has it out for her". She also said that we should give her two weeks notice before laying her off since we generally request two weeks notice from resigning employees. The manager explained that unfortunately the two week notice was not an option and if she was not planning to accept the job we would lay her off effective tomorrow (Wednesday). Can we move forward?

4	Hi, We have an employee who has submitted her letter of resignation. Her last day with us will be June 30. I wanted to find out what the final paycheck would look like if we are doing direct deposit. Do we need to provide her with a physical check? Or can we continue to use direct deposit for her final payment, and have her sign an acknowledge that she received the payment? In addition, even though this employee's last day is the 30th. Her final day in the office is the 28th. As she will be off site on a project on the 29th and she has a personal matter to attend to and has taken the 30th off using vacation time. We will be conducting her exit interview for paperwork on the 28th. Given this, do we need to have a physical check ready on the 28th, and have her sign for it, or can we have direct deposit transaction go through on the 30th for this employee?

Is it ok to terminate an employee in the state of California based on performance without previous written documentation?	
5	We have an employee who has been in legal trouble. We have been very supportive and have let him take PTO time while in jail. He was then released to house arrest. He has not reported to work since Monday, and we have not been able to reach him. His father advised there may have been issues with the house arrest, and that he thought the employee would contact us. He has not. We wondered what our obligation is at this time. Our policy states that a 24 hour no call/no show constitutes job abandonment. Secondly, if we are able to consider this job abandonment, our policy is clear about when an employee may not be paid out any accrued PTO upon termination. This separation would generally not allow for this payout. Are we in compliance with Wisconsin law in this regard?	
4	We have an employee issue that has to do with an employee who is listed as a part time CNA, who is pregnant. She works 16 hours per pay period every two weeks (every other weekend). She called in to work on June 3rd stating she was unable to work because she fell at the lake. Since that time she has claimed that she strained her back at work, and has been generally bad mouthing the company, blaming the company for her back problems because of the workload. We were not understaffed at the time and have properly addresses the W/C documentation. The employee's manager wants to terminate the employee because she is rude, has no social filter, and not performing.

4	An employee had been warned several times in the past about her attendance. She was warned that one more absence and she'd lose her job; this was a final warning. She failed to call in or show up today. I'm completing the notice of separation form and I'm not sure if this is a voluntary or involuntary separation.	
5	A supervisor for one of our contractors is having difficulties with his employer. He has a medical condition he was treated for in January and as a result his doctor has given him restricted duty because of the medication he is on. He went to his employer and told them that. Their business is slow and they are asking their supervisors to do more physical work that he is now unable to do. They stopped paying him and he went to look at Kansas state unemployment. The unemployment office asked him if his previous job was available and he said no; the employer is now saying that if he continues down this path they will terminate him and then he won't be able to get unemployment. Is that correct?	
3	We terminated an employee for job abandonment. They are now calling the company. Is there a legal obligation to return the call?	
5	We have an employee that has been here for over 10 years and he has had many write-ups and was on his last one and we are going to have to let him go. I want to know if it looks bad if we give him one month of severance and terminate for performance issues?

5	I am looking to terminate an employee for misrepresenting his criminal record. How would I go about doing that? He said he was court-martialed by the military. His background check was clean. The state police then came in and said he was a registered sex offender. He stated he was having relations with someone in the barracks. How would I go about legally terminating him. He failed to register for 2 years, according to the State police. We were put on a list of employers who hire registered sex offenders.	
2	Our legal counsel wrote a separation agreement for someone over 40 years old. It has a 21-day consideration period and a 7-day revocation period. I'm trying to understand what this means and when I can make the payment. The employee is Spanish speaking, should I have this agreement translated?

1	Follow up to yesterday's issue. We are choosing to terminate the manager who had the inappropriate conversation with the employee (inappropriately addressed a substance abuse issue). This matter is in conjunction with other performance issues we have been having with the manager. Should we discuss all issues at once for termination or discuss this issue with her today and bring her back on another day for the other performance issues and termination?

4	We had an employee resign and put in 2 weeks and end date is supposed to be 3-28. it is not working out.

5	An employee was arrested for something that if convicted for, he could not work for us. We are considering terminating, not for the arrest but because he cannot work 2+ weeks.

5	Re termination. We are trying to figure out something today to let somebody go tomorrow. The employee is being laid off due to lack of work, and he's calling off of work. So, we've been unable to provide his final check. If we have a live check available on Friday, and we call him to come into the workplace, but he does not come in will that meet the requirements to MA state law.	
5	We had an employee with heart problems. He had asked for some off which was granted. When he was to return to work, he called and said that he wouldn't be able to return because his 2nd job required him to work.

He had surgery in October and he said he would be out 2-3 months. 3/12 he was released back to work with a restriction. However, they couldn't bring him back due to the role he was in because of the weight restrictions. They then serveiled him and saw he was fishing and workers comp took off the restriction. The employer laid him off already. I asked about their layoff policy and it is based on seniority. They should not have laid him off if they had gone by seniority.

5	The employee alleged a hostile work environment and wanted to quit. I told him to think about it overnight and send any data he had to support this. The things he sent did not appear to rise to the leve lof a hostile work environment. I spoke with the manager and another co-worker and both gave statements that didn't appear to show a hostile work environment. I shared this with the employee and he quit. We received his unemployment claim and he stated that it was a hostile work environment and that when they reported it to HR, HR did nothing. Did we do enough due diligence?	
1	Question is, if an employee in CO provides us a with a letter indicating their last day will be July 5th. Do we have the ability to leave her sooner..say June 30?

3	We've recently had a few employees separate from the company who owe us money. Our PTO policy allows employees to borrow ahead of their accrual and that they would have to pay us back for any negative balances should they leave the company for any reason. Our benefits are structured to cover a calendar month and employees are responsible for paying their portion for the prorated costs of their benefits through the end of the calendar month in which they terminate. What can we do when the combination of these two things are more than the earnings on their final pay? One of the employees used our company credit card for personal use and owes a balance on that after her final check.	
3	My question is, if at will employee is appealing a termination, and the supervisor has met with employee verbally several times and they have tracked them on paper but never had shown them to the employee, should those be shown to the employee for reason of termination? on top of the improvement plan, evaluation matches the improvement plan. employee is still disputing that she was never informed about lack of performance.

One employee won't call the office, then when he calls he leaves a short message, then they play phone tag. Once he didn't respond all week. We talked about job abandonment, but they never processed a voluntary term. The employee reached back to them on Monday, this is so-so, that all he said. The owner returned the call and left a message telling him to call back tomorrow at 8am, and we will have a job for you. NO call. Then today, called again and left a very short message. They are tired of the phone tag and just want to let him go, but are concerned about unemployment.

Since this time, a patient almost passed away while in her care due to neglect/negligence on her part, she has been late without calling, and most recently, I received video of her sleeping on the job (while she was the charge nurse on duty). We run a geriatric psychiatric unit so her sleeping is a HUGE no-no as it is a HUGE safety risk. Normally, I would terminate immediately however, am hesitant due to the open work comp case. Advice?	
4	We have an employee who stole money from a customer and she was terminated.

She has been on board for three months and is not meeting performance expectations. This is our first termination in California, so we are wondering: What are the requirements for payout in terms of timing? Is commission separate? She had a guarantee included in her initial offer which says "for the first three months you will receive a draw to be paid against payroll and will be assigned against commission earnings." Are we required to pay this out? When do commissions have to be paid out? We have a standard severance agreement - is there any special rule in California?

1	I am reaching out to you today to express our concerns about an employee as well as to our Company rights to protect ourselves. We have an employee who is in his 90 day probationary period whom we are concerned with due to the following reasons and we are considering terminating his employment. Employee has admitted to past drug use and currently is on medication. Our concerns are that his mood changes drastically from the morning to afternoon on any given day. There was a couple volatile incidents that recently occurred between this employee and another employee. We just terminated the long time employee today. The employee who is under his 90 day probationary did not show up for work today. He advised us yesterday, that we would be here for his shift. We are uncomfortable with this employee being on premises due to his recent volatile outbursts. Are we within our rights to terminate said employee?

She has had 2 written warnings and have been provided with a corrective action plan yesterday. Later that night, however, the employee did something else that was "the last straw", so management wants to terminate. The issue is that she wrote at the bottom of the corrective action that she felt her manager was creating a hostile work environment. What is HR's responsibility at this point? The manager has these ongoing issues well documented and they have information to support that everything was done appropriate to their internal policy and process.

This same employee was previously involved as a witness for an employee charging our business of sexual harassment. We are wondering what our best course of action would be. Should we terminate this person voluntarily since he did not call in himself? We are afraid with his mug shot having been on the local news that if customers recognize him at their door, should he get out of jail and come back to work, that our Company's reputation may be at risk.

4	From our client: We are looking at firing/letting go one of our employees due to insubordination and are a little worried about a lawsuit. She is a long time employee- 16 years and no question that she does her job very well. The problem is her constant negative attitude to other employees and to clients about other employees. She was written up about 3 years ago and several conversations/verbal warnings about her attitude. It has more recently gotten to be a big problem with our staff and how she treats them. Cammie wanted to know what she can and/or what she shouldnt do in going forward with parting ways with this employee. Any guidance is much appreciated!	
4	We have an employee that is fairly new, Nov 2016 she was hired. She lives in Mass. and we recently had a national a major training where everyone was invited. She exhibited very unprofessional behavior. The president wanted to terminate. I am still waiting to get details of the incident. The employee today requested to take FMLA which she will not be eligible, but I wanted to go through that.	
3	Fairly simple question here but our client wants an answer from you guys so I'm passing it on. They're a dental clinic with new ownership and less than 10 employees. Due to the transition there will be a small reduction in staff and thus a few terminations due to not need certain positions anymore. They want to know if there is any potential liability or things to be aware of regarding the terminations.	
1	While I was on vacation they hired an overnight employee who quit this morning after working only 8 hours. Can we give him a gross check or do we need to include the taxes?	
2	2 of 2 It's in regards to termination. Out of state. What compliance I need to do? What type of communication do I need for the employees in GA and NC	
2	If a terminated employee is going to have COBRA payments, is it taxable. If it is reimbursement, do you have to get receipts? If you are offering COBRA is that like offering another health plan?	
2	Can you please provide the termination paperwork required for the state of TX?	
6	When is final pay due to an employee who is terminated in TX?	
5	We hired a new employee who started today. He left at lunch and then didn't return. We called him, texted him, etc. I tried the employee's emergency contact (his father) and found out the employee talked earlier to his father and the employee had decided to quit. Should we process his resignation? We have a two day no call/no show policy on job abandonment.	
6	Where can I find regulations for final wages in the state of California?	
1	We are going to lay off one employee in our Utah location. The employee is only one of two individuals in that dept, and his production level is very slow. However, he has a learning disability and we have partnered with a local non profit who have coached him on job performance. So we really like this employee and do not want to demoralize him, but based on overall production, we cannot keep him employed with us. His current position is the final position that we can provide to him, we have transferred him to various positions trying to find the right fit. Can you advise?	
2	Can you fire	
6	We received a notice of claim and conference from the EDD for an unlawful deductions on final and waiting time penalties. We paid the employee moving expenses with the understanding that he was to pay those back if he did not stay in our employ for a full year. He signed off on a deduction agreement. We took the deduction from his final wages, but final pay check. We will go to the conference. How do we calculate the waiting time penalty since we paid him on this last day worked?	
2	Termination in the state of Massachusetts forms and documents.	
5	This is in Texas. We have an employee has resigned and give him two weeks notice. Can we require the employee use up his PTO for one week and then pay him for the second week, but make today his last day?	
2	This question is about FL - is there required documentation that the state mandates we give terminating employees?	
0	To whom this may concern- I have a question regarding an employee who just voluntarily quit. His last day worked was yesterday, June 22nd. However we have to pay him out for his vacation. Would his last day worked be considered June 22nd or the last day his vacation is being paid out until? Thanks!	
2	If an employee gives notice do you have to allow them to work out the full notice time	
2	We are headquartered in WI but we have an employee in NY that we will be terminating. Can you send me a termination checklist, and the required forms for termination in NY?	
2	Can you require an existing team member to pay back a total amount of a loan upon termination? I had just called about this, but was thinking about using this for an Advance, not a loan. Are the rules different on collecting unpaid balances from a terminating team member when it involves loans?	
4	A client has an employee who was hired 4/11/16 and took medical leave 12/21/16. She wasn't on FMLA because she wasn't employed long enough. They want to terminate her now.	
2	Researching severance agreements: for individual or group lay off consideration periods and revocation periods, over 40 and under 40, for different states, for instance MN has a 15 day revocation period CA, GA, MA, NY, TX and IL?	
0	California final pay requirements; employer's payroll for the previous pay period will be deposited to the employee's pay two days after termination. All pay for the new pay period in which termination occurs including unused balance of vacation will be paid on the employee's last date of employment. Is this compliant with California final pay requirements?	
4	We have an employee in Colorado, who was terminated for attendance. There was a paycheck where she was double paid before her termination. Instead of deducting her overpayment at the time immediately, we divided it up into two amounts, which meant the second part was taken from her final paycheck. The ex-employee is saying we can't do that. Is that correct?	
6	When a California employee resigns, the employer must provide their final check within 72 hours. What if the 3rd day falls on a weekend? In this case, the employee gave notice the afternoon of 6/21. Can the employer pay her on Monday, 6/26, or do they need to pay her by tomorrow, 6/24?	
2	My question was about timing of payout NOT policy. Please reread question. Trudy Soucoup	
2	Required termination documents for California. Separation toolkit.	
5	We just hired a new manager. He's worked one day. He's not going to work out. My boss wants to call and send a check. Can we call it casual labor. He claims he quit another job to come work for us. Do we have risk there?	
0	PTO - Paying out necessary at termination in AZ? In HI?	
6	If we hired an employee to work for a year can they terminate at any time. When do we have to have their final paycheck ready? Is the employee signing the contract the same thing as an employment contact? Can THR provide an employment contact?	
5	An employee is allegedly drinking on the job. Another employee claims that he witnessed him drinking, but the employee denies. The employee reluctantly allowed me to search his van, and I found an empty bottle of vodka in his van. I believe that he also smelled of alcohol and his eyes appeared red. I sent him home and told him I would get back to him. We would like to terminate. Can you advise? We do not have a reasonable suspicion testing policy. I am concerned because he works on cars and could pose a danger to himself or others. Can I invoke my right to term him under our at will employment right?	
4	We terminated an employee yesterday for not following directions. She was rude to some parents and they un-enrolled as a result of her rudeness. Her mother called asking for a pink slip to include a reason for termination. Do we have to provide this?	
5	We have an employee who was out from 6/12 - 6/22. This whole period was a no-call/no-show. He returned on 6/22 with a note that is questionable stating he was in a hospital from 6/12 - 6/19. The doctor's name is lined out and there's a signature with a title written in. The name is not printed. Can I call to validate that he was hospitalized? Otherwise, I'm considering termination. He is not FMLA-eligible.	
4	Employee gave birth and is resigning while she's still on maternity leave effective 6/21. Will payout of her accruals affect her SDI/STD? Should I use the 21st as her termination date?	
3	We have an employee contact HR the other day stating that another employee is spreading gossip throughout the company that the CEO is having relationships with employees. This is not true, and the CEO wants to fire the employee.	
1	PA is at will employment state. A part time employee who is not covered under a collective bargaining agreement informed us she was actively looking for full time employment. We do not have a full time position available for her. However, we now have found a person to hire to replace the current employee. Potential hire will also be a part time employee. Can we lay off the current part time employee? It is not a performance issue.	
6	We have employees in the states of MN and WI. They all currently have direct deposit. May we create a policy that requires final checks to be issued as "live" checks and that employees must come in to the office to pick up their final checks? What are our options if they do not have transportation to the office (they normally use company truck). We have too many employees leaving the company and not returning company assets. Can we deduct the cost of unreturned assets from their final wages? Can we invoice them for the cost of unreturned assets? MN - final wage statute says wages due within 24 hours of employee's demand for wages. What is the rule if the employee does not demand final wages, can we issue on next regularly scheduled pay date?	
4	I am terminating a receptionist who was hired about 5 months ago. She is not the right fit for the job - she is not courteous, helpful, or cheerful and is not meeting performance expectations. We have to constantly remind her. What is the reason we should put for termination?	
5	We have a warehouse employee we want to let go at the end of our season. Been with us almost 2 years, first as a very part time , then as full time. Each Feb we hire seasonal warehouse workers and let them go sometime in July. We hired our first warehouse manager in March 2017. He inherited the regular employees bad habits and all. He has told them that no one is guaranteed a job. He would rather let this worker go and keep one of the seasonal people on full time. In his last review (3/17) this employee was given a raise but was also told that he need to work on his productivity, pace, attendance could be improved on and need to take it to the next level on 3 skills. No improvement plan. No formal write up since. Can we terminate saying "no longer in best interest of company to continue the employment relationship?	
2	what documents are employers in Portland Oregon legally required to give employees at the time of termination?	
0	When an employee leaves employment, how much time do you have to payout their personal time off that has been accrued and is eligible for payout?	
2	It looks like I will, unfortunately, need to terminate an employee soon. What do I need to do in order to assure that it goes smoothly? Are there particular forms required, final pay? Also, this individual is on a TN Visa from Canada. Is there anything I need to consider if regards to the visa? Thanks	
2	Hi - Do you have a template to address waiving the right to sue for an employees who are terminated?	
6	We direct deposit all of our employees payroll checks into their bank. A supervisor has asked me this question (below) and I want to know if this is something we can legally do. We have offices in MN and WI Q: When an employee quits or is terminated, can we make them come into the office to pick up their final check?	
1	If the two employees who are affected are being terminated due to different reasons (one is job elimination due to funding the other due to a reorganization), are we required to provide them with the OWBPA notice?	
3	Definition of "Effective Date of Termination". If an employee's last working day for our company is Monday June 26, but we have chosen to pay him through Friday June 30, what is his "Effective Date of Termination"? I ask this question because the vast majority of our employees drive their own vehicles on company business, (to drive to remote oil drilling sites) and we have no control over where and when they drive them. Here is the hypothetical situation: If one of these employees, whose agreed and signed last day of work for us is June 26, were to be driving his vehicle to a company work site, to see a buddy, on June 27, and crashed and killed someone en-route, could our company be sued because the employee's "Effective date of termination" were June 30? Should we always have "last day worked" and "effective date of termination" be the same, and if we want to pay for additional days of service, define those payments as "ex-gratia"?	
2	An employee turned in his keys on Friday and walked off the job. We are interpreting this as his voluntary resignation. Do you have a sample employee separation notice that I can send to him?	
1	Employee was laid off on Friday. We paid him through Thursday. Do we need to pay him for showing up on Friday? What about late payment of wages? The employee is harassing his superintendant with ongoing text messages over the weekend, including at 1am when we think he may be drunk. How can we stop this harassment? Can I pay my employees cash for doing side jobs?	
1	I'm about to terminate someone in the next hour. They are in South Carolina. Is there anything specific we have to provide?	
2	Does an employer with employees living/working in California have to provide the California Health Insurance Premium Payment (HIPP) notice to any terminating employee within California, or can this be posted online/handled in another format?	
4	An employee went on maternity leave, with the intention of returning. She received five weeks of short-term disability benefits, and we kept her on our health insurance plan. Three days before her scheduled return, she told us she would NOT be returning. Does she owe us for the entire health insurance premium for March? She currently owes us for her portion (40%). If she doesn't pay us for March health insurance, can we legally terminate her coverage as of March 1? This employee has also used more than the allowed PTO, and we owe her a small amount of commission. Do we need to pay her for this commission? It's not nearly enough to cover PTO overage and insurance premiums.	
3	We have an employee who may be terminated to be brought on as an independent contractor. Would he then be eligible for unemployment benefits?	
4	We had a temp employee and a regular employee get in a yelling match. I spoke to them both about this unacceptable behavior. The temp is claiming that she's being harassed and bullied. The wrote a letter to her supervisor stating that she has complained about this before and that nothing was done. We would like to let the temp go, can we do this?	
5	We have an employee who was terminated for cause (poor performance). He was told the reason for his termination, but now he wants to know the details of what was shared with the UI.	
0	Our PTO policy states that PTO starts accumulating as of date of hire, but the employee must complete 4 months of employment before becoming eligible to use it. What happens to that bank if the employee leaves after 2 months? Do we have to pay it out if the employee was not yet entitled to this benefit?	
6	The employee works for a New Jersey company but they work from home in Massachusetts so would we follow MA rules in terms of final pay?	
0	If a New York based employee takes vacation before they have accrued or earned it, would we as an employer be able to deduct all of the unearned vacation days back from the final pay check if the employee decides to leave before this has been accrued?	
1	We have 2 employees that we need to let go. What do we need to do to make sure we're in compliance? Do we need to provide explanation/reason for the termination? What are we required to provide them on their last day?	
0	If the benefit year for vacation is tied to anniversary date vs calendar year, would this calculation from DLSE for final vacation pay still be accurate or would we need to adjust it? For example, for a March 30th term date, do we take a Feb 20th anniversary date and then do 10 days of vacation accrual?	
5	December 5th 2016. We had several non-documented performance issues with him. He had a several parking issues and a traffic accident. When I started I requested that we needed to document all issues with him. 3/21/17 (up to and including termination) was his first write up. He was in a verbal altercation with another employee. We wrote up both ee. 3/23/27 the owner found that the van was filthy (sunflower seeds all over dashboard), and he was to come work in the warehouse. He was to switch with the person he had to altercation with. The lead in the warehouse, came and said that he was impossible to work with. Insubordinate, rude, etc. We asked to please and try to work with him, while we try and make this work out. The van had to cleaned out, and the person who is was taking over for him stated that this "problem" employee has been peeing in a cup in the van. The cup of urine then slipped in the van, and perhaps spilled on sterile product. We spoke with him about the issue of him peeing in the van and he has been doing this, and the urine did spill in the van. We opted to move forward with the termination. Our owner is concerned that the write-ups were close together before we moved forward with the termination. Should we be concerned about how this could effect an UI claim?	
3	We have sales employee's that have been on our payroll for several years not, but they only make sales calls. They are not performing their essential job functions. What can we do to remedy the situation as it has been going on for several years?	
2	Follow up: Of the two options you suggested for this terminating employee, is one 'better' than the other?	
1	We have 90% employees are drivers and they have to follow DOT regulations - we don't hire drug or alcohol within the last 5 years - applicant who was approved last week and started today - the person screening missed that there was a conviction on his background check from within the last 5 years. How can we proceed?	
4	We have an employee we are seeking guidance to process termination. This employee approached her manager the other day to leave early, as she stated her home was broken into. We asked for documentation to support the need for leave. She later reported this did not occur, and she was actually arrested for domestic violence and shared she was "off the wagon" abusing prescription drugs. She has come forward stating she is "clean", however with all the drama with this employee - we want to part ways.	
5	It pertains to making sure I'm in the guidelines of the EEOC for a termination of an employee that has been written up multiple times. The employee claimed he was hurt and workers comp denied the claim. He claimed to have been injured the same day he was written up. He has been written up for tardiness and policy violations. We just keep writing him up and he is under 90 days. I don't know what else I can do. Would it look like retaliation if I terminated him now?	
2	Need to confirm termination documentation.	
3	Can you please give me more details about what a Consideration Period is for an employee who voluntarily resigns and is over 40? Do they have a time period where they can change their mind?	
3	Hello. If a team member provides their two-week resignation and we inform them their last day is prior to their two-week notice, is that considered voluntary resignation or termination?	
6	Can I withhold a paycheck from an employee who worked only 6 days and then resigned? I have requested the return of an office key and a signature on a confidentiality agreement. Can I withhold a paycheck until I receive those items?	
0	We phrased our previous inquiry wrong. We have evaluated the guidance on the DLSE website in calculating accruals and simply want to know, if we use an employee's anniversary date - do we calculate on the calendar year? If the benefit year for vacation is tied to anniversary date vs calendar year, would this calculation from DLSE for final vacation pay still be accurate or would we need to adjust it? For example, for a March 30th term date, do we take a Feb 20th anniversary date and then do 10 days of vacation accrual?	
3	All Packaging Company Good morning, The above group had a death of an employee and is running payroll today. His sister is the only know relative and she is asking for his paycheck. They do direct deposit and believe they should go ahead and deposit his check like normal and then the sister can deal with the bank. Do you agree and are there any other things they should consider?

3	What is the employer's responsibility when there is a death of an employee?	
0	Our employee handbook states that if you do not give a 2 week notice when you leave you will not be paid vacation that you have not used. (We are allowed to accrue up to 192 hours of vacation. If not used we will be paid for it at the end of our employment) Is this legal. I have an employee who walked out and quit in the middle of his shift and he has 156 hours of vacation accrued and I really feel like the money is due him since he has EARNED it. Wanted to see what you guys thought about it.	
5	We had an hourly laborer in CT walk off the job. I couldn't find any regulations on how much to pay him. He went to job site to turn in his phone and walked off. Is there a minimum to pay him for that final day?	
4	Hi, we have an employee who resigned her position over the weekend via text. She worked 23.60 hours from her last paycheck to the date she resigned. She also had 32 hours of vacation time. All of it totaling a compensation of $889.60. She did take advantage of an educational program we had established in which we advance/loan money for educational programs of her choice with the condition that if she leaves prior to a certain period she would pay it back (this is in writing and signed). In total she owes $1,123.50 to the company -$889.60 of earn pay, leaving a balance to the company of $233.90. Since she owes the company money, how do we close out her HR file to be compliant? The only way of communication has been via text as she is not calling back. Please advise.	
4	team member is consistently late and absence. We have documented her attendance issues. She asked for PTO and were unable to approve since it is a busy weekend for us with Nascar. She was listed on the schedule but told supervisor, she was not coming into work because she had personal plans to visit family out of town. We are looking to terminate. Do you see any potential risk? Can she collect UI benefits?	
2	mgaboury@pantherrm.com Seeking what is required to delivery to employees at time of termination in Massachusetts.	
5	We had an employee who lives in Texas who worked remotely for us. We are based in Washington state. He was just let go. Which state does he apply for unemployment in?	
1	Some staff want to term people in person while others think it is fine to do the termination over the phone. What is your opinion? We have a 2-day no call/no show policy. If someone doesn't come back to work and hasn't called in for two days, we would process a job abandonment termination. Usually, when someone is terminated we have them sign the termination notification letter. How do we do that if they don't come into the office?	
3	If our company has an employee currently on worker's compensation claim.........and the employee is our for an extended period of time - are we allowed to replace the position?	
4	An employee has a WC injury and was scheduled to return to work for light duty as of yesterday. She was a no call no show. We called her and got no response. Our policy is to terminate employment for those who are no call no show even after only 1 day. We have terminated others in the past with this same policy. How should we manage her considering she has an open WC claim.	
4	I have an employee that has had one sexual harassment allegation. It was true, as we determined from the investigation. She was charged with sexual harassment. She was written up for it. The employee said she didnt mean it to come off that way. She kind of blew it off. We dealt with that. Then there was a second allegation came in for harassment, along the lines of workplace bullying, being obsessed with the persons whereabouts and so forth. When the second allegation came in, it was corroborated by witnesses and found to be substantiated. It was very clear she was told that she has to change and that we removed her entire team, she has no more direct reports. She has been demoted to someone who does special projects, working independently now. As part of accounting she is amazing, but her people skills are killing our company. The two allegations came from two black women, she is a Caucasian employee. When we moved her, she was also put on a final written warning and was given a plan of action to improve. If the plan of action isnt kept or she has additional issues, she would be facing termination. (The final written warning, the president expressed that this is the final conversation they would have with her, mission of company is to have a non-hostile work environment, where people are treated with dignity. They covered the expectations, and put in a plan of action and if stated that if there are related incidents in the future, then she is aware of the consequences of termination.) We recently got a third allegation. It came from the same person that filed the second allegation and it seems like the accused is out to get this employee. The third allegation has also been substantiated. We had a meeting yesterday, reviewed the plan of action, etc. The investigation is complete and from an HR perspective, I have to recommend termination due to liability, lawsuit piece, etc. However, yesterday someone suggested she have emotional intelligence training. If she is already on a final written warning and it's clear she violated the rules around remaining employed after these investigations, we would/should proceed with termination?	
4	We have an employee who was terminated due to conduct and performance. She has requested copies of her employee file and her copies of her performance reviews. We have complied. She told us on the date of her termination that she was going to consult with an attorney. She recently has requested a letter of recommendation. She was let go and we are worried if we were to provide her with something like that she would use it against us in a legal complaint. We dont have a policy or practice of providing these types of letters.	
4	We had an employee who has a history of absenteeism. We put the employee on a probationary attendance improvement plan 2/28 to 4/28. The probationary attendance plan included language which states that the employee can have no absences but any occurrences will be evaluated at the end of the 60 day period and could be excused after review. Absences over 2 consecutive days would require a doctor's note. She's been late one day and she was out on Friday and Monday, and states she's bringing in a doctor's note.	
6	An employee was paid out more vacation than he earned. Can we deduct the amount that he was paid out from his final paycheck?	
5	We have an employee who walked off the job today. What would be his terminate date, when would his COBRA start? How would we make the deductions if he only got paid for yesterday?	
5	EE was injured at work and it's going through WC and had been working on modified duty. Has not shown up for work and we have a 3 days no show termination policy. Can we just move forward with a termination. We know he is represented by an attorney for his WC claim.	
2	Does ThinkHR have a separation packet for California including Cobra?	
5	We have an employee who called several weeks ago stating he was going into rehab. We sent the paperwork for FMLA. He has advised that he has chosen not to return. He has paid sick leave that he chose not to use. Do we have to pay this out to him?	
6	Exempt employee and final pay. Last work day middle of pay week.	
4	We terminated a Massachusetts employee involuntarily. We told the employee we would add an additional comp day since she will not get the check until tomorrow. She mentioned she had a comp days accrued, and the term date was moved to April 1st. Benefits come into play, her benefits will end in April, correct? Would we deduct for the last half of April?	
4	We have an employee who gave resignation notice and she gave two weeks. She gave it yesterday. Friday the 31st will be her last day. Our next pay date is April 7th. This is for hours worked through the 1st. When is her final pay due?	
1	We just caught an error that we overpaid an employee at his exit (voluntary) in the manual check. We're looking for advice on if and how we can ask him to repay the money. Please let me know what you recommend.	
4	We are going to do a RIF at our two locations in a different state. The 5 year leases are up, and we are closing the locations. I've got 12 people impacted, but the biggest concern is the highest level person, store manager #1. Store manager # 2 took a transfer, without knowledge of the RIF. She has been at the new store for 3 weeks. The other store manager #1 will be impacted, we don't have another store manager position to give her. The store whose manager transferred now has an interim manager in place for the store manager role, but that person will go back to assistant manager role. Trying to find positions for the team managers and AMs. I found out today they are going to find a position for everyone except store manager #1. She is in a protected class, age 59. I think they are going to offer her severance, and a stay bonuses. I have a concern about her moving over to another store because the current store manager used to work for her. Store manager #1 has questionable decision making and she did not fulfill parts of her role that could have generated more business. The pay for the assistant manager role is $18/hr and she is currently at $25.5/hr. Can I write up the reasons why she isn't being offered another position? Are we at risk for discrimination?	
4	We have an employee who gave her two weeks notice and then she did a no call no show for three days. We terminated her on the 4th day, and are paying out her her final pay. We want to deduct the amount of vacation she has in the negative. Can we do that? If not, what ideas do you have to recoup the loss?	
1	We have a 33 year old white male that we will be terminating in the very near future. We will be providing him a pay agreement and release. What is the minimum number of grace days that he should be allowed in which to consider the agreement?	
0	Do you have to pay out earned vacation/sick/personal time to employees in NH on termination? If so is there a limit?	
1	3. The store manager we are laying off gave us 6 years of service. Do you have any recommendations for outplacement services? We are considering providing her assistance with job transition. Can we put in $1,000 reimbursement toward any kind of legitimate transition assistance when she submits a receipt?	
1	We have an RIF at the end of the week. Can we use the same paperwork for an employee that we are going to be terminating three weeks later?	
4	I have a long-term key employee that I just got a employment verification for to go to work for a competitor she's 53 has been with us for 11 1/2 years and I'm wondering what my rights are to terminate her today	
1	We have determined we will need to have two job eliminations, following our fiscal year. I am looking for release forms and separation agreements as both employees are over age 40 years.	
6	Follow up question regarding - final checks, and whether we can make it mandatory to pick up. I received two responses, one was short and to the point, the other had reference to the law and seems to be saying, read it and figure out yourself. We decided to treat everyone the same and give everyone a direct deposit. But this has brought up the problem with getting people to come in so we can collect our property. Can we put a policy in our handbook, if you don't give two weeks notice, you have to come in to pick up your final paycheck?	
5	Questions about wage obligations in a typical resignation scenario: Scenario: Employee at Will provides me with a letter of resignation dated Monday June 26, which states that he would like to tender his resignation effective Friday July 7. I am more than happy to send him on his way today, June 26. Q1. Do I have any legal obligation to pay him any wages beyond the end of today, June 26? Q2. Would he have any claim for unemployment, for the two weeks of his "notice period" which I have effectively foreshortened? Q3. Would he have any claim for unemployment after July 7 by claiming I had dismissed him on June 26? Q4. Would he have any claim for unfair dismissal, or, if a member of a protected class, for unfair discrimination? Q5. Even if he were not a protected class, would he have any claim for discrimination if I had allowed other employees to work out, and be paid for, their notice periods? Thank you.	
4	We have an employee who has been on a WC leave for an extended period of time. The position was eliminated during her absence, do we have to reinstate her or can we lay her off?	
3	A client with a total of more than 200 employees is going to be renovating one of their restaurants. The will need to close their doors for about 3-5 months They do not want to lay off the employee's, they want to keep them on-board, but they will not be working. There will be about 20-25 affected employees. What are the legalities with doing this? Do we need to give them advance notice. What happens to the employee's health benefits? Any guidance on how to administer this layoff or furlough would be greatly appreciated.	
3	We have an employee who has called out of work for five consecutive days. They advised that they're "passing kidney stones". We let them know they would need to provide a doctor's note upon their return, to which they replied that they went to a "family clinic" and would not be able to provide a note. Can we terminate this employee for cause & the burden they're placing on our company with their absence?	
5	If an employee gets hurt on the job and we send that employee to a drug test and it came back positive but the employee had an medical marijuana card, can we still terminate the employee even tho he has a medical marijuana card?	
3	what to do with employees pay when they die	
2	Good Morning, I'm looking for guidance on lay off policies. We are a an Illinois company (82 employees) that will be laying off in the next week or two. Other than the required paperwork, Is there anything specific that I need to be aware of ? Thank you!	
4	An employee had given her written resignation with 8 days notice. We were able to fill her position. She then asked if she could continue working a while longer until her new position began. Must we honor that request?	
1	We are in Illinois and we have several layoffs we just had today. 7-8 brand ambassadors were let go. Appendix A Consideration period 45 days? We have several employees who are labeled Job titles and ages of all individuals who are eligible or who were selected for the program (the use of age bands broader than one year, such as age 40 50, does not satisfy this requirement) and the ages of all individuals in the same job classifications or organizational unit who are not eligible or who were not selected.	
3	If an employee provides their notice but the last day falls on a holiday or a day that the office is closed can we make their effective termination date the last day the company was open? Also, if we can make their effective date sooner than the notice they gave, due to the office being closed for the holiday, would we need to pay them out Holiday pay even though their effective date was before the holiday? Last question, can you confirm that the employer is not required to pay out an employees notice if the employer informs the employee that they do not need to work out their notice? How does this apply to employees in CA and those outside of CA.	
5	An employee slipped and fell at work, but initially refused medical treatment. He went to seek medical care the next day, and we opened a WC claim for him. He has not returned to work nor responded to our phone calls to find out his status. The WC claims adjuster told us to send a letter to his home address stating that if we do not hear back it will be considered job abandonment. Can you advise?	
2	Employees were terminated one in North Carolina and one in Georgia. Are there any state form requirements for termination?	
1	We have an older worker whose performance we are not happy with. She's been with us for 15 years and our new CEO does not feel that she is working well with the team. What do we need to know about handling a severance for an older worker?	
1	Loft Opera, Inc. Daniel Ellis Ferris, 562-964-9753; danielellisferris@loftopera.com; Brianna Maury; briannamaury@loftopera.com We will need to furlough an employee because we do not have the funds to meet our payroll. What are the rules surrounding a furlough? We have a total of 3 employees, and this will impact 1 employee. He is enrolled in our health benefits. We have an unlimited PTO policy - no accruals.	
1	Benefits for someone who was let go and has a severance period: Are we obligated to pay health insurance during the end of the severance period or just through the end of employment? Are we able - legally - to cover healthcare costs? We are self-funded.	
2	Thank you! Does this bottom paragraph have to be in here or is this just for HR? Note: Where the release of claims includes claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), the SEPARATION AGREEMENT AND RELEASE must also take into account specific procedures for waiving such claims set fourth in the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA). Let me know & thank you! We are formatting this to use tomorrow morning, unfortunately.	
2	Reduction in Force - do you have any information on RIFs? I'm looking for everything possible at this point. Thanks in advance.	
5	An employee has provided us with is 2-weeks notice. However, he stated that he would like to use his paid vacation hours during his last week. We believe that if he is not going to work on his last week, his last day worked should be his last day of employment. Our policy is to pay out accrued PTO upon termination for those who provide a 2-weeks notice. Please advise.	
1	We have five people who will be exiting as a result of a company restructure. All will be receiving a severance agreement and three of them are over 40. I want to understand what my obligation is in terms of timing for how long we must give them to consider the agreement as well as whether we are required to give them a list of the impacted individuals over 40. The three people are located in Virginia, Washington state, and California. We have about 65 people total in our company, the vast majority are in Utah with a handful located remotely.	
2	I have a question about E-Verify. If I receive an SSA TNC and the employee chooses not to contest, what am I legally required to do? Do I need to terminate this person's employment?	
6	Please send me any reference documents about final paychecks, such as how long do we have to pay a terminated employee vs. an employee who has resigned. What documents are needed as proof/backup that employee received final check. Thank you.	
4	We are planning to terminate an employee tomorrow and one problem is that the employee is a whistleblower (she reported an inappropriate behavior issue in January of this year) but they are not being terminated for that reason. We have documentation that identifies that were performance problems prior to that. The employee was going to be termed for violation of policy, substandard work, etc but we didn't terminate. We verbally had a conversation about the issues and she knew she was about to be terminated at that time (this was in October 2016). We made the employee full time in January this year; she was an outbound medical assistant who also worked part of the time in the back office doing diagnostics. We've had numerous complaints from employees that she doesn't work or is on her cell phone. We have emails from supervisors, the CEO and I've seen it. For the new issues, her supervisor has given her a verbal but it was a group verbal, not singling her out. The other employees have have complied. Now the supervisor is on leave now. She's also been late significantly (45 minutes plus) frequently.	
2	Layoff of 7 people out of 83, pay date, COBRA and WARN - can you provide information.	
4	We recently opened a restaurant on May 8th. We have a 90 day probationary period and we are an at-will state. Yesterday I terminated someone and she is hinting about an age discrimination claim. She was terminated due to violation of company policy and job performance. She was initially hired into the role of a marketing our catering and she did not do well. We then provided her an opportunity to be a lead and she did not perform to our expectations. Should we be concerned?	
1	We fired someone for no only having another job that was a conflict of interest, but for doing that job while on the clock with us. He was fired yesterday, which was the first day of a pay period. We are submitting payroll today, for the previous two weeks. Are we able to hold that pay, until we find out if has stolen money from us, which we suspect? Or, do we pay it, and then just try and get the money back a different way?	
6	regarding when you terminate an employee and they have a uniform provided buy company. can amount be taken out of final check until they return it?	
3	If I have an employee that has only been working with me for 60 days, is he/she still in a period where I can make a determination to terminate employment or do I still need to document reasons for termination and take the same steps I would for a long term employee?	
5	Termination - Employee was in a vehicle incident last Wednesday. He called into the supervisor and then disappeared for 4 hours and was not reachable. GPS tracked vehicle which kept moving as it was being towed. The employee would not answer calls. He showed up later, went to the industrial clinic and passed a drug test. He was asked by paramedics during the incident if he needed medical attention and he said he was OK. He told us the tow truck driver took him to a Jack in the Box and left him there. We terminated him for not follow procedure. The employee is not happy. He is saying he felt it was unfair to terminate him and thinks its about the incident. He is complaining of back cramping and aching. Says he needs care and doesn't understand the lack of care received by the company.	
3	If we have an employee who is terminated for a positive UA. What are we allowed to say if an employer calls asking why they were terminated? Not sure what kind of information we can legally give out to future employers for this individual.	
3	An employee gave two weeks notice and their last day would be on the 4th of July and the business is closed on July 3rd and 4th. Can they accept their resignation early, on the 30th of June, and then not have to pay for the July health coverage premium?	
5	One of the managers sent an email - Employee is trying to collect unemployment, been in jail for two months. Every manager has always told me to let them know when he gets out. At first his mother told us he needed leave for medical leave. We didn't fire him initially because we thought he might have a medical condition. We want to know if he is going to be able to get unemployment	
3	What is an employer obligation to complete reference checks?	
6	When someone quits, when do we have to provide their final pay? We are in California but the employee works in Arizona.	
4	Hi, Can employee collect unemployment benefits, if she put 2 weeks notice but we ask her not to come back after only 1 week?	
1	We have an employee who has been with us for about a year and last week we noticed in a local news paper that she got herself into some trouble with the law. Than this week she approached the general manager and said she will be going away for a couple of months due to a conviction. She will start a sentencing next month. Couple questions in regards to this case of future cases like this. Do we have to terminate this individual right away? If an individual committed a crime but has not been charged when can we terminate that individual? Do we have to hold a position for them when they return from jail? What ground of termination do we use since the crime committed is not work related or it does not affect work performance?	
1	Can we lay off someone while on FMLA	
3	an exempt employee gave two week notice, if we the company decide to end his employment before the end of the two week notice I'm I required to pay him the two weeks ? or can I end his employment today and only pay him up to the end of today his eight hours?	
6	If an employee gives us more than 72 hours resignation notice, how long do we have to pay them their wages? Do we need to pay them all wages on their last day or do we have 72 hours to provide final paycheck?	
5	Our client Rehkemper & Son is asking the following question: We have an employee, Jeffery Brandmeyer, he is out on workers comp and Mike has no intention to bring him back once he is released. Jeff has health insurance thru the company, can we cancel his insurance or do we by law have to keep him on the health Insurance until he is released from Works Comp.? Please advise. Thanks,	
4	An employee notified me yesterday that she wants to resign because she is not making enough money and we do not offer OT. I spoke to her today to ask her what her estimated turnaround time is, and she said she did not know. We cannot be left hanging on this, as we have to plan to replace her. How should I manage? Can we let her go if we find a replacement employee?	
1	We had an employee that we let go and provide them with severance waiver/agreement letter for them to sign and get back to us. They are coming back asking us to cover premiums for next month or two and that was not part of the agreement letter. Best practice, is this something we should do? This type of arrangement?	
3	I have an employee that I would like to terminate today and would like your feedback on the reason.	
5	Employee has been with the company 7 months. On 5/22 they received a off work notice for 5/23 - 5/29, employee never returned to work on 5/30 and has not been heard from since, nor have they recieved any further documentation about extending his off work order. Paychecks have stopped since he was a sales person and their have been no sales. He is still enrolled on the company medical plan and they would like to terminate his coverage as of 7/1. Several emails have been sent with no response and his voicemail is not allowing any new messages.	
1	We have an employee who has been with us for a period of a year we have moved them a few times based on their slowness. This is a chronic complainer, and likes to stir the pot. We simply want to fire him however there are some red flags (e.g. his race, he complained of safety concerns, etc.) Can we just call this a lay-off?	
3	What is the process for unemployment insurance? We had a formal employee submit a claim for UI and we would like to know what to provide to the state?	
4	F/U: An employee was terminated for performance. We had her sign a separation agreement. I just received a UI notice. She's indicated she was laid off for lack of work. I am going to be honest and fill it out appropriately. Discharge - synonymous with termination? It is pretty specific - provide copy of policy. It was really performance that was verbally addressed with her. Is that fair to include a copy of these pages? If she gets UI (she only worked for us for 90 days) how is our rate affected and what is the look back period?	
2	Severance - are there guidelines or regulations/laws around severance payouts? I know 1 week = 1 year, but wondering if there are minimum requirements on this topic.	
2	I wanted to discuss a case about my friend who was terminated yesterday. I'd like to hear if you think it was wrongful termination.	
1	We have a minority owner Director who is also an employee of the company. We are going to terminate their employment. Other than the typical CA Employee Termination documents that we would provide to any other employee, what else needs to be provided to this individual regarding their stake in the ownership of the company?	
3	We received a call from one of our clients. The CFO said they had a service technician who sent an obscene text message to a female employee after hours. They want to terminate, but are concerned that because it happened after hours and not "at work" that they may not be able to do this.	
1	We are looking at laying off an employee. I just have a few questions about permanent layoff verses termination.	
3	If an employee quits and gives two weeks notice and declines to get final pay can we accept that and pay with the regular payroll? I have always been confused because I swear - and I cannot find it now - that ThinkHR told me we could wait if the employee voluntarily requests it? ID Tech, one of my prior companies, allowed employees to check off if they wanted to wait. I stopped that practice, but I have always been confused because of what I was told in the past, as far back as when I worked for Southern California Rehabilitation services and ID Tech.	
2	Can you please provide information about layoffs and reduction in force as we discussed by phone earlier today? (Issue 2 of 4)	
3	Our insured, Atlas U-Pull, has an employee that has had 3 work comp claims in the last year. 2 of the claims are closed, but one is still open. The employee has returned to work and is doing "light work" for awhile until they're fully healed. The employer is looking to layoff the employee, not because of the work comp claims, but because they're downsizing the company and the employees position is no longer needed. The employer is worried that laying off the employee could result in a lawsuit. Can you help me understand the employers options for laying off an employee with an open work comp claim? Thanks, William Velin, wvelin@apminnesota.com	
6	Want to make sure we are not legally liable: We have a terminated employee we issued a check out to on September 29, 2016. He never cashed the check. Paylocity just notified me of this check that it has expired because it is over 6 months old. They are going to put the money back into our bank account. What should I do with this money. This was a final check to the employee. It was a final check that was handed to the employee.	
5	Please call me back at 00447710844548 regarding a recent termination. Employee in Florida was terminated and he has sent us a letter that I would like to discuss with you. Employee had a performance issues, availability for meetings and travel. He was told he needed to improve, place on a PIP in the next 30 days. After he was was placed on a PIP and no improvements were made. The employee was also was unable to meet with the sales person that he supported. Additionally, his counter part, a female, said that he had been saying inappropriate things to her and making her feel very uncomfortable. At the same time COBRA notices were sent to all employee's. We contacted HR and then advised us to terminate him based on performance and not on the alleged sexual harassment, therefore an investigation was not conducted. In his letter, he is stating that he was terminated before the meeting was held (because he got a COBRA notice) and before his 30 days. He also said that it was the female colleague that was harassing him and that she was the one who came on to him. He is asking for the employer to pay his wages and health benefit to June. How should we respond?	
0	We have an unlimited PTO policy that includes sick, vacation and personal leave. As such, we do not formally track or accrue our PTO. We have employees in the state of California. How should I be handling payment at the time of resignation or termination for unused vacation or sick leave if it is not tracked or accrued since we have no PTO "bank" to draw from, from an unlimited amount of time off?	
4	We have an employee who has been employed for two weeks. She is a little off. She was preaching religious things to the teachers. They have had to tell her things multiple times. Odd behaviors. On Monday she called out sick. We had a lot of complaints. She is out today but didn't call in. They want her gone. Can we call her and say we do not want her back?	
0	Policy handbook states that any unused accrued PTO will not be paid out upon termination. An employee at the North Dakota location is saying that North Dakota state law requires for accrued PTO to be paid out at the time of termination. Most of our employees are located in Texas, so we are less familiar with ND state laws and regulations. Please advise.	
3	Hi our company has projects all over the United States. We have an Field employee who was let go and claimed unemployment in the state of Oklahoma. She was granted unemployment. However our company does not pay unemployment to Oklahoma. We do pay Missouri. How will that work? Will Oklahoma gets funds from Missouri Unemployment?	
4	We have a temp that has been on maternity leave last July. From July until now she has been on paid leave. She is ready to return to work April 3rd. Right now there is no job available for her. Is she eligible to apply for unemployment at this point, and if so what date does she need to put on her claim? What is our responsibility if she does not get a job with us? We are a temp staffing agency	
0	We have employees in North Dakota and the corporate office is in Texas. We have our employee handbook that states that the vacation is not paid out at the time of termination. Is this the same for North Dakota? Is it a law that we have to pay out the available vacation that the employee has at the time of termination?	
5	We deal with unions so there are two sides to this. Would be easier to discuss. We are laying someone off. Can you give someone time off because you suspect substance abuse? Longtime employee (12 years) he has had problems in the past and he works on his own. He is paid through the union. Typically you can do union/lack of work. This is true we have no work. But a GM has been paying him for no work. He costs $300,000 a year. Our customer suspects he's drinking on the job and he is only working 2-3 hours a week. They suspect substance abuse and we have smelled alcohol on him. We've kept him on salary for over a year without him performing. We let the old GM go. Our work has gone down a lot and we have a project manager on the customer job. There are other people being affected in Alameda County. We're willing to do a LOA. Do we say anything about a leave till he gets better? He has not disclosed a problem. He's in the union we can just lay him off. It is so expensive to talk to attorneys. He has our truck - we're liable.	
5	An employee was on medical leave for Jan and Feb. He is eligible for FMLA. His anniversary date is Jan 31. He resigned after his return from leave. Must I pay out his accrued vacation that he would have had after Jan 31?	
6	When an employee in CA gives two weeks notice can we wait until the next payroll cycle to pay them their final wages? Or should we have that final pay ready for them on their final day working?	
1	We are looking for guidance with respect to a shift in our internal procedures that would eliminate one employee's job function. The employee does a specialized type of billing that has been separated from the billing department. Considering moving the function into the billing department which would eliminate the need for this individual.	
5	Termination today, but they want to keep him on payroll so he appears to be employee and it's easier for him to find another job. Questions about severance, 21 days review period and revocation period.	
2	I have two questions: 1. sample letter on eliminating the position of Administration assistant	
5	(On speaker with Executive Director): Our longest tenured employee is in a mid-management level position and supervises staff. We have had issues with supervising and managing staff. We need to make a move but we do not want to let him go. We would like to eliminate the position he is in and offer a revised role with the same pay. This role would take away the supervisory/management duties. Are we in the clear explaining that we are restructuring and eliminating the role and defining new positions and that we do not feel he fits any of the new roles but that we have something else for him. If he refuses the new role and left due to restructuring... There my be a domino effect. We want to have each of the 3 locations be run independently and report to admin on their own. He is under age Caucasian male. We have had umpteen conversations with him. A review of our team resulted yesterday in a recommendation to let him go. If he declines, would he be resigning?	
4	Hello, We have a very part time employee that cancels alot of her session because she has another job. She has been with our company for 1 year and since starting has decreased her availability more and more where she is currently only working with one of our clients. She recently submitted another change of availability and it does not work with our business needs, and we would like to move forward with terminating her. Can you please share best practices from an employers point of view for these situations. I was told by her manager that the employee knows that her request was denied as it doesnt meet our needs and that the employee also knows she is going to be terminated. Thank you!	
1	In our offer letters we have a statement about at-will employment which states that the employer or the employee can end employment at any time. Does this mean that we do not have to have a reason or documentation when we terminate an employee? We have an employee who was demoted due to performance issues, he was after the demotion making must less money, so he quit. Should we have documented the performance issue and gotten a resignation letter? We had an employee who was demoted because of personal issues due to her own request and her pay was cut as she's now working a part time hours, what kind of documentation should we gotten for this change?	
6	Shima - HR rep for MarkLogic and Simon Elliot from CBIZ on phone. Employees are being let go with only one day of service for their final wages. How do we manage the deduction for the FSA and HSA contributions if the contributions are greater than the total wages?	
2	Are service or separation letters required in Washington?	
2	if you lay a person off because you are getting rid of the position how long do you have to wait before you can reinstate that job but with a different person?	
2	An employee is terminating on Friday and although everything is amicable I want to be sure I provide the correct information required by the state. Can you confirm with me what those documents are?	
5	An employee is being terminated and has unpaid obligations to the company. Can we deduct or bill him for the cost of product he purchased on the company credit card that the company never needed, cannot use and was not approved in advance as per our policy?	
1	I need to determine if the California WARN will apply for us. We have a branch with 165 employees in California. Approx 8 to 10 employees will be affected with a layoff, while the balance of the employees will be moved to different branches (each within 15 miles of the branch that is closing).	
5	An exempt employee says he can't work the required hours of his job anymore, how do I terminate?	
0	Have a small client that wants to make sure they are compliant with vacation policy. On an employee's 1st anniversary, they receive 10 days of vacation to use. If the employee voluntarily quits, is the client required to payout any unused vacation time?	
0	If a new employee is within their 90 day probationary period, and begin to accrue vacation time...but they are terminated during the 90 days are we required to pay out the accrued time - even if they are ineligible to use until after the 90 days?	
5	We have an exempt employee who has been coming late and calling out. We have documented all his occurrences and may be moving towards termination. as he is out of all banks of paid time off, can we dock his pay?	
5	We have an exempt employee who has been coming late and calling out. We have documented all his occurrences and may be moving towards termination. as he is out of all banks of paid time off, can we dock his pay?	
1	We have an exempt employee who has been coming late and calling out. Proper documentation for a termination due to tardiness and absenteeism in CA.	
4	I have a question regarding California's state sick leave law. An employee was hired two weeks ago and has been late to work twice and has missed two days (non consecutively). The manager wishes to terminate her. Is that okay even though she has 24 hours of sick leave available on day one? She did not say the late days were related to illness and she was issued a verbal and written warning for those two instances (which is consistent with our policies/practices).	
3	Sales manager in Texas and will be laid off.	
4	We feel a former employee may continue to be a problem for us based on several incidents both before and after termination. How can we reduce negative exposure from her? For example, when she was active she made up the story that her boss who longer worked for us had promised her a promotion and $2/hr increase but was never given and she wanted us to backdate the promotion and the increase. We agreed to make it effective from that date on since since we found no proof. After termination she contacted our broker stating I had agreed to allow her to remain on group benefits and then called me and said the same of the broker. When she terminated she deleted and purged 3 years worth of emails. How can we protect ourselves from her?	
2	Texas Separation Packet?	
2	Can you send me information on terminations in California?	
4	The employee is not following protocol. We found further evidence that she may be taking tips that should be shared. She has been an employee for 10 years and she should know the process.	
4	Employee worked for us over a year. Put in resignation notice 2.5 weeks ago stating she wants to stay until 4/4. I'm back filling the position and the transition is completed. Can I have her leave today?	
1	EE gave notice and we are thinking of paying out the notice period and having her stay home. Can we do this?	
5	We have an employee who has worked for us for about five years. He has a social security card, etc. On March 8th he stopped showing up for work. He isnt married, but has a girlfriend and they have a child together. We recently heard that he got in a fight with his girlfriend. They took him to jail to cool off. His family bonded him out, and the next day INS was waiting for him. I have his check here and both his girlfriend and aunt want to come get it. We terminated his insurance, but havent done anything else. What should we do?	
3	We reached out to SWIM on 3/24 to ask (Starting April 1 & running through July 31, our company plans is issuing a mandatory furlough where our employees must take off 3 per month. Will NJ allow them to collect unemployment for the time they are being furloughed?) SWIM responded - "An employee may collect unemployment benefits if the employee is underemployed or unemployed. In addition, we have provided information on furloughing employees..." They then explained on the Non-Exempt and Exempt Levels and Circumstances in Which the Employer May Make Deductions for Pay." We know need to know: Do we need to furlough all of our employees by the same amount/percent of time or can you furlough 1 person at say 10 hours & another person 3 days? Also, the company is looking to cut just one hourly employees' pay by $1.00. Is that allowed? Note: Our original Q&A (3/24) was thru pwhitney@thoughtfulclassroom.com in case you need cross reference/see previous correspondence. Thanks, Trisha	
2	Employee resigned yesterday, walked out. Supervisor emailed me and I spoke with the employee. I wanted to verify what paperwork to provide him, is it different than when we terminate someone verse resignation?	
0	cc: Barbara.polk@greatclips.net An employee is eligible for health benefits after 3 months, but will not be eligible for vacation accrual till after 6 months. The employee would like to take about a month and a half of vacation in December.	
1	We are terminating an employee in Texas and the person who is terminating is in California. Therefore, the termination will be done via a Skype like app. Can we record the meeting? If so, does the employee have to be notified? What is recommended?	
6	It's a pay check question. If someone quits and they have $600 worth of uniforms outstanding, can I withhold their check until we get them back or deduct the money from their check?	
4	We have a long time employee who is currently working three days a week and we really need a full-time person. She is unwilling to work full-time. She is aware of the situation and understands that she may need to retire so the spot would be open for a full-time person. Are we within our legal right to dismiss her if she doesn't retire?	
4	We have an employee who is in her 90 day probation. She has been out excessively, tardy, etc. Last week while they were putting together the disciplinary forms for termination together, we found out that she was in a slight fender bender and has a slight concussion. She provided a doctors note saying for a couple of weeks allow her to work part-time / work half days if needed if she isnt feeling well. She has left early a couple of days. She had been talked to about her attendance and tardiness in the past. In her 10 weeks of being employed with us, she only has worked her full scheduled hours, one of those weeks. They want to let her go tomorrow, but now are nervous because of the entanglement with the medical issue. Additionally the doctors note looks like it is from a pediatrician, with child scratched out, markings and information that had to be scratched out then rewritten. It looks strange.

5	Hi, We have an employee that works on night shift and during his shift last night he advised his supervisor that he was going to work on this personal truck. The supervisor thought he was going to clock out and work on his truck, however he did not clock out until the end of his regular shift and he did not report PTO, therefore it appears he falsely recorded time that he was not working. If confronted we know he will advise he forgot, however if he did forget he should have mentioned that he forgot to his supervisor. Is this grounds for immediate termination or would a 2nd level write up or suspension be more in line? Thanks! Loretta

6	I was looking through the legal guidance for final pay for separated employees and in Virginia it says final pay is due on the next regular pay period.

3	Hello, We have an employee who was hired prior to a background check being completed. Normal practice is for the check to be completed prior to the offer being made. The employee signed the Certification and Release for the background check and denied any moving violations and if she was currently awaiting trial for a criminal offense. She also signed an offer letter and handbook acknowledgement stating that : "Falsifying an employment application or any other Company records or documents may result in termination". The employee's background check results included a 4th Degree Grand Larceny Felony with a scheduled court date: 4/17/17, a drivers license suspension and poor credit history and bankruptcy. The employee started on 2/6/17 as an Executive Assistant to two company officers, having access to sensitive company information including a credit card. The employee has been absent for 5 days, taken as un-accrued time off. There have also been fraudulent charges on the officers credit card account since the employee in question started. The charges are pending investigation by American Express. The employee was terminated over the phone by her Manager yesterday as the employee was home ill. What type of termination letter should be sent to the employee? Is the termination reasonable for falsification of her application which violates company policy and practice?

3	I have an employee who went to jail for unknown reasons causing him to miss 2 days of work unexcused. This normally would lead to the employee being written up. If this employee is written up for this we will have enough write ups that would normally lead to a termination. Can we terminate an employee who missed work due to being in jail? Employee works in the state of VA.	
1	We have an employee that contributes to the 401K. We are paying them a severance. Are we required to take out the 401K out of their severance payment?	
0	Do you have to pay all PTO out on last check or can it be done over a period of time?	
2	We are about to send a severance package to an employee and there is language in here with a 21-day consideration period and a 7 day revocation. Is this necessary? The employee is under the age of 40.	
5	We have an employee who has abandon his job. He vanished for a few days, and then said he needed time to take off for personal issues. Then we never heard from him again. How do I make sure this is resignation by "job abandonment" and not being fired?	
4	Met with Carrie, feels she has gone out of her way. She asked from a leave and given one before diagnosis. Carrie told her she is not having her return to salon due to disruption, another job available. Natasha - set new expectations, will write it down and will have her sign when she comes in. Natasha tried to get her to come in to get her check, Maggie said she doesn't have money to come get her check. I'm not asking the owners for money, but it would be nice. I deserve compensation for this, everything I'm going through. Now she says she broke her wrist, he slash me, going to ER. Next thing we know, we get a call from her lawyer, they want permission from us for her dad to pick up her check. We told him we would need a signed written permission from Maggie to release the check. What to do? We don't want her back.	
5	An employee did not come or texted Monday or Tuesday. Wednesday he texted us saying he is doing side jobs.

4	An employee called in saying she needed to be off for 1 week. We called and spoke to spouse asking him to let her know we'd need certification for leave under FMLA to care for family member. He told us she may be out 1 month but that he'd have her provide certification. Three 3 weeks later, the employee shows up and tells her manager the truth that she was in jail and is ready to return. We want to terminate for dishonesty and for violating our no-call/no-show policy. Can we do that without out her saying it's cause she was in jail. She'll also need anger management classes which we're not concerned about.	
3	Follow up from yesterday. What is the WA state UI brochure that must be given? The EE earns commissions. When must commissions be paid out?	
3	A salaried exempt employee in NY has been MIA for the past 2 weeks. She was given time off for the passing of her mom, but has not returned or contacted employer since. The employee has not returned calls or emails from employer. May employer claim job abandonment? They do not have a policy on job abandonment.	
1	Asking on behalf of client Kearney Clinic: I was wondering if you could give us some advice on a situation that happened this weekend with one of our employees. This employee was just recently hired for the front desk as part time for our extended care for week nights and weekends. Well this weekend, he must have assaulted his girlfriend and broke her arm. We found this out by another patient (who is friends with this girlfriend) who came in for a visit. One of our doctor's also seen this patient at the hospital for the treatment of her broken arm. Peggy Dobish (our administrator) and myself are looking more into the situation as well. We were wondering that since we are an "at-will" company and deal with patient interaction, would be be in the clear legally to terminate this employee for the safety of our employees and patients?	
6	We have an employee in Hawaii who just gave his notice of resignation. He has given more than one pay period's notice. We are looking for clarity on when we have to pay an employee who has provided notice of resignation. Is it like CA where you have to pay final pay on the day of separation or can it be paid with the next payroll?	
2	We are issuing a severance agreement to a CA employee over age 40. We want to confirm that he has a 21 day period to sign the agreement, and a 7 day revocation period. Is that correct? If he chooses to return his signed agreement sooner than 21 days, when do we start the 7-day count?

5	gross misconduct - employee threatened to hit the manager. The manager told him to clock out and sent home until further notice. He came in the next day and was sent home pending investigation. We are decided to terminate and wondering if I have to bring in to do the termination. My manager is concen fo his safety.	
5	I was wondering if I could get some advice on giving information to other employers about a past employee. We terminated a manager for "misappropriation of company funds". We reviewed his post close adjustments and the amount of food comping that he was doing. It was excessive and inappropriate. He would comp food for people who he said were training but they weren't. Things like that. Now another restaurant group is asking me for information on why we termed him. I am wondering the best thing to tell them or if it's best for me not to tell them. They have already hired the person and the HR person says that she thinks that he lied about the reason he left my company. I am assuming if I tell her what I just told you they will fire him. Any advice?	
3	If an employer has a policy which includes coverage through the end of the month, can the employer take the full month's deduction when they terminate in the beginning of the month?	
2	Are there any documents I have to give to a terminating employee?	
4	My question is how to handle closing out an employee that has been arrested. Missed a shift on Wednesday and Thursday. Her mom called on her behalf. When we close her out, we typically have them sign off. If she is unavailable, how should we handle that?

6	In VA, we have an employee whose last day with us is 7/5. Our pay cycle is bi-weekly and we pay for the previous 2 weeks in every other Friday. Our pay dates in July are 7/7, (which covers 6/19-7/2) and 7/21 (which covers 7/3-7/16). For the departing employee's hours worked on 7/3-7/5 (his final paycheck), should we pay on 7/7? Or, would it be fine for us to wait until 7/21?	
4	An employee submitted her resignation and she has been a gossip and trouble start in her department. I want to honor her resignation early and I know I have to pay her to the end of the notice. Do I have to give her a letter with why? What I've heard is that there's a new girl (that I am also terminating today) wanted to order office supplies and asked for pens (which were not approved) and the girl said "bitch" about the manager who didn't approve the pens order. The other girl said a supervisor told her "you're lazy" etc.	
3	Someone (I'm research who the call came from) just notified our company that they found a backpack belonging to one of our employees at a jobsite. We are a construction company in CA. When the caller looked inside the backpack, to determine who it belonged to so he could return it, he found ID belonging to our employee and a vial of hash oil. What are the employee's right to privacy in this situation? What can we as employer do to terminate or discipline the employee? Our stated policy in our handbook states: ... possession of drugs on the job or on a job site...violates our policies...enforce this policy, [we] reserves the right to conduct searches of Company property...the Company must keep people who sell or possess controlled substances off Company premises in order to keep the controlled substances themselves off the premises...At manager discretion the employee will be subject to: Voluntarily take a drug screen and pass it a OR Resign from their position."
